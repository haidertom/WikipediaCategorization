'''Amira Abase''', '''Shamima Begum''' and '''Kadiza Sultana''' are three British schoolgirls from the [[Bethnal Green Academy]] in London who left home in February 2015 to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). According to the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries have travelled to join the Islamic State as of 2015&lt;ref name="TMDUPGIP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltman|first1=Erin Marie |last2=Smith |first2=Melanie |title='Till Martyrdom Do Us Part' Gender and the ISIS Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=Institute for Strategic Dialogue |page=4|url=http://www.strategicdialogue.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Till_Martyrdom_Do_Us_Part_Gender_and_the_ISIS_Phenomenon.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—part of what some&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hegghammer, an expert on Islamist militancy affiliated with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (source: {{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}})&lt;/ref&gt; have called "a jihadi, girl-power subculture".&lt;ref name="isowbw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The three girls had been questioned by the police in December 2014 after another girl from their school travelled to Syria, but were found not to be at risk.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; They flew via [[Turkish Airlines]] from [[Gatwick Airport]], London, to [[Istanbul]] on 17 February.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria girls: Families 'cannot stop crying'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31575908|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their families went to Turkey in March to probe the disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isil defector girls' families go to Turkey to probe disappearance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11491142/Isil-defector-girls-families-go-to-Turkey-to-probe-disappearance.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a [[Glasgow]] woman who joined ISIL in 2013. There have been electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; She faces criminal charges if she returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scots jihadi will be prosecuted if she comes home, say police|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/313329-scots-jihadi-aqsa-mahmood-will-be-prosecuted-if-she-comes-home-say-police/|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=STV|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmood denies the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=James|title=Glasgow 'jihadist' Aqsa Mahmood denies recruiting London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-31908202|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, on a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher [[Anjem Choudary]] against the film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]''. The [[Metropolitan Police]] examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Ben|title=Jihadi schoolgirl's father marched at flag-burning rally|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/jihadi-schoolgirls-father-marched-at-flagburning-rally-anjem-choudary-10138591.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussen said in April that he feels ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of schoolgirl feared to have joined Islamic State denies 'extremism' claim|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-04-07/father-of-schoolgirl-feared-to-have-joined-islamic-state-denies-extremism-claim/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=ITV News|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flight. They will not face criminal charges if they return to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=David|title=Three 'Jihadi brides' from London who travelled to Syria will not face terrorism charges if they return|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11461693/Sisters-of-the-missing-jihadi-brides-to-face-radicalisation-tests.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on its circumstances in March 2015.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The families of the girls received an apology from [[Scotland Yard]], who did not tell them about the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Police sorry for failure to warn families of Isis girls about schoolfriend's flight|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11415790|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has said that police should not be made "scapegoats" for people joining ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaders: Vigilance crucial or more will be lost to IS|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/leaders-vigilance-crucial-or-more-will-be-lost-to-is-1-3715147|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Scotsman|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said "Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beake|first1=Nick|title=David Cameron concerned over Syria-bound London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32134575|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a travel ban was imposed upon five girls from the Bethnal Green Academy due to concerns from social services that they the girls attend the same school as the three who had already joined the group, stating that it was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Travel ban for five east London girls over fears they will join Isis in Syria|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/27/five-girls-barred-from-travel-same-school-three-teenagers-syria-bethnal-green-academy|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teenagers have not made contact with their families since May 2016. Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant. Sultana is said to have married a western ISIS fighter with Somali heritage, but wanted to return to the UK after he was killed in battle. Shortly afterwards she was killed in a Russian airstrike.&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite news |last=De Peyer|first=Robin|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/families-fear-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-who-travelled-to-join-isis-are-now-dead-a3605096.html|title=Families fear Bethnal Green schoolgirls who travelled to join Isis are now dead|work= |location=London|publisher=''[[London Evening Standard]]''|date=6 August 2017|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sultana's family in a phone interview with ITV in August 2016 said that they believed her to have died in an airstrike in May 2016 at the age of 17 while planning to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henley|first1=Jon|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram|title=Kadiza Sultana: London schoolgirl who joined Isis believed killed in Syria airstrike|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/london-schoolgirl-kadiza-sultana-who-joined-isis-believed-killed-in-syria-airstrike|accessdate=12 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Veselinovic|first1=Milena|last2=McKenzie|first2=Sheena|title=Family fears British girl who went to Syria is dead|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/11/middleeast/uk-isis-missing-girls/|accessdate=12 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer who represents the family of the teenagers Tasnime Akunjee told ITV that she became too scared of making an escape attempt after another girl [[Samra Kesinovic]] was beaten to death for trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Isis jihadi bride Kadiza Sultana 'abandoned efforts to escape Syria after Austrian girl beaten to death'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-latest-syria-british-bride-kadiza-sultana-killed-air-strike-death-gave-up-after-girl-beaten-a7186661.html|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=The Independent|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abase married an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir in July 2016 who was reported by Australian intelligence agencies to have been killed in coalition airstrikes.

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
In [[Christian theology]] and [[ecclesiology]], the '''apostles''' ({{Lang-el|ἀπόστολος|lit=one who is sent away|translit=apóstolos}}), particularly the '''Twelve Apostles''' (also known as the '''Twelve Disciples''' or simply the '''Twelve'''),  were the primary [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus]], the central figure in [[Christianity]]. During the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[ministry of Jesus]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]], the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of [[the gospel]] message of Jesus. The word ''disciple'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''apostle''; for instance, the [[Gospel of John]] makes no distinction between the two terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In modern usage, prominent [[missionaries]] are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the [[Latin]] equivalent of ''apostle'', i.e. ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''missionary''. For example, [[Saint Patrick]] (AD 373–463) was the "Apostle of Ireland", [[Saint Boniface]] (680–755) was the "Apostle to the [[German people|Germans]]", &lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; [[José de Anchieta|Saint José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) was the "Apostle of Brazil" and [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur|Saint Peter of Betancur]] (1626–1667) was the "Apostle of Guatemala".

While [[Christian tradition]] often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different [[Four Evangelists|gospel writers]] give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one [[gospel]] are not mentioned in others. The [[commissioning of the Twelve Apostles]] during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. After his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus sent eleven of them (minus [[Judas Iscariot]], who by then had [[Judas Iscariot#Death|died]]) by the [[Great Commission]] to spread his teachings to all nations.  This event is commonly called the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. There is also an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] tradition derived from the [[Gospel of Luke]] of there having been as many as [[Seventy disciples|70 apostles]] during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in [[early Christianity]], notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.

The period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the [[Apostolic Age]].&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; During the 1st century AD, the apostles established [[Local church|churches]] throughout the territories of the [[Roman Empire]] and, according to tradition, through the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[India]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles by Constantinople master (early 14th c., Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|The [[Synaxis]] of the Twelve Apostles. Russian, 14th century, Moscow Museum.]]

The word "apostle" comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπόστολος}}}} (''apóstolos''), formed from the prefix {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπό-}}}} (''apó-'', "from") and root {{lang|grc|{{linktext|στέλλω}}}} (''stéllō'', "I send", "I depart") and originally meaning "messenger, envoy". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a "delegate".&lt;ref name="Coppieters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bauer lexicon|Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]]'' argues that its Christian use translated a [[Judaism|Jewish]] position known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the ''sheliach'' ({{lang|he|{{linktext|שליח}}}}). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the English "[[missionary]]".

==Background==
In the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have [[Hebrew name]]s, although some have [[Greek name]]s. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.&lt;ref&gt;As was not uncommon for Jews at the time, some of them had two names, one Hebrew/Aramaic and the other Greek. Hence the lists of Jesus' twelve apostles contains 14 names not 12; the 4 [[Greek language|Greek]] names are [[Andrew]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thaddaeus]] and [[Lebbaeus]]. Reference: [[John P. Meier]]'s [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew|''A Marginal Jew'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bibleref2|Mark|6:7–13}} states that Jesus initially sent out these twelve in pairs ([[cf.]] {{Bibleref2|Mt|10:5–42}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk|9:1–6}}) to towns in [[Galilee]]. The text states that their initial instructions were to [[Faith healing|heal the sick]] and [[Exorcism#Jesus|drive out demons]].&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt; They are also instructed to "take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, but to wear sandals, and not put on two [[tunic]]s", and that if any town rejects them they ought to shake the dust off their feet as they leave, a gesture which some scholars think was meant as a contemptuous threat (Miller 26).{{incomplete citation|date= November 2018}} Their carrying of just a staff (Matthew and Luke say not even a staff) is sometimes given as the reason for the use by Christian [[bishop]]s of a [[Crosier|staff of office]] in those denominations that believe they maintain an [[apostolic succession]].

Later in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as [[Great Commission|having been commissioned to preach]] the Gospel to "all the nations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mt|28:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk|13:10}}, and {{Bibleref2-nb|Mk|16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether Jew or Gentile.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:1–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:7–9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:4–8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|10:1–11:18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is "built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone".{{Bibleref2c|Ephesians|2:19–20}}
{{anchor|The twelve apostles}}

Although not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a [[Jews|Jew]] named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Jesus]] and is considered "the apostle of the [[Gentiles]]",{{Bibleref2c|Romans|11:13|9}} for his missions to spread the gospel message after [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|his conversion]]. In his writings, the [[Pauline epistles|epistles]] to Christian churches throughout the [[Levant]], Paul did not restrict the term "apostle" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor [[Barnabas]] as an apostle.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Apostle." Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280290-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted usage appears in the [[Revelation to John]].&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 21:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century AD]], association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as [[apostolic see]]s. Paul's epistles were accepted as [[Development of the New Testament canon|scripture]], and two of the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] gospels were associated with apostles, as were other [[New Testament]] works. Various Christian texts, such as the ''[[Didache]]'' and the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', were attributed to the apostles. [[Bishops]] traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and [[Early centers of Christianity|established churches]] across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by [[apostolic succession]], from the Twelve.&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; Early [[Church Fathers]] who came to be associated with apostles, such as [[Pope Clement I]] with [[St. Peter]], are referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. The [[Apostles' Creed]], popular in the [[Western Christianity|West]], was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.

==The Twelve Apostles==

===Calling by Jesus===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Exhortation to the Apostles (Recommandation aux apôtres) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Exhortation to the Apostles''.]]
{{Main|Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles}}
The three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from [[Temptation of Jesus|being tempted by the devil]].

Despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that  Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of [[John the Baptist]], and started following Jesus as soon as [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus had been baptized]].

Albright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian [[ascetics]].

[[File:De zielenvisserij - Fishing for souls (Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne).jpg|thumb|[[Adriaen van de Venne]]'s ''Fishers of Men''. Oil on panel, 1614]]
Matthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of [[Zebedee]]. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.

This parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.

The Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]], he noticed, while teaching, a [[tax collector]] in his booth. The tax collector,  called Matthew in {{Bibleref2|Matthew |9:9}}, Levi in {{Bibleref2|Mark|2:14}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:27}}, is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as [[villain]]s in Jewish society, and the [[Pharisees]] are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the [[righteous]], but sinners".

===Replacement of Judas===
{{Main article|Saint Matthias}}
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:
{{quote|Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus... For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry... For it is written in the book of Psalms, "Let his habitation be made desolate, Let no one dwell therein", and, "Let another take his office"...&amp;nbsp;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become with us a witness to his resurrection|{{Bibleref2|Acts|1:15–26}}}}

So, between the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension of Christ]] and the day of [[Pentecost]], the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by [[Sortition|casting lots]], a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|16:33}}). The lot fell upon [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#replace-judas |title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul the Apostle in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:
{{quote|For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.|{{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:3–8}}}}

===Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles===
{{Paul}}
{{Main article|Paul the Apostle}}
In his writings, [[Paul the Apostle]], although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an ''apostle'', one "born out of due time" (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1}}, 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his [[Road to Damascus]] vision and given the name "Paul".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1–9}} With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:2}} He referred to himself as the ''apostle of the Gentiles.''{{Bibleref2c|Rom|11:13|9}}

As the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states, "It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt;

Since Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|9:3–19}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|9:26–27}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|22:6–21}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|26:12–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the latter's death and [[resurrection]] (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|9:1||1 Cor. 9:1 "Am I not an apostle?"}}) and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.

James, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the [[Gentiles]] (specifically those not [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) as of equal authority as Peter's to the [[Jew]]s (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul.{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:7–9}} "James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars&amp;nbsp;... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews."{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:9}}

Paul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|15:9||1 Cor. 15:9}} In addition, despite the [[Matthew 10|Little Commission of Matthew 10]], the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as [[Cornelius the Centurion]] is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the [[Great Commission]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Jesus]] is specifically to "all nations".

===Deaths===

Of the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with [[John the Evangelist|John]] surviving into old age. Only the death of [[James, son of Zebedee]] is described in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#james-the-elder|title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:5}} says that Judas Iscariot threw the silver he received for betraying Jesus down in the Temple, then went and hanged himself. {{bibleref2|Acts|1:18}} says that he purchased a field, then "falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out".

According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|author-link1=Edward Gibbon|year=1826|chapter=Chapter XVI.

Harper for Collins &amp; Hanney|page=20|quote=27. In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria the glory of martyrdom was confined to St. Peter, St. Paul and St. James.

===List of the Twelve Apostles as identified by the Bible===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15464 Jesus and the 12 apostles in Domus Galileae.JPG|thumb|Jesus and the 12 apostles in [[Domus Galilaeae]], [[Israel]].]]
Each of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Mark|3:13–19|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:1–4|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|6:12–16|9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:13|9}}) indicate that all the apostles were men. The [[canonical gospels]] and the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the [[Gospel of Luke]] differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists "Judas the son of James" instead of "Thaddeus". (For more information, see [[Jude the Apostle]].) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the [[Gospel of John]] does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to "the Twelve" ({{Bibleref2|John|6:67–71|9}}), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms "apostles" and "disciples" in John.

| [[Andronicus of Pannonia|Andronicus]] and [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] || {{Bibleref2|Rom|16:7}} || Paul states that Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles." This has been traditionally interpreted in one of two ways:
* That Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles," that is, distinguished apostles.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Andronicus and Junia were "well known ''among'' the apostles" meaning "well known ''to'' the apostles"
If the first view is correct then Paul may be referring to a female apostle&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, J. D. and Reed, J. L., ''In Search of Paul'', Harper San Francisco (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116. {{ISBN|978-0-06-051457-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. ''Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend''. Oxford University Press, US. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - the Greek name (Iounian) is in the accusative and could be either Junia (a woman) or Junias (a man)&lt;ref name="CBMW"&gt;CBMW [https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/a-female-apostle/ "A Female Apostle?"], June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Later manuscripts add accents to make it unambiguously Junias, however while "Junia" was a common name, "Junias" was not&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006" /&gt;, and both options are favoured by different Bible translations.

In the second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the apostles.

Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the two views were correct. The second view, in recent years, has been defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel B. Wallace and Michael H. Burer, "Was Junia Really an Apostle?" NTS 47 (2001): 76–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women who followed Jesus===
In Luke (10:38–42), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: "[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salomé]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.

===The Seventy disciples===
{{main|Seventy disciples}}

The "seventy disciples" or "seventy-two disciples" (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the "Seventy Apostles") were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:1–24}}. According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to (Luke 10:1) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521-524; 543-545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''.

Although the [[Gospel of John]] is anonymous,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=215}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Christian tradition historically has attributed it to [[John the Apostle]], son of [[Zebedee]] and one of Jesus' [[Twelve Apostles]]. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving [[Johannine epistles]] that commentators treat the four books,{{sfn|Lindars|1990|p=63}}{{Incomplete short citation}} along with the [[Book of Revelation]], as a single corpus of [[Johannine literature]], albeit not necessarily written by the same author.{{refn|group=Notes|{{harvnb|Harris|2006|p=479}}{{Incomplete short citation}}: "Most scholars believe that the same person wrote all three documents but that he is not to be identified with either the apostle John or the author of the Gospel."}}

The [[Gospel of Mark]] was written anonymously.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63–64}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Early Christian tradition, first attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis]], ascribes it to [[John Mark]], a companion and interpreter of the [[apostle Peter]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=155–56}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Hence its author is often called [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=36}}{{Incomplete short citation}} It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13–14}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

According to Church tradition, [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the [[Gospel of Luke]], though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172, 235}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |title=Suspect's daughter said in 2004 she was the last to see Gina DeJesus |last1=Dissell |first1=Rachel |date=May 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk6Vrz5i?url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |title=Cleveland kidnapping: Son reveals his father padlocked doors to basement because 'we weren't allowed to go there' |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Usborne |first2=David |date=May 8, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508011422/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law".&lt;ref name="3 missing women found"/&gt;

A year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a [[composite sketch]] and description of a male suspect, described as "Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, {{convert|5|ft|10|in}}, {{convert|165|to|185|lb}}, with green eyes, a [[goatee]] and possibly a pencil-thin beard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaine |first=Jon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |title=Ohio abductions: FBI photofit with likeness to suspect Ariel Castro held for seven years as police say he acted alone |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063305/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court records, Castro was {{convert|5|ft|7|in}}, {{convert|179|lb}}; he had brown eyes and a goatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=33093 |title=Printout: FBI releases sketch of Gina DeJesus' alleged kidnapper |date=April 15, 2005 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10882714 |title=FBI had sketch of suspect but missed the connection |date=May 10, 2013 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom".

A [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[grand jury]] returned a [[Indictment|true bill]] of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a [[death penalty]] specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |title=Ariel Castro indicted on aggravated murder, rape, kidnapping charges |last=McCarty |first=James F. |date=June 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907111035/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ohio grand jury indicts man accused of kidnapping Cleveland women |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;dlvrit=992637 |last1=Palmer |first=Kim |date=June 8, 2013 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608025533/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, "it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty". He noted, "We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |title=Ariel Castro's lawyer: Some kidnap charges 'cannot be disputed' |last=Pearce |first=Matt |date=June 12, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615022557/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accused Cleveland kidnapper ruled capable of standing trial |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |date=July 3, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907063712/http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007.

Castro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a [[plea bargain]] which called for consecutive sentences of [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] plus 1,000 years, all without [[parole]].&lt;ref name=usat072613/&gt; Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to [[appeal]], and could not profit in any way due to his crimes.

At the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government.&lt;ref name=pd130801&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |title=Judge sends Ariel Castro to prison for abduction, rape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight (slideshow) |date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045059/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was "a good person" and "not a monster", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had "practiced the art of [[masturbation]]" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that "most" of the sex he had with them "was consensual". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

"'''Brit Pack'''" is a term that has been used to refer to specific groups of young British actors who have achieved success in Hollywood, as well as more generally to the entire group of such actors. According to one article, "every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom."&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/tim-roth/biography/122|title=Tim Roth – Biography|author=TalkTalk web studio|publisher=talktalk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actors at that time.

==1980s Brit Pack==
The journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed [[Gary Oldman]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Spencer Leigh (actor)|Spencer Leigh]], and [[Colin Firth]] for ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] but he was busy filming ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agwlbp.com/facejan.html|title=HugeDomains.com – Agwlbp.com is for Sale (Agwlbp)|publisher=agwlbp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the interview was "The Brit Pack". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors.&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-roth.com/index.php?id=facejul90|title=Tim Roth: Press|publisher=tim-roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of the 1988 magazine [[Film Comment]] stated that '[[Rupert Everett]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' were the leaders of the pack.&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"&gt;[http://www.americancinemapapers.com/files/BRIT_PACK.htm BRIT PACK: A CLUTCH OF ACTORS], Harlan Kennedy, ''American Cinema Papers'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Brit Pack==
In July 1993, an article for ''The Face'' was titled ''The New Brit Pack'', which included [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Jude Law]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]], [[Samuel West]] and [[Rufus Sewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Face Magazine Editors|title=The Face Magazine – Jaye Davidson Cover|url=http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_571877-The-Face-magazine-Jaye-Davidson-cover-July-1993-Volume-2-No-58.html|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other "packs"==
Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, "Brit Pack" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack "aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either".&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Tim Roth]] had both appeared in the ''Tales Out of School'' television series, [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tim Roth]] both appeared in ''[[Meantime (film)|Meantime]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] and [[Bruce Payne]] and Spencer Leigh both appeared in ''[[Smart Money (1986 film)|Smart Money]]''.

==Later uses of the term==
Currently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-britpack--our-new-generation-of-movie-stars-takes-tinseltown-841199.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2008 | title=The Britpack – Our new generation of movie stars takes Tinseltown}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.{{whom| date=November 2017}}

In 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Eddie Redmayne]] and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/best-of-british-tom-hiddleston|title=Best of British|work=ShortList Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/hot-british-men?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1447_64563853#slide-1|title=Hottest British Actors – 10 Best British Actors|author=Rebecca Cope|work=Harper's BAZAAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burgher arms''' are [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] borne by persons of the ''burgher'' social class of [[Europe]] (usually called ''bourgeois'' in English) since the [[Middle Ages]]. By definition, however, the term is alien to [[British heraldry]], which follows other rules.

Although the term ''burgher'' arms refers to the [[bourgeoisie]], it is often extended also to arms of (Protestant) clergy and even to arms of [[peasant]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In several European countries, the use of armorial bearings was restricted to a particular social class, e.g. the use of [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] in [[Coat of arms#United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] in [[Portuguese heraldry|Portugal]] or [[coronets]] in [[Swedish heraldry#Noble arms|Sweden]]. In other countries, every individual, family and community has been free to adopt arms and use it as they please, provided they have not wrongfully assumed the arms of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), {{p.|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Use of coats of arms by burghers and artisans began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of burghers bore a far wider variety of [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] than the arms of nobility like everyday objects, in particular, [[tool]]s. In burgher arms are met sometimes also [[house mark]]s which are not met in arms of nobility. Most widespread burgher heraldry was and still is in [[Switzerland]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. In the Netherlands only a small percentage of the existing arms belong to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Crest-[[coronet]]s in burgher arms are correct only if the arms were granted by a sovereign and the coronet is explicitly mentioned in the grant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. The Art of Heraldry. Tiger Books International, London. 1991, p. 59 {{ISBN|1-85501-154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
== Germany ==
Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “[[Hofpfalzgraf|Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court]]” ({{lang-de|[[:de:Hofpfalzgraf|Hofpfalzgrafen]]}}), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.

The [[tilting helmet]] was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]]: A Guide to Heraldry. Cassell, London 1981, p.161. {{ISBN|0-304-30751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city [[Patricianship|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173"&gt;[[Handbuch der Heraldik: Wappenfibel]]. (19th expanded edition). Edited by Ludwig Biewer. (Degener &amp; Co, Neustadt an der Aisch 1998), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German-Nordic heraldic tradition]], e.g. in [[Swedish heraldry]].

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms [[law of arms|are protected by law]].

== France ==
Burgher arms used to be common in [[France]], but they disappeared in the [[French Revolution]], which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in ''[[Armorial général (of France)|Armorial général]]'' as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 33-36&lt;/ref&gt; In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.

== Portugal ==
Burgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the [[Portuguese nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater: The Complete Book of Heraldry. Lorenz Books 2002, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until 1910.

== Arms of peasants ==
In some regions ([[Normandy]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]) even peasants sometimes bore arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Switzerland]] 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Frisia]] and [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], where farmers had personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173" /&gt; In [[Denmark]] arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]] peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Krag: ''Norsk heraldisk mønstring fra Frederik IV's regjeringstid 1699-1730'', Bind II Bønder, (1942 – 1955) and Allan Tønnesen (ed.): ''Magtens besegling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">'''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena''' ({{lang-el|Κλεοπάτρα Τρύφαινα}}) was an Egyptian Ptolemaic queen. She may be identical with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V]].

There were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena'':

==Tryphaena, daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III==
[[Tryphaena]] was a sister of [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], [[Ptolemy X Alexander I]], [[Cleopatra IV of Egypt|Cleopatra IV]] and [[Cleopatra Selene of Syria|Cleopatra Selene]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|title=Numismatic Evidence for a New Seleucid King: Seleucus (VII) Philometor|author=Brian Kritt|journal=The Celator|volume=16|issue=4|date=April 2002|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103357/http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this ''Tryphaena'' also bore the name ''Cleopatra'', has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]], king of [[Seleucid Empire|Syria]], in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: [[Seleucus VI Epiphanes]], the twin [[Antiochus XI Epiphanes]] and [[Philip I Philadelphus]], [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]], and [[Antiochus XII Dionysus]]. The couple also had a daughter called [[Laodice VII Thea|Laodice]].  Tryphaena was killed in [[Antioch]] (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]], as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Justin | title = Epitoma historiarum Philippicarum Pompei Trogi | pages = 39.2.3, 39.3.4–12 | authorlink = Justin (historian)}}, our only source for these events.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes==
[[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V Tryphaena]] was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena''.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;

==Cleopatra Tryphaena, daughter of Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII Auletes==
She is called ''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena'' by some modern historians&lt;ref name = "Tyldesley" /&gt; and she would have been an older sister of the famous [[Cleopatra VII]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] took control of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], cited by [[Felix Jacoby]], ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'', no. 260 F 2, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] | title = ''Chronicle'' | page = 167 | publisher = Schoene | url = http://www.attalus.org/translate/eusebius1.html#167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Strabo]] | title = Geographica | page = 17.1.11 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A2*.html#1.11 | publisher = University of Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt]], Ptolemy's wife.&lt;ref name= "Tyldesley"&gt;{{citation | last = Tyldesley | first = Joyce | title = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 2006 | page = 200 | isbn = 0-500-05145-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor''', or '''Charles I of Spain''', was the heir of four of Europe's leading royal houses.  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] was the first sole [[List of Spanish monarchs|monarch of Spain]], inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (the [[Catholic Monarchs]]).  From his father, [[Philip I of Castile]], he inherited the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], which came from his paternal grandmother, [[Mary of Burgundy]].  Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he inherited the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands in [[Austria]].  His [[coat of arms]], representing much of the land he inherited, is [[blazon]]ed as follows:

{{cquote|''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV grand-quarterly i and iv great-grand-quarterly 1 and 4 [[gules]] a three towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [[Mortar (masonry)|masoned]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and ajouré [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), 2 and 3 [[argent]] a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] [[Lion (heraldry)#Positions|rampant]] [[purpure]] crowned Or [[List of heraldic charges#Attitude of animals|langued]] and armed gules (for [[Kingdom of León|Leon]]), ii [[Division of the field|per pale]], dexter [[Division of the field|per fess]], in chief Or four [[Pale (heraldry)|pallets]] gules (for [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a [[cross]], [[saltire]], and [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]] of chains linked together Or and a centre point [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister party per pale argent a [[Cross|cross potent]] and four crosslets Or  impaling [[Variation of the field|barry]] of eight gules and argent (for [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]), iii per pale, dexter per fess, in chief Or four pallets gules (for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a cross, saltire, and orle of chains linked together Or and a centre point vert (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister [[Division of the field|per saltire]], 1 and 4 Or four pallets gules, 2 and 3 argent an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle displayed]] sable (for [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]); II and III grand-quarterly, i gules a [[fess]] argent (for [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]), ii azure [[Variation of the field#Semé|semy-de-lis]] Or a [[bordure]] [[Compone|compony]] argent and gules (new [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iii [[Variation of the field|bendy]] of six Or and azure a bordure gules (old [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iv sable a lion rampant Or langued and armed gules (for [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), overall at the fess point of the quarter an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] Or a lion rampant sable armed and langued gules (for [[Counts of Flanders|Flanders]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] argent an eagle displayed gules, armed, beaked, and langued Or (for [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]); enté en point argent a [[pomegranate]] proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and slipped vert (for [[Granada]]).''

The first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns:  that is, the quartered arms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] themselves quartered with the quartered arms of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sicily]]. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Kingdom_of_Naples#Aragonese_and_Spanish_Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], and [[Navarre]].

The second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of [[Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy]], [[County of Burgundy]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], with the escutcheon in the middle showing [[Flanders]] on the left and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] on the right.

The [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] [[pomegranate]] is represented at the bottom between the two.

==The Burgundian Inheritance and the Order of the Golden Fleece==
In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary "the Rich"]], the [[Charles the Bold|last Burgundian duke]]'s only child, had married Charles' grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of [[Duke of Burgundy]] and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the [[Low Countries]] and the [[County of Burgundy|Free County of Burgundy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  They often used the term [[Burgundy (disambiguation)|Burgundy]] to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were lost to the [[France|French Republic]].  Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

{{for|the 2004 film|Deed Poll (film)}}
A '''deed poll''' (plural: '''deeds poll''') is a [[Law|legal]] document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. It is, strictly speaking, not a [[contract]] because it binds only one [[party (law)|party]] and expresses an intention instead of a promise.

==Use for changing name==
{{main|Deed of change of name}}
The most common use is a [[name change]] through a [[deed of change of name]] {{fact|date=July 2014}} (often referred to simply as a ''deed poll''). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to [[fraud|defraud]]. In [[Australia]], prior to 1 November 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.tas.gov.au/bdm/changeofname/deed_poll_searches_(pre-2000)|title=Births Deaths and Marriages : Deed poll searches (pre-2000)|website=www.justice.tas.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.

The UK Government provides a free web-based service to advise individuals on changing name using a deed poll. Several websites have been established that charge for this service, some of which appear to be from government agencies. However, these have no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=Donna|title=Deed poll websites to avoid|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/29/deed-poll-websites-avoid|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Another common use is to [[Partition (law)|partition]] land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out) by a deed poll into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of deed poll is commonly used in [[Hong Kong]].

A deed poll may also be used (in England and Wales) for clergy of the Church of England to relinquish their [[holy orders]].

==Origin of the term==
The term "deed", also known in this context as a "specialty", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, "signed, sealed and delivered", or even merely "executed as a deed") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. "Poll" is an [[Archaism|archaic]] legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an "[[indenture]]", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. "indented", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage [[forgery]]).

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''Eight Great Eminent Officials''' ({{zh|c=八大元老|p=Bā dà yuánlǎo}}), abbreviated as the '''Eight Elders''' ({{zh|c=八老|p=Bā lǎo}}), were a group of elderly members of the [[Communist Party of China]] who held substantial power during the 1980s and 1990s. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called '''The Eight Immortals''' as an [[allusion]] to the Taoist deities commonly known as the [[Eight Immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=William A.|title=Politics in China: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533530-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk80evDTZIYC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in "strongman politics" ==
The politburo system was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] established it to command and control the [[October Revolution]]. It was later adopted by the Chinese communists.  In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, "strongman politics" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called "Eight Elders". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. [[Hua Guofeng]] was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; [[Hu Yaobang]] was removed in 1987; and, [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed in 1989.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (Apr 20, 2012). "Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Descendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as "the [[Princelings]]" or the "Crown Prince Party". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang/&gt; Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heirs of Mao’s Comrades Rise as New Capitalist Nobility|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/immortals-beget-china-capitalism-from-citic-to-godfather-of-golf.html|accessdate=December 28, 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent of them was [[Gong Xian]]. The Eight Masters of Nanjing were:&lt;ref name="Barnhart266"/&gt;

* [[Xie Sun]] (fl. 1679)

==Name==

"[[Jinling]]" was a former name of the city of [[Nanjing]]. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the terms 金陵八家 and 南京八家 are both used, though the former ("Eight Masters of Jinling") is more frequently used than the latter ("Eight Masters of Nanjing"). In [[English language|English]], on the other hand, the term "Eight Masters of Nanjing" is more frequently used than the term "Eight Masters of Jinling".

'''Ethel Wood''' (16 January 1901 – 19 August 2011) was a [[Guernsey]] [[supercentenarian]]. At the age of 110, Wood was the ninth-oldest verified person who died in the United Kingdom following the death of 112-year-old [[Margaret Fish]] on 12 March 2011. Wood was not born in the United Kingdom, since Guernsey is a [[Crown dependencies|crown-dependency]], and legally never part of the Kingdom of England or the the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Biography==

Ethel Wood was born in [[Saint Sampson, Guernsey]]. She was one of five children born to William and Lily Wood. Wood trained as a teacher in London prior to the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Like her siblings, she never married or had children.

She moved to Essex in the 1990s to care for her younger sister, Edith. Wood lived in her own home until breaking her leg during a fall a month before her 110th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/8797400.Ethel__aged_110__says___I_don_t_feel_any_different_/ "Ethel, aged 110, says: "I don't feel any different""], ''Daily Gazette'' ([[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]], Frinton and Walton), 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/essex-amazing-ethel-celebrates-her-110th-birthday-1-776944|title=Essex: ‘Amazing’ Ethel celebrates her 110th birthday|first=By Chris|last=Harris|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethel died suddenly on 19 August 2011, aged 110 years, 215 days in England. If she had lived until December of that year, she would have surpassed the only other supercententenarian from Guernsey, [[Margaret Ann Neve]] (1792–1903).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25993">[[File:Facebook_-_Update_Your_Name_notification.jpg|thumb|right|[[Facebook]]'s [[Facebook features#Notification|notification]] to "update your name"]]

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.  Author admits the article is about his/her personal experience, and it may or may not be completely factual or verifiable}}&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dragonetti| first1=D.| title=Is Facebook easing up on its 'real names' policy—or cracking down? | work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014|url= http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facebook-real-names-cracking-down-transgender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag performer]] Olivia LaGarce started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] titled "Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!"&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forgotten Ten''' ({{lang-ga|An Deichniúr Dearmadta}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/the_forgotten_ten__an_deichni%C3%BAr_dearmadta_part_1|title=The Forgotten Ten An Deichniúr Dearmadta Part 1|work=World News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term applied to ten members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] who were executed in [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]] by British forces following [[court martial|courts martial]] from 1920–21 during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Based upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the [[Consecration|unconsecrated ground]].  The names of the Forgotten Ten are [[Kevin Barry]], [[Patrick Moran (Irish republican)|Patrick Moran]], [[Frank Flood]], [[Thomas Whelan]], [[Thomas Traynor]], [[Patrick Doyle (Irish republican)|Patrick Doyle]], [[Edmond Foley]], Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm A Brief History Of The National Graves Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}, nga.ie; accessed 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for reburial==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]], Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the [[Irish Free State]], which became the State of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the [[National Graves Association]].  Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a [[Celtic cross]] was erected in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] to commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm Source 1. above] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
[[Image:The Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|The grave of nine of the Forgotten Ten in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]
The campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a [[requiem mass]] at [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] and burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', some criticised the event as glorifying militant [[Irish republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland Dublin State Funeral for IRA Men], Guardian.co.uk; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincided with the [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Ardfheis|party conference]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland|title=Dublin state funeral for IRA men|author=Rosie Cowan|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1359518/Ahern-defends-1921-IRA-men's-state-funeral.html Ahern defends 1921 IRA men's state funeral ] 14 Oct 2001 Telegraph.co.uk : Accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On [[O'Connell Street]], a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the focal point of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In his homily during the requiem mass, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Cahal Daly]], a long-time critic of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the IRA campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:

{{quote|
The true inheritors today of the ideals of the men and women of 1916 to 1922 are those who are explicitly and visibly committed to leaving the physical force tradition behind... Surely this state funeral can be an occasion for examination of conscience about the ideals of the men who died, and about our responsibility for translating those ideals into today's realities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD113FF936A25753C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s], New York Times; accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his graveside oration the [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:{{quote|These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence. The country was under tremendous pressure at the time. There was a united effort. Meanwhile, elected by the people, Dáil Éireann was developing, in spite of a war going on. Democracy was being put to work. Independent civic institutions, including the Dáil courts, were beginning to function. Before their deaths, the ten had seen the light of freedom. They understood that Ireland would be free and independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.eircom.net/~dankiely/pressreleases.html PRESS RELEASE: 17 October 2001], eircom.net; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:

*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)

* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

'''Giedroyć''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Giedraitis; [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: Гедройц; [[French language|French]]: Guedroitz) is a Polish surname, originating from the [[Giedroyć family|Giedroyć princely family]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Overview==
The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius ([[Palemonids]]), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it [[Giedraičiai]], and adopted the title Prince of Giedraičiai.

A document issued by Grand Duke [[Vytautas|Vytautas of Lithuania]] in the period 1399–1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraičiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.

The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's "central core") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).&lt;ref&gt;For a full genealogy of those two lines see [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/gotha.htm On-line Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth]] confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as "of the Princes".

Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.

==Armorial bearings==
The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus "as used by his illustrious grandfather" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).

But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.

At the English College of Arms, the arms of [[Michal Giedroyc]] (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

==Notable people==

Early bearers of the Giedroyć name included:

* Blessed [[:pl:Michał Giedroyć|Michał Giedroyć]], pre-dating the lines of Aleksander and Bartłomiej: buried in the church of St Mark in [[Kraków]], where he lived most of his life as a hermit renowned for gifts of prophecy and miracles; died in 1485.
* son of the eponymous Bartłomiej in the Line of Bartłomiej: Mateusz Giedroyć (envoy to [[Ivan the Terrible]] 1551, Grand Ducal Governor of [[Vilnius]], Grand Ducal Marshal, died 1562/3).

The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], specified ten of his [[Sahabah|companions]] who were promised paradise. Those companions named in this hadith are referred to as '''The Ten With Glad Tidings Of Paradise''' ({{lang-ar|العشرة المبشرون بالجنة}}; ''al-`Asharaa al-Mubasharûn bi-l-Janna'').

==The Hadith==

{{Quote|Narrated [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]]:&lt;br&gt;that the Messenger of Allah said: "[[Abu Bakr]] is in Paradise, '[[Umar]] is in Paradise, '[[Uthman]] is in Paradise, '[[Ali]] is in Paradise, [[Talhah]] is in Paradise, [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair]] is in Paradise, '[[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] is in Paradise, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas]] is in Paradise, [[Sa'id ibn Zayd]] is in Paradise, and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah]] is in Paradise."|Collected by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/urn/636260|title=Hadith - Chapters on Virtues - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|author=|date=|website=sunnah.com|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Muslim view==
[[Muslim]]s put different weight on this hadith, the majority of the [[Sunni]]s, viewing it as very favourable whilst the [[Shia|Shiites]] dismmissed it in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
This hadith was narrated in three collections by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood, and [[Ibn Majah]].

The Sunni collection of hadith, called the ''[[Kutub al-Sittah]]'' (six major hadith collections), includes: ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''Sunan Abu Dawood'', ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'', ''Jami` at-Tirmidhi'' and ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]''. ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and ''Sahih Muslim'' are considered the most reliable of these collections.&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, pg. 160 Dar al-Ma’aarif edition; al-Tirmithi, under #3748; al-Tirmithi, Volume 5, Page 605, Hadith 3748; Abu Daoud, #4649 and #4650&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis say that Muhammad's companions were sorted into twelve groups and of these the ten promised paradise were ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html Twelve Ranks of the Companions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423065308/http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html |date=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imperial Standards of Iran''' were the personal official flags of the [[Shāhanshāh]], [[Shahbānū]], and Crown Prince of Iran, adopted at the beginning of 1971.

The official flag of Shāhanshāh consisted of a pale-blue field with the [[flag of Iran]] in the upper left corner and the Pahlavi coat of arms in the centre. At the top of the coat of arms was the Pahlavi crown, created for the Coronation of [[Rezā Shāh of Iran|Rezā Shāh]] in 1926. The Imperial motto of Pahlavi is "''Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast''" ("Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me" or, alternatively, "He gave me power to command, and He is the judge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|title=Iranian Empire (Pahlavi dynasty): Imperial standards|accessdate=2007-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412122220/http://fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|archivedate=2007-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pale blue]] was the colour of the Imperial Family. The uniforms of the Imperial Guard included this colour to show their allegiance.

The '''Irvine''' family were agricultural pioneers and prominent [[landowner]]s in California who gave their name to the city of [[Irvine, California]].

==James Irvine I==
'''James Irvine''' (1827–1886) was born in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] on December 27, 1827, the second to the youngest of nine children. When [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Ireland's potato crop failed]] in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the [[United States]]. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]], or [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]. Irvine worked for two years in [[New York City]]. In 1848 Irvine went to join the [[California Gold Rush]] as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a [[San Francisco]] commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed "Irvine &amp; Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture [[Flint, Bixby &amp; Company]] of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin [[Bixby land companies|Llewellyn Bixby]]. The purchase of the {{convert|48800|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Joaquin]] in 1864 and the {{convert|47200|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]] in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent [[Cleveland, Ohio]], educator, writer, poet and State Senator [[Harvey Rice]], who was a direct descendant of [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt5779q2gb&amp;chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&amp;brand=oac Guide to the Rice Family Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Notables Of The West V2: Being The Portraits And Biographies Of The Progressive Men Of The West'', 1915, by International News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine II==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Sr.''' (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and [[Harvey Rice|Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice]], was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Blue&gt;[[Thomas William Herringshaw|Herringshaw, Thomas William]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kykEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 ''American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook'', p. 293.] American Blue Book Publishers, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the [[Irvine Company]]. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, "Jase", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, Robert Glass. The Irvine Ranch of Orange County: 1810-1950. San Marino, Calif.: The Huntington Library, 1952, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; James II lived in San Francisco until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street.&lt;ref name=Blue/&gt; He established the [[James Irvine Foundation]] in 1937, an entity dedicated to the "general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California." James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The city of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of [[Bright's disease]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/sfbirvi.htm James Irvine II]&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine III==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Jr.''' (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928.

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

==Early life==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her [[Double cousin|double second cousin]], Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck&gt;{{cite web | title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity – Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life| url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm| publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]]| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop ''Grands Magasins de Nouveautés'', where she lived until the age of 110.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]], and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s, but disliked killing birds.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher= Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the Russian imperial family]], a view shared by many fellow centenarians.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter12&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

Their only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Yvonne died from [[pneumonia]], after which Calment raised Frédéric herself.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | title = World's oldest person dies at 122| url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/04/obit.oldest/| publisher=CNN| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]
In 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a [[life estate]].&lt;ref name=LifeLease&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html |title=A 120-Year Lease on Life Outlasts Apartment Heir |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 [[French franc|francs]] (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LifeLease/&gt; Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;  During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she "competed with [[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=From an interview made in 1989 |publisher=Boutique.ina.fr |date=21 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop,&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccook&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C3313956| title=World's oldest person dead| date=4 August 1997| work=McCook Daily Gazette| page=1| accessdate=5 May 2011| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought some canvas, later describing him as "ugly" (''laid''), "blighted by [[Alcoholism#Signs and symptoms|alcohol]]" (''brûlé par l'alcool''), and visiting [[Prostitution in France|brothels]] (''il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance'').&lt;ref name=YouTube1994/&gt;

After her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of [[Florence Knapp (supercentenarian)|Florence Knapp]] on 11 January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 '''1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time'']; Guinness World Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to [[Carrie C. White]] of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research.&lt;ref name=SunJournal&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronda| last = Addy| title = Life Expectancy| url = http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 1 February 2009| work = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)| Sun Journal]]| date = 25 May 2008| accessdate = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see [[Longevity claims]] and [[Longevity myths]]).

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically. In Calment's youth each French town had its own solar time. In 1891 the introduction of railways motivated a unified French time zone in line with Greenwich Time in Britain. In 1940 the invading Germans changed the French time by one hour to German time, to which France still adheres as of 2016.}} In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Allard1998Englishchapter2" /&gt; 

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]]. At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including [[fencing]], cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]] ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s.&lt;ref name="Garoyan1990ThesisPart1"/&gt; Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion.

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter.

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

'''Jemeker Thompson-Hairston''' is a criminal who rose to the top of the cocaine trade during the peak of the 1980s crack epidemic in Los Angeles.

Her memoir, ''Queen Pin'', co-written with [[David Ritz]], was published in 2010.&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;"[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jemeker-thompson-hairston/queen-pin/ QUEEN PIN: A Memoir by Jemeker Thompson-Hairston and David Ritz]", Kirkus Reviews, June 22nd, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. In a mixed review, [[Kirkus Reviews]] said that it "lacks the salacious elements that make criminal memoirs compelling," but noted that it "may appeal to believers" due to its religious content.&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; Thompson-Hairston was also the subject of an episode in the second season of the [[Netflix]] series ''Drug Lords''.&lt;ref&gt;Flare, "[https://www.macleans.ca/culture/netflix-canada-in-july-2018-whats-coming-and-going-this-month/ Netflix Canada in July 2018: what’s coming (and going) this month]", Macleans, June 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000). She Captains : Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ching Shih]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of China, famous for commanding over 300 ships and an army of 20,000 to 40,000 pirates. She lived during the 18th and 19th centuries.
*[[Gráinne O'Malley]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of Ireland. She lived during the 16th century.
*[[Muirisc]], daughter of [[Úgaine Mór]] (Hugony the Great), the sixty-sixth high king of Ireland, c. 600 BC  to AD 500.

==Africa==

===Angola===
*[[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba]]  valiantly fought and held off [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control of present-day [[Angola]] for over thirty years during the early 17th century.

===Benin history===

* The [[Dahomey Amazons]] (or ''N'Nonmiton'', meaning ''our mothers'' in the [[Fon language]]), were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment in [[Dahomey]], an African kingdom (c. 1600–1894) located in the area of the present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the semi-mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

===Berber history===
*[[Kahina]] or '''al-Kāhina''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a 7th-century female [[Berber people|Berber]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to Arab expansion in [[Northwest Africa]], the region then known as [[Numidia]], known as the [[Maghreb]] today. She was born in the early 7th century and died around the end of the 7th century probably in modern-day [[Algeria]].

===Burkina Faso===
*[[Yennenga]] was a legendary warrior woman skilled in spear and bow, considered by the [[Mossi people]] as the mother of their empire.

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The warrior goddess [[Sekhmet]], shown with her sun disk and cobra crown]]
*[[Ankt]] may have originated in [[Asia Minor]]. Within [[Egypt]] she was later syncretized as [[Neith]] (who by that time had developed aspects of a war goddess).
*[[Cleopatra VII]] was a [[Hellenistic]] co-ruler of Egypt with her father ([[Ptolemy XII of Egypt|Ptolemy XII Auletes]]) and later with her brothers/husbands [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt|Ptolemy XIII]] and [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]]. Her patron goddess was [[Isis]], and thus during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom.
*[[Sekhmet]] is a warrior goddess depicted as a [[lion]]ess, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians.
*Though her reign was primarily peaceful, the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] fought in several battles during her younger years.
*[[Nefertiti]], wife of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], has been at times depicted as smiting enemies in a manner similar to how a male ruler typically would.
*[[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]], wife of [[Seqenenre Tao II]], was believed to have been in command of the army while her son Ahmose I was still young.

===Ethiopia===
*[[Gudit]] (Ge'ez: Yodit, Judith) is a semi-legendary, non-Christian, [[Beta Israel]], queen (flourished c.960) who laid waste to [[Aksum]] and its countryside, destroyed churches and monuments, and attempted to exterminate the members of the ruling Axumite dynasty. Her deeds are recorded in the oral tradition and mentioned incidentally in various historical accounts.

===Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]])===
*[[Yaa Asantewaa]] was the Queen Mother of Ejisu ([[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] Confederacy)—now part of modern-day [[Ghana]]. In 1900 she led the Ashanti rebellion known as the [[War of the Golden Stool]] against British colonialism.

===Hausa history===

The end result was that he became a better warrior.

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

*Rani Velu Nachiyar (Tamil: இராணி வேலு நாச்சியார்) was an 18th-century Indian Queen from Sivaganga. Rani Velu Nachiyar was the first Queen to fight against the British in India, even preceding the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. She was the princess of Ramanathapuram and the daughter of Chellamuthu Sethupathy. She married the king of Siva Gangai and they had a daughter - Vellachi Nachiar. When her husband Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar was killed, she was drawn into battle. Her husband and his second wife were killed by a few British soldiers and the son of the Nawab of Arcot. She escaped with her daughter, lived under the protection of Hyder Ali at Virupachi near Dindigul for eight years. During this period, she formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British. In 1780, Rani Velu Nachiyar fought the British with military assistance from Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali and won the battle. When Velu Nachiyar finds the place where the British stock their ammunition, she builds the first human bomb. A faithful follower, Kuyili douses herself in oil, lights herself and walks into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named “udaiyaal” in honour of her adopted daughter — Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal. Nachiar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom and ruled it for 10 more years.

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E. Vanderwerker, Jr., M.D. JACPOC 1976 Vol 15, Num 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">The '''Masters of Dirc van Delf''' were a group of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript painters]] active in the [[Netherlands]] between 1400 and around 1410. The name has been appended to several unknown artists who together make up an important [[studio]] of illuminators, one of the first important ones known from fifteenth-century Holland. Their name is derived from the lavish work they did to illustrate devotional texts by [[Dirc van Delf]], court chaplain to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht of Bavaria]] from 1389 until 1404 in [[The Hague]]. The studio's artists combined with Dirc to play an important role in the new cultural life of the royal court in the Netherlands.

Paintings by the Masters may be found in the collections of the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

The '''Muan''', '''Moan''' or '''Mohan''' (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as '''Poira''' is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in [[South America|South]] and [[Latin American folklore|Central American folklore]]. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for [[shaman]]s or [[witch doctor]]s in some [[Colombia]]n indigenous cultures (such as the [[:es:Panche|Panche]]s).
[[File:Mohan pijao.JPG|thumb|right|Un muñeco de Mohán.]]
==History==
Various different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a [[satyr]]-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a "big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown."&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botero|first=Alvaro|title=La fábula y el desastre: estudios críticos sobre la novela colombiana, 1650-1931|year=1999|publisher=Fondo Editorial Universidad EAFIT|location=Medellín|isbn=958-9041-27-2|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_f%C3%A1bula_y_el_desastre.html?id=yqXq2rVoA0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people. He also causes mischief for young girls who come to wash clothes in the water.&lt;ref name="Uribe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Uribe|first=Juana|title=Realidad mágica a la orilla del río|url=http://admin.banrepcultural.org/node/124056|work=Biblioteca Virtual|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohan is also known as an avatar whose form shamans are able to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolmatoff|first=Gerardo|title=Goldwork and Shamanism: an iconographic study of the Gold Museum of the Banco de la República, Colombia{{!}}|year=2005|publisher=Villegas Editores|location=Bogotá|isbn=9588156610|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9588156610}}&lt;/ref&gt; One myth tells of how a shaman became an alligator in order to be close to the girls who played in the river. The shaman was not able to fully transform back into a human, and became an alligator with a human head.&lt;ref name="Uribe"/&gt; The Poira, whose name is interchangeable with the Mohan, is described by others as an Indian warlock who lives on the [[:es:Cerro del Pacandé|Cerro del Pacandé]] in Tolima, Colombia.&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"/&gt; The Poira is also believed to be a small, naked invisible boy or adult who can also appear formless or as a black bear.&lt;ref name="American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=John|title=American Elves: An Encyclopedia of Little People from the Lore of 380 Ethnic Groups of the Western Hemisphere|year=1997|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub|isbn=0899509444|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mononymous person''' is an individual who is known and addressed by a single name, or mononym.{{efn|From the [[Greek language|Greek]] μόνος, ''mónos'' ("single"), and ὄνομα, ''ónoma'' ("name"). [[Noun]]: "mononym"; [[adverb]]: "mononymously"; [[verb]]: "mononymize"; [[abstract noun]]: "mononymity".&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0503|title=mononym|date=2003-05-06|publisher=A Word a Day|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"[[Mononym]]" is defined in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1989, volume IX, p. 1023) as "A term consisting of one word only […] Hence ''mononymic'' […] a[djective], consisting of a mononym or mononyms; ''mononymy'' […], a mononymic system; ''mononymize'' v[erb], to convert into a mononym; whence ''mononymization''."  The term is attested in the English language as early as 1872.}} In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a [[:Wiktionary:polynym|polynym]] ("multiple name"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country{{efn|For example, [[Javanese name]]s traditionally are mononymic.}} or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.

== Antiquity ==
[[File:King Narmer.jpg|thumb|Narmer]]

The structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some societies, individuals have been mononymous, receiving only a single name. [[Alulim]], first king of [[Sumer]], is one of the earliest names known; [[Narmer]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]], is another. In addition, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] names also follow the pattern, with [[epithet]]s (similar to second names) only used subsequently by historians to avoid confusion, as in the case of [[Zeno the Stoic]] and [[Zeno of Elea]]; likewise, [[patronymic]]s or other biographic details (such as [[Polis|city]] of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but these details were not considered part of the name.

A departure from this custom occurred, for example, among the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who by the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period [[Tria nomina|used multiple names]]: a male citizen's name comprised three parts (this was mostly typical of the upper class, while others would usually have only two names): ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name), ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' (clan name) and ''[[cognomen]]'' (family line within the clan)&amp;nbsp;— the ''nomen'' and ''cognomen'' were almost always hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''Dictionary of the Bible'', p. 2060.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononyms in other ancient cultures include the [[Celts|Celtic]] queen [[Boudica]] and the [[Numidia]]n king [[Jugurtha]]. However, the historical records of some of these figures are scanty or rely completely on the documentation of those outside the person's culture, so it is possible such figures may have had other names within their own cultures that have since been lost to history.

==Medieval uses==

===Europe===
During the [[early Middle Ages]], mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is [[Edeko]], the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] chieftain whose son ruled Italy as [[Flavius Odoacer]]. By the end of the period, surnames had become commonplace: [[Edmund Ironside]], for example, ruled England (although Ironside was an epithet added later in life), [[Brian Boru]] was [[High King of Ireland]], [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] had united Scotland, and even in [[Scandinavia]] surnames were taking hold. The [[Dutch Renaissance]] scholar and theologian [[Erasmus]] is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as "Desiderius Erasmus" or "Erasmus of Rotterdam", he was christened only as "Erasmus", after the [[martyr]] [[Erasmus of Formiae]].

===The Americas===
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas]]

Between Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most{{cn|date=January 2017}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were mononymous. Examples include [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]] (Mexico, 1398–1469), [[Anacaona]] (Haiti, 1464–1504), [[Agüeybaná I|Agüeybaná]] (Puerto Rico, died 1510), [[Diriangen]] (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), [[Urracá]] (Panama, died 1531), [[Guamá]] (Cuba, died 1532), [[Atahualpa]] (Peru, 1497–1533), [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (Honduras, died 1537), [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]] (Chile, 1534–1557), [[Tamanaco]] (Venezuela, died 1573), [[Pocahontas]] (United States, 1595–1617), [[Auoindaon]] (Canada, fl. 1623), [[Cangapol]] (Argentina, fl. 1735), and [[Tecumseh]] (United States, 1768–1813). 

Uniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat [[Cornplanter]] received both a [[Seneca language|Seneca-language]] mononym (Kaintwakon, roughly "corn-planter") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life.  His later descendants, such as [[Jesse Cornplanter]], used "Cornplanter" as the family name instead of "Abeel". 

In the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the [[Apache Wars]] had mononym birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: [[Geronimo]] (born Goyaałé), [[Victorio]] (born Beduiat), [[Cochise]], and so on.

==Post-medieval uses==
Since the medieval period, mononyms in the West have almost exclusively been used to identify people who already had surnames. These [[nickname]]s were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.

===France===
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|Molière]]

Some French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym [[stage name]] [[Molière]].

In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet adopted the mononym [[Voltaire]], for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' [[Bastille]], to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an [[anagram]] for a [[Latin]]ized version of his family [[surname]], "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family ''[[château]]'', Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as "voltige", "volte-face" and "volatile". "Arouet" would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with "[[Breaking wheel#Metaphorical uses|roué]]" and with an expression that meant "for thrashing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Sidetracks'', pp. 345–66; and "Voltaire's Grin", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 30, 1955, pp. 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century French author [[Marie-Henri Beyle]] used many [[pen name]]s, most famously the mononym Stendhal, adapted from the name of the little [[Prussia]]n town of [[Stendal]], birthplace of the German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], whom Stendhal admired.&lt;ref&gt;F.W.J. Hemmings, "Stendhal", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 25, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, a fourth French writer, [[Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette]] (author of ''[[Gigi]]'', 1945), used her actual surname as her mononym pen name, Colette.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Marks, "Colette", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 7, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French actors and singers have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.

===Other Europe===
[[File:Franz Gareis - Novalis.jpg|thumb|Novalis]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian [[castrato]] singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]], [[Farinelli]]). The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as [[Novalis]]. 

The 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name [[Multatuli]] (from the [[Latin]] ''multa tuli'', "I have suffered [or ''borne''] many things"), became famous for the satirical novel, ''Max Havelaar'' (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of [[colonialism]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. 

The Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882–1961) wrote under the pseudonym [[Nescio]] (Latin for "I don't know").

The 20th-century British author [[Hector Hugh Munro]] became known by his [[pen name]], Saki. In 20th-century Poland, the [[theater of the absurd|theater-of-the-absurd]] [[playwright]], novelist, [[Painting|painter]], photographer and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Twentieth century|philosopher]] [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym Witkacy, a [[conflation#Language|conflation]] of his surname (''Witkiewicz'') and [[middle name]] (''Ignacy'').&lt;ref&gt;"[[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy]]", ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 747–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of visual artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]], are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist [[Erté]] formed his mononymous [[pseudonym]] from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers [[Hergé]] and [[Jijé]].

Italian painter [[Bernardo Bellotto]], who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal ([[Canaletto]]), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise "Canaletto". Bellotto remains commonly known as "Canaletto" in those countries to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto, Bernardo]]", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononymity was represented in [[photography]], from that art's infancy, by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon).

===North America===
The American writer of non-fiction and fiction, [[Rodney William Whitaker]] (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym [[pen name]], Trevanian. The Armenian-Canadian [[portrait photographer]] [[Yousuf Karsh]] was commonly known as "Karsh of [[Ottawa]]".

==Royalty==
[[File:Emperor Akihito cropped Akihito 090710-1600b.jpg|thumb|[[Akihito]], [[Emperor of Japan]]]]

[[Monarch]]s and other [[Royal family|royalty]], for example [[Napoleon]], have traditionally availed themselves of the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an [[regnal number|ordinal]] or [[epithet]] (e.g., Queen [[Elizabeth II]] or [[Charles the Great]]). This is not always the case: King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported [[Personal names#Feudal names|long chains]] of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use [[surname]]s.{{efn|The names of a few European kings ''have'' included surname&amp;nbsp;— for example, those of most of Poland's [[Monarchs of Poland|elected kings]], such as [[Stefan Batory|Stefan ''Batory'']].&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Báthory", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as [[Hirohito]], which in practice in Japanese is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War: Imperial Tradition and Military Decision-Making in Prewar Japan'', preface, University of Hawaii Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8248-1166-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an Emperor's death or retirement, he is renamed according to the era of his reign. In India, the first six [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.

[[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s have traditionally adopted a single, [[regnal name]] upon their [[List of papal elections|election]] (except for [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II|II]]). The mononymous tradition reverted to form with the election and succession of Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in 2005 and [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.

==Modern times==

===Mononym-normal===
The Western practice of combining a given name (Christian name or [[given name|forename]]) with a family name ([[surname]]) is not universal.

Surnames were introduced in [[Turkey]] only after [[World War I]], by that country's first president, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], as part of his westernizing and modernizing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Siwmir, "''Nieziemska ziemia''" ("An Unearthly Land"), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'' [The Pole Star]: ''America's oldest independent Polish-language newspaper'', Stevens Point, Wisconsin, vol. 100, no 18, August 29, 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means "Father Turk". Common people can be addressed semi-formally by their given name plus the title [[Bey]] or [[Khanum|Hanım]] (without surname), whereas politicians are often known by surname only ([[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Süleyman Demirel|Demirel]]). Many Turkish sportspeople, especially football players, wear jerseys with only their first name.

Mononyms are also common in Indonesia for [[Javanese name|Javanese individual]]s, both prominent government figures such as former presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] and commoners such as [[Triyatno]].

Most Icelanders do not have surnames, only [[patronymics]] (sometimes [[matronymic]]s), and they address each other by given name, even in formal situations.

===Asia===
In modern times, in countries that have long been part of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] (Japan, [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and China itself), mononyms are rare. An exception pertains to the [[Emperor of Japan]] (a common opinion being that there is no state{{huh|date=September 2018}} to give the [[Japanese name|family name]] ({{lang|ja|苗字}}) to the Emperor). 

Mononyms are common as [[stage name]]s in the [[entertainment industry]], usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., [[Ayaka]], [[Becky (television personality)|Becky]], [[Gackt]], [[Hide (musician)|hide]], [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]], [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]], [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], [[Miyavi]], [[Tsunku]], and [[Yui (singer)|Yui]]. Also, Japanese baseball star [[Ichiro Suzuki]] is widely known in both Japan and North America as "Ichiro". In [[Hong Kong]], a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., [[Janice Vidal|Janice]],&lt;ref name="CDbook"&gt;All Janice Vidal albums are credited mononymously as "Janice".{{Cite book

Mononyms continue to be used in parts of India, especially the South. [[Mayawati]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as [[Asin]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Rekha]], [[Kajol]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajnikanth]], and [[Pran (actor)|Pran]],  are also mononymous. [[Govindjee]], Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an Indian-American and an authority on photosynthesis, publishes his research under his singular name. In the northeastern India state of Mizoram, most people have a single name, mostly of three syllables (e.g., Lalthansanga, Thangrikhuma, Zorinmawia).  Everyone also has a tribal or clan name inherited from their father, but they do not include it in their official name.

Mononyms are also common in [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Javanese name]]s. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]], the mononym is the full legal name. Other mononyms, such as [[Rossa (singer)|Rossa]], [[Chrisye]] and [[Tohpati]], are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name.

Single names still also occur in [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4607454.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tibets most famous woman blogger Woeser detained by police | first=Jane | last=MacArtney | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mongolia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Most [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] have no [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Public Radio]] report of 18 May 2009 about civilian Afghan victims of U.S. [[Drone aircraft|drone-aircraft]] bombings in the U.S.-[[Taliban]] war.

In [[Thailand]], people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames ({{lang-th|ชึ่อเล่น|translit=chue-len}}). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like "Nok" for "Noknoi" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the [[Thai royal family|royal family]], and they are freely used in everyday life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mononyms are common in [[Myanmar]]. [[U Thant]], a Myanmar diplomat, was the third [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] (1961–71).  "U" is an honorific in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], roughly equal to "Mr". "''Thant''" was his only name, per local convention. In Myanmar, he was known as ''Pantanaw U Thant'', in reference to his hometown, [[Pantanaw]].

In the [[Near East]]'s [[Arab]] world, the Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said Esber (born 1930) at age 17 adopted the mononym pseudonym, [[Adunis]], sometimes also spelled "Adonis".  A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, he has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012|quote=each autumn is credibly tipped for the Nobel in literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West===
In the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of [[celebrity|famous]] persons such as prominent writers, [[artist]]s, [[entertainer]]s, musicians and [[athlete]]s.{{efn|"A mononym is a name consisting of a single word. They are generally favored by celebrities of sufficient stature to be identified in this way, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Pelé]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mononym] "Mononym", on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|A [[Paris Hilton]] [[lookalike]], [[Chantelle Houghton]], nicknamed "[[Paris Travelodge]]", became famous "for not being famous" after winning an extraordinary ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Lucy Rock writes: "It is a select band. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]], [[Pelé]], [[Thalía]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]... even, possibly, [[Katie Price|Jordan]].&lt;!--She now uses her real name.--&gt; People who wear their fame with such confidence that they have dispensed with the... concerns of having more than one name. They are the '''mononym brigade'''. Now there is one more.... Chantelle is... the apotheosis of that celebrity narrative that first gave us people who were famous for being good at something. Then came the people who were famous for simply... being famous. Now there is Chantelle, who is famous for not being famous at all."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Rock, "From Nobody Much to Someone Special", ''[[The Observer]]'', January 29, 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/29/broadcasting.bigbrother]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some persons, such as the artists [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]] and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]], the sculptor [[Chryssa]], and the singer-songwriter [[Basia]], have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of [[self-identification]], and so have used only a single part of their full names.

The case of the Icelandic musician [[Björk]] is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she [[Icelandic name|has no family name]]; the second part of her full name is a patronymic.  In her case, ''Björk Guðmundsdóttir'' literally translates to "''Björk, Guðmund's daughter''". Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.

Some mononym stage names are the performer's [[given name]] (e.g., [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Zendaya]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Selena]], [[Cher]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]]) while others may be the performer's [[middle name]] (e.g., [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), or [[surname]] (e.g. [[Liberace]], [[Mantovani]], [[Morrissey]]). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g.  [[Eminem]], [[P!nk]], [[Lorde]]), adopted words (e.g. [[Capucine]], French for "[[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]]") or nicknames (e.g., [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bono]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]).

In [[Lusophone]] countries such as [[Portugal]], [[Cape Verde]] and especially [[Brazil]], football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. [[Pelé]], [[Nani]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Eusébio]], [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]]&lt;!-- four examples (2 x nicknames + 2 x given names) is plenty - please discuss on the talk page before changing the examples used - thanks --&gt;). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include the player's first name ([[Xavi]], [[Sergi Barjuán|Sergi]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]), derivations of the player's surname ([[Ferran Corominas|Coro]], [[Guti (footballer)|Guti]]), derivations of the player's first name ([[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Kiko (Spanish footballer)|Kiko]]), diminutives ([[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]], [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]]), and nicknames ([[Míchel (footballer)|Michel]], [[Arteaga (footballer)|Arteaga]], [[Arzu (footballer)|Arzu]]). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the [[Venezuela]]n [[Miku (footballer)|Miku]], the [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] [[Gervinho]] and the [[Serbia]]n-born [[United States|American]] [[Preki]]. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players [[Hortência Marcari|Hortência]] and [[Nenê]].

Also in Brazil, former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] is known as "Lula", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in [[given name]]s, [[surname]]s or [[nickname]]s, are used because [[Portuguese names]] tend to be rather long.

The [[comedian]] and [[illusionist]] [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], the silent half of the duo [[Penn &amp; Teller]], has legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym "Teller" and possesses a [[United States passport]] issued in that single name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/home/2007-11-15-teller-at-home_N.htm|title=At home: Teller's magical Vegas retreat speaks volumes|work=[[USA Today]]|author=della Cava, Marco R.|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/12/penn-and-teller-gerard-bakardy-rose-shadows-trick/|title=Penn &amp; Teller: Rogue Magician Is EXPOSING Our Secrets!!!|publisher=[[TMZ.com]]|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional wrestler [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]] (born James Hellwig) legally changed his name to the mononym "Warrior" in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. [[Chyna]] did likewise when the [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|now-WWE]] attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed it back to her birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.

Some have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness.  Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. [[Oprah Winfrey]], famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. The public has referred to President [[George W. Bush]] by the mononym "Dubya" ([[eye dialect]] of "W"), to distinguish from his father, President [[George H.W. Bush|George (H.W.) Bush]].

Both mechanisms contributed in the case of [[Hillary Clinton]], who has been called, and has publicly called herself, "Hillary". [[Peter Funt]], of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', wrote in a February 21, 2007 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece, "The Mononym Platform": "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when [[Dwight Eisenhower|Ike's]] P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker. ... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/opinion/21funt.html The Mononym Platform] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in [[Salon.com]], the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as "Hillary" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/18/hillary_interview|title=Hillary's hard-won experience
|author=Walter Shapiro|publisher=Salon.com|date=Jun 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mononyms also exist in modern popular culture. For instance, some characters on the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' are referred to only by their last names as a mononym, most prominently: [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]], played by [[Michael Richards]], and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], played by [[Wayne Knight]]. Newman's name is clearly a true mononym, in that his first name (or possibly last name) is never used or even revealed. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, is revealed to the other characters and the audience, and so his name could be seen as less of a mononym. However, this does not occur until the show's sixth season, and after the revelation he is still referred to as Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Switch (Seinfeld)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Additionally, on the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] television sitcom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']], the character Wilson, played by [[Earl Hindman]], a next-door neighbor of the central characters, is only referred to as Wilson. His full name, Wilson Wilson, is not revealed until the fourth season.

The '''musicians of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]''' all perished when the ship sank in 1912. They played music, intending to calm the passengers, for as long as they possibly could, and all went down with the ship. All were recognized for their heroism.

==Timeline==
The ship's eight musicians - members of a three-piece ensemble and a five-piece ensemble - were booked through [[C.W. &amp; F.N. Black]], in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Band That Played On: The Extraordinary Story of the 8 Musicians Who Went Down with the Titanic|
author= Turner, Steve |date=2011|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=9781595552198|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9651636-the-band-that-played-on}}&lt;/ref&gt; They boarded at [[Southampton]] and traveled as second-class passengers.  They were not on the [[White Star Line]]'s payroll but were contracted to White Star by the Liverpool firm of C.W. &amp; F.N. Black, who placed musicians on almost all British liners. Until the night of the sinking, the players performed as two separate groups: a [[quintet]] led by violinist and official bandleader [[Wallace Hartley]], that played at teatime, after-dinner concerts, and Sunday services, among other occasions; and the violin, cello, and piano trio of [[Georges Alexandré Krins|Georges Krins]], [[Roger Marie Bricoux|Roger Bricoux]], and [[Theodore Ronald Brailey|Theodore Brailey]], that played at the À La Carte Restaurant and the Café Parisien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_band.shtml/ |title=Titanic's Band or Orchestra|website=Titanic-Titanic.com| accessdate=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Titanic'' hit an iceberg and began to sink, Hartley and his fellow band members started playing music to help keep the passengers calm as the crew loaded the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s. Many of the survivors said that Hartley and the band continued to play until the very end. One second-class passenger said: {{quotation|Many brave things were done that night, but none were more brave than those done by men playing minute after minute as the ship settled quietly lower and lower in the sea. The music they played served alike as their own immortal requiem and their right to be recalled on the scrolls of undying fame.&lt;ref name="Valiant Musicians"/&gt;}}

He boarded the ''Titanic'' on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in [[Southampton]], UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of [[Wallace Hartley]]'s orchestra. His cabin was in the second class quarters.

Hume and the other members of [[Wallace Hartley]]'s orchestra all belonged to the Amalgamated British Musicians Union and were employed by a [[Liverpool]] music agency, C.W. and F.N.

'''Georges Alexandre Krins''' (18 March 1889 – 15 April 1912) was a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] [[violin]]ist on the {{RMS|Titanic}} on its maiden voyage.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Titanica 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/georges-krins.html |title=Mr Georges Alexandre Krins &amp;#124; Encyclopedia Titanica |last=Encyclopedia Titanica|work=encyclopedia-titanica.org |year=2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the disaster.

Georges Alexandre Krins was born on 18 March 1889 in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref name="Titanic-Titanic"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_memorial-george_krins.shtml |title=Titanic Memorial - George Krins, Spa, Belgium |last=Titanic-Titanic.com|work=titanic-titanic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was from [[Belgium]], and soon after his birth they moved back there to the town of [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]]. He first studied at Academie de Musique de Spa. He then moved to the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in [[Liège]], Belgium, where he studied from 30 October 1902 until 1908, when he won first prize for [[violin]], with the highest distinction.&lt;ref name="The Brave Bandsmen

As a young man he wanted to join the army; however, his parents persuaded him otherwise.&lt;ref name="Titanica"/&gt; He worked in his father's shop and played in La Grande Symphonie, [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]].&lt;ref name="Titanica"/&gt; In 1910, he moved to [[Paris]] to be first violin at [[Le Trianon Lyrique]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Titanica 2011"/&gt;  He subsequently moved to London and played for two years at the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] until March 1912.&lt;ref name="Titanica"/&gt; He lived at 10 Villa Road, [[Brixton]], London and became bandmaster of the Trio String Orchestra, which played near the Café Français.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Titanica 2011"/&gt;  This led to his being recruited by CW &amp; FN Black, [[Liverpool]] to play on the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref name="Valiant Musicians"/&gt;

He boarded the ''Titanic'' on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in [[Southampton]], UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of [[Wallace Hartley]]'s orchestra.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Titanica 2011"/&gt;  His cabin was second class, and he was the only Belgian musician aboard the ''Titanic''. After the ''Titanic'' hit an iceberg and began to sink, Krins and his fellow band members assembled in the first class lounge and started playing music to help keep the passengers calm. They later moved to the forward half of the boat deck, where they continued to play as the crew loaded the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s. Krins was 23 years old when he died. His body was never recovered.&lt;ref name="Valiant Musicians"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Titanica 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passenger 47"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hostmybb.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=26167&amp;sid=05a5d5d60b39bf2cb03681fcf29898f8&amp;mforum=httpwwwjohntita |title=TITANIC 4 YOU CHAT FORUMS :: View topic - The Titanic's Band / Orchestra |first= |last=Passenger 47 |website=hostmybb.com |year=2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222139/http://www.hostmybb.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=26167&amp;sid=05a5d5d60b39bf2cb03681fcf29898f8&amp;mforum=httpwwwjohntita |archive-date=10 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

==History==
[[General Francisco del Castillo]], a close associate of [[Andres Bonifacio]]. This Aklanon Katipunero was tasked by Bonifacio to establish [[Katipunan]] in [[Panay Island]]. On March 17, 1897, the young patriot, defender of liberty and leader of the Aklan revolutionists was killed by an assassin during a fight in the present-day Pastrana Park. The untimely death of Gen. del Castillo had signaled the end of the major struggle for freedom in Aklan. His close friends, assistants and soldiers were forced to give up arms, some due to the promise of receiving amnesty. These Nineteen Men, weak from hunger and thirst and racked with rain, were bound together and forced into a black hole of a stone cell on Amadeo Street (now Nineteen Martyrs Street) in [[Kalibo]]. Here their hands were manacled and a long bamboo pole was passed through their locked arms across their mangled backs. Then they were strung high up against the wall of the cell, with their backs to the firing line, and during the first hours of March 23, they were shot to death. The few who did not die instantly were bayoneted. That was a night of darkness and terror in [[Kalibo]].
But such promise was quickly broken. So on the fateful day of March 23, 1897, the Martyrs of Aklan were executed. 

==Legacy==
On March 23, 1897, all 19 prisoners were summarily executed by a firing squad in the town square. Their bodies were hastily buried in a mass grave inside a cemetery. By virtue of a Municipal Council resolution, the mortal remains of 19 martyrs were transferred to its present site at corner M. Laserna and Veterans’ Avenue on March 23, 1926.
In order to commemorate the death anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan, Republic Act No. 7806 was made into law setting the 23rd day of March of every year as a special public holiday in the Province of Aklan. A former general himself, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] let Republic Act 7806 lapsed into law without his signature. And on September 1, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 27(1) of the Constitution became law.

On the 102th martyrdom anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan on March 23, 2018, the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] officially turned over to the Provincial Government of Aklan a tableau memorial in honor of the freedom heroes at the Goding Ramos Park.

A '''patronymic''', or '''patronym''', is a component of a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's father, grandfather (i.e., an '''avonymic'''),&lt;ref&gt;Willy van Langendonck. 2007. ''Theory and Typology of Proper Names''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichler, Ernst et al. (eds.). 1995. ''Namenforschung''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a [[matronymic]]. Each is a means of conveying [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Patronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into [[patronymic surname]]s. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as [[Johnson]] (son of John).

==Origins of terms==

The usual noun and adjective in English is ''patronymic'', but as a noun this exists in [[free variation]] alongside ''patronym''. (The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the corresponding ''metronymic'' and ''metronym'', alongside ''matronymic'' but not, however, ''matronym''.) The first part of the word ''patronym'' comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] πατήρ ''patēr'' "father" (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; πατρός ''patros'' whence the [[combining form]] πατρο- ''patro''-);&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|path/r|πατήρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' "name".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the form ''patronymic'', this stands with the addition of the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] (''-ikos''), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in [[Hellenistic Greek]] as πατρώνυμος (''patrōnymos'') and πατρωνυμικός (''patrōnymikos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|patrw/numos|πατρώνυμος}}, {{LSJ|patrwnumiko/s|πατρωνυμικός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''patronym'', first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French ''patronyme'', which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. ''Patronymic'', first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form ''patronymic'' was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.&lt;ref&gt;"patronym, n."; "patronymic, n. and adj.", ''OED Online'' (3rd edn). March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of [[family name]]s. Family names in many [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[English language|English]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]], [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] surnames originate from patronyms, e.g. [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]] (son of [[William (name)|William]]), [[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]] (son of [[Gerald]]), [[Powell (surname)|Powell]] (from "ap [[Hywel]]"), [[Fernández]] (son of [[Fernando]]), [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]] (son of [[Rodrigo]]), [[Anderson (surname)|Anderson]] or [[Andersen]] (son of [[Anders]], [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] form of [[Andrew (given name)|Andrew]]), [[Carlson (name)|Carlson]] or [[Carlsen (name)|Carlsen]] (son of [[Carl (name)|Carl]]), [[Ilyin]] (of [[Ilya]]), [[Petrov (surname)|Petrov]] (of [[Peter (given name)|Peter]]), [[Grigorovich]] (son of [[Grigory]], [[Russian language|Russian]] form of [[Gregory (given name)|Gregory]]), [[Stefanović]] (son of [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], little Stefan), [[MacAllister]] (from "mac Alistair", meaning son of [[Alistair]], anglicized Scottish form of [[Alexander]]) and [[O'Conor]] (from "Ó Conchobhair", meaning grandson/descendant of [[Conchobhar]]). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.
In [[Iceland]], [[Icelandic name|family names]] are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.

==Historical and current use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

===Africa===
Traditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fulani]] people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The word or phrase meaning "son of" is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is "Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed", and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is "Ali Mohamed Ibrahim".

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
Ethiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name he/she will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Sara Yohannes Petros is Sara (given name) Yohannes (father's name) Petros (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.

====Kenya====
Some Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.
[[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]] used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; 
[[Maasai language|Maasai]] use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Meru language|Meru]] use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.

====Mozambique====
Patronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique.  Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.

====Nigeria====
Now not as prominent as before, Many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name (father's first name) as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like cousin. This custom has dropped to the modern English one due to increase in British style education.

====Somalia====
Somalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term "ina" or "iña" meaning "the son of" or "the daughter of," which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name "Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah" means "Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah." When stating one's lineage, one will say "Ahmed ina Mohamed" (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub=clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.

====South Africa====
Among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix "ka" was attached to the father's name, for example [[Shaka kaSenzangakhona]] means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.

===Asia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

====China====
[[Yi people]]'s sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of father's name. [[Hani people]] also have patronymic customs.

====Taiwan====
[[Atayal people]]'s names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. 
[[Amis people]]'s son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name.

====India====

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

Patronymy is common in parts of [[India]]. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike [[surname]]s, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.

In [[Tamil Nadu]] and some parts of [[Kerala]] and [[South Karnataka]], patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use one's caste as part of the name.

However, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is ''Saravanan'' and his father's ''Krishnan'', then the full name is ''K. Saravanan'' and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as "Krishnan Saravanan". Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist [[R. K. Narayan]]'s name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, [[Graham Greene]]. Rasipuram, the first name, is a [[toponym]] and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.

In Tamilnadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.

Likewise, cricketer Ashwin son of Ravichandran prefers to be referred to as R.Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his fathers name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.

Another upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.

Celebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.

While the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged(but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chaterjee etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.

In [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Gujarat]], a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:

* Cricketer [[Sunil Gavaskar]]'s full name is Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, where Manohar is his father's given name. Sunil Gavaskar's son [[Rohan Gavaskar]] would be Rohan Sunil Gavaskar, and so on.
* Cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s full name is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, where Ramesh is his father's given name.
* First Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s full name is Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, where Jhaverbhai is his father's given name.
* India's 15th Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], famously took oath of office as the Prime Minister of India as Narendra Damodardas Modi, where in Damodardas is his father's given name. He prefers to write his full name including his father's name as his middle name.

This system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.

Indians, particularly [[Tamils]] in [[Singapore]], often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.

[[Malaysian Indians]] may also follow this custom with "son" or "daughter" of being replaced by "anak lelaki" or "anak perempuan", respectively.

Indians of the [[Muslim]] [[Isma'ili]] [[Fiqh|sect]] also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called "Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji" might call his son "Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji" and his granddaughter might be called "Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji".

====Southeast Asia====
In [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of ''given name'' + bin/binti + ''father's name''.

In [[Brunei]], the ruling family of the monarch uses ''given name'' + ''ibni'' + ''father's name'' instead of using bin/binti.

In Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The [[Batak people|Batak]] of [[North Sumatra]] (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.

In Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for [[Sunda language|Sunda]] is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] families.

=====Arabic=====
{{See also|Arabic name#Nasab}}

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word "[[Wiktionary:ibn|ibn]]" ({{lang|ar|ابن}} or {{lang|ar|بن}}: "bin", "ben" and sometimes "ibni" and "ibnu" to show the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Case|grammatical case]] of the noun) is the equivalent of the "-son" suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, "[[Wiktionary:bint|bint]]" ({{lang|ar|بنت}}) means "daughter of". Thus, for example, "Ali ibn `Amr" means "Ali son of `Amr". In Classical Arabic, the word ''ibn'' is written as ''bn'' between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as "b.", as bint is often written as "bt.," in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation "bin" is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word "Abu" ("Aba" or "Abi" in different grammatical cases) means "father of", so "Abu `Ali" is another name for "`Amr".

In medieval times, an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed "ibn Abihi", "son of his father" (notably [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]].) In the [[Qur'an]],  [[Jesus]] ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] in Arabic) is consistently termed "`Isa ibn Maryam" - a [[matronymic]] (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see [[Islamic view of Jesus]]). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, [[Ibn Khaldun]] gives his own full name as "`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun".

Patronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, most of the Arab world has switched to a family name system.{{When|date=May 2015}}  As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. Another form widely used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In [[Iraq]] for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of [[Tikrit]]. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.

=====Aramaic=====
In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the prefix '''''bar-''''' means "son" and is used as a prefix meaning "son of". In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in [[Matthew 16:17]] and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with "P" being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called [[Barnabas]] meaning "son of consolation".

=====Assyrian=====
The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] for centuries have used the patronymic '''''bet''''' or '''''bit''''' literally meaning "house" in [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]; however, in the context of the name it means "from the house of [the father's name]."

=====Jewish=====
{{details|Jewish name}}

[[Jew]]s have historically used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] patronymic names after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], before which the most common language was [[Aramaic]]. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either '''''ben-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the first name was followed by '''''bar-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively).

Permanent family surnames exist today, first by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] in 10th or 11th century [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in [[Prussia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], France, regions of Germany, and other countries.

While Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in [[synagogue]] and in documents in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] such as the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ''ibn'' instead of ''bat'' or ''ben'' when it was the norm. The Spanish family [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]] is one example.

There is a strong cultural pressure for [[Aliyah|immigrants]] to [[Israel|modern Israel]] to [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] their names.&lt;ref name="Kaganoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History|author=Benzion C. Kaganoff|date= 1996-06-01|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|ISBN=9781461627203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IxzRvU_nwcC&amp;pg=PP2 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; 
This practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, [[Golda Meir]] was born "Golda Mabovitch", took the name "Golda Meyerson" after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making [[Aliyah]] and at the urging of [[Moshe Sharett]], [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] her last name to [[Meir (name)|Meir]].&lt;ref name="Neil Caplan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 1956 Sinai Campaign Viewed from Asia: Selections from Moshe Sharett's Diaries|author=Neil Caplan|publisher=Indiana University Press|journal=Israel Studies|volume=7|number=1|date=Spring 2002|pages=81–103|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/is/summary/v007/7.1caplan.html|accessdate=June 3, 2014|doi=10.1353/is.2002.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Persian=====
In [[Persian language|Persian]], patronymics پَتوَند are formed by names ending with the suffix "Pur" "پور" for men and "Dokht" "دُخت" for women. For example: Shahpoor (son of king) and Sinapoor (Ebne sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in [[Iran]], the suffix "pur" is common while in [[Afghanistan]], the suffix "Zadah" "زاده" or "Zad" "زاد" is common.

===Europe===
In Western Europe patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.

====English====
In England, names ending with the suffix "son" were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic [[French language|French]] (more specifically, [[Norman language|Norman]]) prefix ''fitz'' (cognate with the modern French ''[[wikt:fils|fils]]'', meaning "son"), appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the [[Norman Conquest]], and also among the [[Anglo-Irish]]. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name "Fitzroy", meaning "son of [the] king", which was used by illegitimate royal children who were acknowledged as such by their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-258669.html |title=Another Name Question [Archive&amp;#93; - Straight Dope Message Board |publisher=Boards.straightdope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish, Scottish and Manx====
{{See also|Irish name#Patronyms and other additives}}
{{anchor|Ireland|Scotland|Celtic|Gaelic}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The use of "Mac" in some form was prevalent in [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], in all of which it denotes "son". "Mc" is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms "Mag" and "M'" are encountered. The prefix "Mac" is used to form a patronym, such as "Mac Coinnich" – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of ''Mac'' is ''Nic'', condensed from ''nighean mhic'' (in Scottish Gaelic) or ''iníon mhic'' (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, ''Nic Dhòmhnaill'' meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in ''Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill'', or Mary MacDonald.

At the north end of the [[Irish Sea]], in [[Ulster]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Galloway]] (indeed as far north as [[Argyll]]), "Mac" was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as "Qualtrough" (Son of Walter) &amp; "Quayle" (son of Paul, cf. [[MacPhail (disambiguation)|MacPhail]]) – usually beginning with "C", "K" or "Q". In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as "Guinness" (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in "C" or "G" for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in "H" (e.g. "Hurley" (descendant of Jarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with "O". Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]).

====Welsh and Cornish====
{{anchor|Wales|Cornwall}}
{{see also|Welsh surnames|Cornish surnames}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Before the 1536 [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]], the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used [[epithet]]s (e.g. [[Selyf Sarffgadau]], "Selyf the Battle-Serpent"), patronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Merfyn]], "Rhodri son of Merfyn"), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Nest]], "Rhodri son of Nest") to identify people. Welsh, as a [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic language]], originally used ''map'' or ''mab'' instead of the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Q-Celtic]] ''mac'' employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the [[modern Welsh]] ''ap'' and ''ab''. A common practice is to use ''ab'' before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]), but they{{clarify|date=August 2015}} are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.

Daughters were indicated by ''ferch'' or ''verch'' ([[Welsh language#mutation|mutated]] from ''merch'', "girl, daughter"). ''Angharad verch Owain'' would be "Angharad, daughter of Owain".

After the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: ''ap'' or ''ab Ieuan'' often became "Evans"; ''ap Rhys'', "Price"; ''ap'' or ''ab Owain'', "Bowen"; ''ap Hywel'', "Powell" or "Howell". In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' [[middle name]].

Similar rules might apply in [[Cornish surnames|Cornwall]] were it not for its earlier inclusion into England; and therefore patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros&gt;Rouse, [m]ap Richard&gt;Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common than [[Toponymic surname|toponyms]] (e.g. [[Tresillian]], Trevithick, [[Nankivell|Nanskeval/Nankeville]]) and occupational surnames (e.g. [[An Gof]], [An] Gove, ''([[Blacksmith]])''; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a [[slater]] or [[Hunter|huntsman]] (helgher)).&lt;ref name="Kernow names"&gt;[reepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~kernow/names_h.htm Rootsweb Ancestry.com - Kernow names]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], patronymics were often used in place of [[family name]]s or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending ''-zoon'' for sons, ''-dochter'' for daughters. For instance, [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] is "Abel son of Jan Tasman", and [[Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer]]: "Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer". In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as ''-sz.'' and ''-dr.'' respectively e.g. Jeroen Corneli'''sz'''. "Jeroen son of Cornelis", or [[Dirck Jacobsz.|Dirck Jacobsz]]. The endings ''-s'', ''-se'' and ''-sen'' were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, ''-s'', as [[genitive case]], was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -''x'' as in "Tacx" also denoted the son or daughter of Tac, and is now integrated as a complete name.

Patronymics were common in the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] until the [[France|French]] invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|title=Decreet van Naamsaanneming (Napoleon, 18 augustus 1811)|accessdate=2009-04-29|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912024314/http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In France, the terms ''patronyme'' and ''nom patronymique'' had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.

The tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many [[Acadians]], for example, ''Marc à Pierre à Gérard'' (lit. "Marc of Pierre of Gérard"), means "Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard".

====Iberian peninsula====
{{see also|Spanish naming customs|Portuguese naming customs}}
In the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings ''-ez'' and ''-es'' tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to ''-es''; Spanish is also standardized to ''-ez'', but it is very common to see archaic endings in ''-es''. For instance, [[Pires (disambiguation)|Pires]]/[[Peres]] and [[Pérez]] are the modern forms of "[[Peterson (name)|Peterson]]" in Portuguese and Spanish.

In [[Portugal]], there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, ''Álvares'' was the son of ''Álvaro'' and ''Gonçalves'' was the son of ''Gonçalo'' (it was the case of [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], son of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include ''Rodrigues'' (''son of Rodrigo''), ''Nunes'' (''son of Nuno'') and ''Fernandes'' (''son of Fernando'').
In the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin [[genitive]] suffix ''-icius/a'' was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez and eventually Soares. Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.&lt;ref name=port-names1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=port-names2 /&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., [[López]]: of Lope; [[Hernández]]: of Hernán; [[Álvarez (surname)|Álvarez]]: of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -is, and -oz. However, not all names with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of ''Chavo'', but comes from [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chaves'', meaning "keys", and its "s" stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kvs/heraldry/spanish16/ |title=16th Century Spanish Names |author=Elsbeth Anne Roth (Kathy Van Stone) |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science |date=2002 |accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandinavian languages====
{{see also|Icelandic name}}

In Norse custom patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[German language|German]]) to the [[genitive case|genitive]] form of the father's name to indicate "son of", and -dóttir ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and Faroese -dóttir, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for "daughter of". This name was generally used as a last name although a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of [[family name]]. Some [[Early Modern]] examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian [[Peder Claussøn Friis]], the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish [[Thomas Kingo|Thomas Hansen Kingo]], the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.

Eventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing "international" standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the [[Storting|parliament]] passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a [[middle name]] in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being [[Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn]]. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives keeping their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 1700s but was first prevalent in the late 1800s, still present yet uncommon in the 1900s and finally abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored, and from 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En ny lag om personnamn|url=http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/lagradsremiss/2016/04/en-ny-lag-om-personnamn/|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being [[Sweyn Estridsson]].

[[Icelandic name|In Iceland]], patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (occasionally with a minor alteration for genitive) plus the word ''son'' for sons, ''dóttir'' for daughters.&lt;ref name="namelaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/135a/1996045.html|title=Lög um mannanöfn |author=Alþingi Íslands|accessdate=2008-04-02|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] (to be read in English as "Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]").

====Finnish====

In [[Finland]], the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the [[Finnish language|Finnish-speaking]] lower classes.&lt;ref name="paikkala"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paikkala|first1=Sirkka|title=Patronyymit ja matronyymit sukututkimuksissa|url=http://www.genealogia.fi/nimet/nimi16s.htm|website=genealogia.fi|publisher=Suomen Sukututkimusseura|accessdate=2 August 2015|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fi:Nimilaki]]{{Better source|date=June 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word ''poika'' for sons, ''tytär'' for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as "Tuomas, Abraham's son") and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as "Martta, Heikki's daughter").&lt;ref name="paikkala" /&gt;

====Bulgarian====
In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the patronymics are ''-ov''/''-ev'' and ''-ova''/''-eva'' for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of ''family'' names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and [[Czech language|Czech]]). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. ''Ivan Marinov Yordanov'' would be the son of ''Marin Yordanov''.

====Caucasus====

=====Armenian=====
{{main|Armenian surnames}}

The use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by addition of "i" ("of", pronounced as ee) to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is "Armen", the corresponding patronymic would be "Armeni" (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be "Armenovich" for males and "Armenovna" for females. After Armenia re-gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.

Many Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix "-ian" in Western Armenian, often transliterated as "-yan" in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardash'''ian''', Asdvadzadour'''ian''', Hagop'''ian''', Khachadour'''ian''', Mardiros'''ian''', Bedros'''ian''', Sarkiss'''ian''', etc. Note that the suffix "-ian" was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordz'''ian''' (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker, using the Turkish word "chal", meaning candle).

Of particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.

=====Azerbaijani=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], patronymics are formed through ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' (sometimes transliterated as ''ogly'') for males and ''[[:wikt:qız|qızı]]'' (often transliterated as ''gizi'' or ''kizi'') for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu'' ("Sardar, son of Ilyas") and ''Mina Nabi qızı'' ("Mina, daughter of Nabi"), since surnames were mostly non-existent before [[Sovietization]] (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in [[Azerbaijan]] in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev'' ("Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas"). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. ''Eldar Mammadoğlu'', ''Sabina Yusifqızı''). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in ''-zadeh'' (''Kazimzadeh'', ''Mehdizadeh'', etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in ''oglu'' / ''qizi''. Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with [[Turkish language|Turkish]] surnames in ''-oğlu'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames in -ογλού (''-oglou''), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.

=====Georgian=====
{{main|Georgian surname}}
In Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of ''s'' to the end of the father's name, followed by ''dze'' for a man and ''asuli'' for a woman. For example, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. ''s'' in Georgian is a possessive, and ''dze'' and ''asuli'' mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Georgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, ''dze'' and ''shvili'' mean son of, and child, respectively.

====Greek and Greek Cypriot====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Most [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote "''son of''", or more generally "''descendant of''", are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, ''Dēmétrios'', for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr''ópoulos'' ([[Peloponnese]]), Dēmētr''ákos'' ([[Laconia]]), Dēmētr''éas'' ([[Messenia]]n [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]), Dēmētr''átos'' ([[Cephalonia]]), Dēmētr''ákēs'' ([[Crete]]), Dēmētr''iádēs''/Dēmētr''-ídēs'' ([[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Asia Minor]]), Dēmētr''éllēs'' ([[Lesbos]]), Dēmétr''oglou'' ([[Asia Minor]]) (identical to Turkish patronym ''-oğlu''), or simply ''Dēmētríou'' (esp. common in [[Cyprus]], the first name in the [[Genitive]]) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, ''papás'', priest, one derives the surnames ''Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou'' etc., all of which signify a "priest's son". The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. ''Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos'', "the son of the priest Nikolaos". A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but ''always'' declined in the [[Genitive]], e.g. ''Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou'' etc.

In addition to these surnames, ''actual'' patronymics are used in official documents as "middle names" preceding the surname. For example, the children of a ''Giánnēs Papadópoulos'' are, say, ''María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou'' and ''Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos'' (''Ioánnou'' is the [[genitive case]] form of ''Ioánnēs'', which is the formal form of the father's name, ''Giánnēs''). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.

====Hungarian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending ''-fi'' (sometimes spelled as ''-fy'' or ''-ffy''). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as ''Pálfi'' (son of Paul), ''Győrfi'', ''Bánfi'' or in the name of the famous poet [[Sándor Petőfi]] (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name ''Petrovics''). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see [[History of Hungarian]]), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in ''Péter fia András'' (''Peter's son Andrew''); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time.

====Romanian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the endings ''-escu'' and ''-eanu'' were used, as in ''Petrescu'', 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the [[Genitive case|genitive]] form (using the prefix ''a-'') were used, as in ''Amariei'', '(son/daughter) of Maria'.

====Russian====
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[East Slavic languages]], the endings ''-ovich'', ''-evich'' and ''-ich'' are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is ''-yevna'', ''-ovna'' or ''-ichna''. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]], a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or "Ivan, son of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevich'' being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or "Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevna'' being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are ''-ich'' (for men) and ''-inichna'' (for women). Examples in titles  of classical Russian literature include'' [[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]".

In Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends.&lt;ref name=rus1&gt;{{cite book |last=Cubberley |first=Paul |date=17 October 2002 |title=Russian: A Linguistic Introduction |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=355 |isbn=9780521796415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rus2&gt;{{cite book |last=Stakhnevich |first=Julia |date=2007 |title=The Everything Learning Russian Book |publisher=Everything Books |page=74 |isbn=9781598693874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., "Mikhail Nikolayevich") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age.&lt;ref name=rus1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rus3&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Smorodinskaya |editor1-first=Tatiana |editor2-last=Evans-Romaine |editor2-first=Karen |editor3-last=Goscilo |editor3-first=Helena |date=2007 |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=412 |isbn=9781136787867}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work.&lt;ref name=rus3/&gt; In informal situations, if a person is called by a [[diminutive]] (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.&lt;ref name=rus2/&gt;

In [[colloquial]], informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the [[given name]] may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called "Sergeich" or, more rarely, "Sergeyevich". In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: "Ivanovna" but "Mar' Ivanna"; "Sergeyevna"/"Sergevna" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.

====Serbian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
[[Vuk Karadžić]] reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.

In Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and [[Grammatical gender|feminine]].  Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').

====Turkish&lt;!--Turkish not Turkic: see talk page--&gt;====
{{main|Turkish name}}
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the [[suffix]]es used to indicate paternal ancestry are ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' and ''[[:wikt:zadeh|-zade]]'', which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the [[late modern history|late modern]] [[Contemporary history|contemporary age]] many turned into surnames. After the '[[Surname Law|Surname revolution]]' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix ''-oğlu'', such as ''Elbeyioğlu'', ''Bakkaloğlu'' or ''Giritlioğlu'' and with ''-zade'' such as ''[[Begzada|Beyzade]]'', ''Mehmedzade'', ''Yusufzade''.

====Ukrainian====
In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the female patronymic always ends with ''-івна'' ''(-ivna)'' or ''-ївна'' ''(-yivna)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine/&gt; The male patronymic always ends with -''ович'' ''(-ovych)'' or ''-йович'' ''(-yovych)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUmCGXMhQuYC&amp;pg=PA52 Ukrainian:Lonely Planet Phrasebook] by [[Marko Pavlyshyn]], [[Lonely Planet]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-605-2}} (page 52)&lt;/ref&gt; Exception: ''Illia (Ілля)'' -&gt; ''Illich (Ілліч)'' (e.g. [[Élie Metchnikoff|Illia Illich Mechnikov]]), ''Sava (Сава)'' -&gt; ''Savych (Савич)'', ''Iakiv (Яків)'' -&gt; ''Iakovych (Якович)''&lt;ref&gt;Потелло Н.

==History==
Originally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called [[Confinity]] which was acquired by [[X.com]] in 1999. Later X.com was renamed PayPal and purchased by [[eBay]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/11/13/magazines/fortune/paypal_mafia.fortune/index.htm | title=Meet the PayPal mafia | date=November 26, 2007 | last=O'Brien | first=Jeffrey M. | accessdate=December 4, 2009 | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original PayPal employees had difficulty adjusting to eBay's more traditional corporate culture and within four years all but 12 of the first 50 employees had left.&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt;  They remained connected as social and business acquaintances,&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt; and a number of them worked together to form new companies in subsequent years.

==Legacy==
The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the [[dot-com bust]] of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/DDOH107DLG.DTL|date=May 16, 2008|title=Nonfiction review: 'Once You're Lucky'|author=Marcus Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of [[Intel]] in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] after leaving [[Shockley Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; They are discussed in journalist [[Sarah Lacy]]'s book ''Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.''  According to Lacy,  the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of [[Silicon Valley]]; and the diversity of their skill-sets.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie amongst former employees.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wired|title=How PayPal Gave Rise to a Silicon Valley ‘Mafia’|author=Dylan Tweney|date=November 15, 2007|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/11/how-paypal-gave/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed. Gürol Irzik and Güven Güzeldere, (Springer, 2005), 267.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Suleiman]], was recognized as Sultan of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]] by [[Malik Shah I]] in 1084.&lt;ref&gt;Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad.

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8913">[[Image:Sanjūrokkasen-gaku - 8 - Kanō Tan’yū - Sōjō Henjō.jpg|thumb|''Sōjō [[Henjō]]'' by [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 1648]]The {{nihongo|'''Rokkasen'''|六歌仙||"six poetry immortals"}} are six [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poets]] of the mid-ninth century who were named by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] in the ''[[kana]]'' and ''[[Kanji|mana]]'' prefaces to the [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|poetry anthology]] ''[[Kokin Wakashū|Kokin wakashū]]'' (c. 905–14) as notable poets of the generation before its compilers.

== History of the term ==
In their original appearance in the prefaces of the ''Kokin wakashū'', the six ''rokkasen'' are not actually referred to with this term.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous phrases that show the conceptualization of these six as a cohesive group, but the term "Rokkasen" first appeared in an early Kamakura-period commentary on ''Kokin wakashū'', titled ''Sanryūshō'' 三流抄.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1986|title=Rokkasen|encyclopedia=Waka Daijiten|publisher=Meiji Sho-in|last=Masuda|first=Shigeo|date=|page=1083|language=ja|editor1-last=Inukai|editor1-first=Kiyoshi|editor2-last=Inoue|editor2-first=Muneo|editor3-last=Ohkubo|editor3-first=Tadashi|editor4-last=Ono|editor4-first=Hiroshi|editor5-last=Tanaka|editor5-first=Yutaka|editor6-last=Hashimoto|editor6-first=Fumio|editor7-last=Fujihira|editor7-first=Haruo|trans-title=The Six Poetry Immortals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The members of the ''rokkasen'', and their total poems in ''Kokin wakashū,'' are as follows:
*[[Ōtomo no Kuronushi]], 3 poems
*[[Ono no Komachi]], 18 poems
*[[Ariwara no Narihira]], 30 poems
*[[Kisen Hōshi]], 1 poem
*[[Henjō|Sōjō Henjō]], 17 poems
*[[Fun'ya no Yasuhide]], 1 poem

== Tsurayuki's Criticism ==
In his prefaces to the anthology ''Kokin wanashū'', Ki no Tsurayuki first praises two poets, [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] and [[Yamabe no Akahito]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; from the period before the ''rokkasen'' and then praises these six poets of the generation preceding his own, but also critiques what he considers to be weaknesses in their personal styles.

His criticism in both prefaces is as follows:

''Kana preface''

::Among well-known recent poets, Archbishop Henjō masters style but is deficient in substance. It is no more satisfying to read one of his poems than to fall in love with a woman in a picture. The poetry of Ariwara Narihira tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower with a lingering fragrance. Fun'ya no Yasuhide's language is skillful, but his style is inappropriate to his content. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy costumes. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is veiled, leaving us uncertain about his meaning. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Since not many of his poems are known, we cannot study them as a group in order to evaluate him. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same line as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is moving and lacking in strength. It reminds us of a beautiful woman suffering from an illness. Its weakness is probably due to her sex. The style of Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems is crude. They are like a mountain peasant resting under a flowering tree with a load of firewood on his back.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=7|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mana preface''

::The Kazan Archbishop [Henjō] masters style, but his flowery language bears little fruit. His poems, like a picture of a beautiful woman, move our hearts without leading to anything. The poetry of the Ariwara Middle Captain [Narihira] tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower that retains its fragrance. Bunrin [Fun'ya no Yasuhide] deals cleverly with topics, but his style approaches vulgarity. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy dress. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is dazzling, but his poems do not flow smoothly. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same like as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is beautiful but weak, like an ailing woman wearing cosmetics. Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems belong to the line of Sarumaru of old. Although his poetry has a certain light, witty interest, the style is extremely crude, as though a peasant were resting in front of a flowering tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=257–8|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying theories on both why Tsurayuki chose these six poets and why he chose to criticize them in this manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Helen Craig McCullough|Helen McCullough]] claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brocade by Night: 'Kokin Wakashū' and the Court Style in Japanese Classical Poetry|last=McCullough|first=Helen Craig|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8047-1246-8|location=Stanford, CA|pages=313–4|translator-last=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (''kokoro'' 心) and words (''kotoba'' 言葉).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncovering Heian Japan: An Archaeology of Sensation and Inscription|last=Lamarre|first=Thomas|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780822380467|location=Durham, NC|pages=166–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The concept of the ''rokkasen'' had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods.

In 1009–1011, [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] compiled an expanded list known as the [[Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan Encyclopedia|last=Frédéric|first=Louis|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=0674007700|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=818}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the "Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry," and the "Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry."

Many Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of ''waka'' poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the ''waka'' anthologies ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' and ''Kokin wakashū''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46–54 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the ''waka'' poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (六歌仙時代 ''rokkasen jidai''), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of [[Emperor Kōkō|Emepror Kōkō]], but disagree on whether it begins with [[Emperor Ninmyō]] or [[Emperor Montoku]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shimada |first=Ryōji |date=February 1970 |title=Rokkasen jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40001325603 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=42 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ryōji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmyō is the better choice for the start of this periodization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, Ōtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu|Hyakunin isshū]]''.

The '''royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom''', or the '''Royal Arms''' for short, is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[British monarch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308050901/https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 10, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf Government identity system (2012)]. HM Government. "The Queen is Head of State, and the United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
The royal coat of arms is personal to the Queen and..."&lt;/ref&gt; currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the [[United Kingdom]]. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the [[British royal family]]; and by the [[British government]] in connection with the administration and government of the country. In [[Scotland]], there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]]. The arms in [[banner of arms|banner form]] serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the ''[[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]''.

In the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure [[fleur-de-lis#Other European monarchs and rulers|flory-counterflory]] of Scotland; and in the third, a [[Clàrsach|harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooke-Little |first=J.P., FSA |authorlink=John Brooke-Little |title=Boutell's Heraldry |origyear=1950 |edition=Revised |year=1978 |publisher=Frederick Warne LTD |location=London |isbn=0-7232-2096-4 |pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a [[Lion (heraldry)|statant guardant lion]] wearing the [[St Edward's Crown]], himself on another representation of that crown. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporters|supporter]] is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish [[unicorn]]. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/royal%20unicorn.htm|title=Heraldic Sculptor- Accessed 29 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were both supporting unicorns in the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]].

In the greenery below, a [[thistle]], [[Tudor rose]] and [[shamrock]] are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This [[armorial achievement]] comprises the [[motto]], in [[French language|French]], of [[English monarchs]], ''[[Dieu et mon Droit]]'' (God and my Right), which has descended to the present [[royal family]] as well as the [[Order of the Garter#Heraldry|Garter circlet]] which surrounds the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], inscribed with the [[Order of the Garter|Order]]'s motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'' (Shame on him who thinks evil).
The official [[blazon]] of the Royal Arms is:

{{quote|''Quarterly, first and fourth Gules three Lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), second quarter Or a Lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), third quarter Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Garter; for a Crest, upon the Royal helm the Imperial Crown Proper, thereon a Lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned Proper; Mantling Or and Ermine; for Supporters, dexter a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned as the Crest, sinister a Unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses patées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. Motto "Dieu et mon Droit" in the compartment below the shield, with the Union Rose, Shamrock and Thistle engrafted on the same stem.''&lt;ref name="Boutell"/&gt;}}

==Uses==
[[File:St Andrew's church - royal arms - geograph.org.uk - 1708484.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Royal Arms as used by the [[House of Stuart]] (these being of William III and Mary II (1688-1694/1702))]]

The Royal Arms as shown above may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions of the courts|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-traditions/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in the [[City of London]], where behind the [[Justices of the Peace]] stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In [[Northern Ireland]], the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast]] and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.&lt;ref&gt;Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26) 66 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/body/enacted Display of Royal Arms at courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the Royal Arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Government identity system HM Government&lt;/ref&gt; and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]].

The Royal Arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the [[Royal Mint]] including, for example, from 1663, the [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]] and, from 1983, the [[British one pound coin]].  In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms.  The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the Royal Arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx The New Designs Revealed&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404064611/http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch grants [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]s to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those businesses to display the Royal Arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.

It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] to display the Royal Arms to show loyalty to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Britain and Treasures of Ireland|edition=1976|publisher=Drive Publications|page=677}} Retrieved 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/royal-arms-in-church/|title=Royal Arms in church|publisher=Intriguing History|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A banner of the Royal Arms, known as the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the [[Union Flag]], or in Scotland the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], is flown.

The widely sold British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', displays the current Royal Arms.

The Royal Arms are also displayed in all courts in [[British Columbia]], as well as in other Canadian provinces such as [[Ontario]], where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Welcome&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Arms were also displayed by all [[Governor-General of Australia|Viceroys of Australia]] as representation of their Crown authority.

The Royal Arms are also used and displayed in the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria.

The Royal Arms are also the coat of arms for the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].

The Royal Arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her official letterhead from {{circa|1997|lk=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Summers |first2=Ben |last2=Streeter |first=Michael |title=The strange case of Lady Thatcher and Her Majesty's coat of arms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-strange-case-of-lady-thatcher-and-her-majestys-coat-of-arms-1274739.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Royal coat of arms of Scotland}}
Since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, a separate version of the Royal Arms has been used in [[Scotland]], giving the Scottish elements pride of place.

The [[shield]] is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion ''rampant'' of Scotland; in the second, the three lions ''passant guardant'' of England; and in the third, the harp of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] atop the [[Crown of Scotland]] is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the [[Honours of Scotland]], namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the Royal Arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The motto, in [[Scots language|Scots]], appears above the crest, in the tradition of [[Scottish heraldry]], and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]''.

The supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporter]] is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.

The coat also features both the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'' (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle]]. On the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
[[File:St Mary, Stone, Kent - Royal Arms - geograph.org.uk - 1490059.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The current version of the Royal Arms, displayed in the parish church of [[Stone, Kent]].]]
Unlike the [[Acts of Union 1707]] with Scotland, the [[Acts of Union 1800]] with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms.{{dubious|1706/7 says "the quartering the Arms, and the Rank and Precedency of the Lyon King of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland as may best suit the Union, be left to her Majesty" and 1800 says nothing for or against. If the contention is that the 1800 acts have been interpreted as FORBIDDING separate royal arms for Ireland, then that requires specific cites.|date=November 2017}} The [[Arms of Ireland#Achievement|crest of the Kingdom of Ireland]] (''on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or'') has had little or no official use since the union. When the [[Irish Free State]] established [[great Seal of the Irish Free State|its own seals]] in the 1930s, the "Fob Seal" used on [[letter of credence|letters of credence]] varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2243 |title=Memorandum on external seals |first=Joseph |last=Walshe |authorlink=Joseph Walshe |date=26 October 1937 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Vol. V No. 97 |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harp quarter of the Royal Arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions.  Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version.  Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the Royal Arms since they came under one monarch.
By contrast, there is no representation at all for [[Wales]] in the Royal Arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms.  However the argument is somewhat disengenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the Royal Arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn
In the 20th century, the [[coat of arms of Wales|arms of the principality of Wales]] were added as an inescutcheon to the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|coat of arms]] of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales.  The so-called [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case.  They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]]) and carry the motto ''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}'' ([[German language|German]], "I Serve").  In any event, they do not form part of the Royal Arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.

==History==

===Kingdoms of England and Scotland===
The current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the [[United Kingdom]], and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scotland. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.

==Other variants==

===Royal family===
Members of the [[British royal family]] are granted their own personal arms which are based on the Royal Arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]]; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. 
Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] has been granted his own personal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:

Various versions of the Royal Arms are used by [[Her Majesty's Government]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.

HM Government generally uses a simplified version of the Royal Arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment.&lt;ref&gt;GOV.UK, Departments, agencies and public bodies [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations]. Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Scotland, the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] use the Scottish version, again without the [[Helmet|helm]] or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the [[Scottish Executive]] until September 2007, when a [[rebranding]] exercise introduced the name ''[[Scottish Government]]'', together with a revised logo incorporating the [[flag of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194010/http://news.gov.scot/news/new-lord-lyon-king-of-arms-appointed |www.gov.scot New Lyon King-of-arms appointed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.

The simplified Royal Arms also feature:

* on all [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];
* on the cover of all [[British passport|UK passports]];
* as an inescutcheon on the [[diplomatic flag]]s of British Ambassadors; and
* on all acts of the [[Anguilla House of Assembly]], the [[Sovereign Base Areas]], [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] administrations.

Various courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the Royal Arms:

* The [[Court of Appeal of British Columbia|Court of Appeal]], [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] and [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/court_of_appeal/hearing_list/|title=Court of Appeal - Hearing List|website=www.courts.gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/|title=Provincial Court of British Columbia|website=www.provincialcourt.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore:
* A version of the crest of the Royal Arms, as used in Scotland, is used by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms encircled by the Garter is used by the [[Home Office]] and by the [[Parliament of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/|title=Parliament of Victoria - Home|website=www.parliament.vic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms is used by the [[Royal Mint]].

}}
According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early middle ages===
The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

'''The Five''', also known as the '''Mighty Handful''' and the '''New Russian School''', were five prominent 19th-century Russian [[composers]] who worked together to create distinct [[Russian classical music]]. [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] all lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

==History==

===Name===
[[Image:Vladimir Stasov.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Stasov]] &lt;br&gt; (1824&amp;ndash;1906)]]
In May 1867 the critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] wrote an article, titled ''Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert'', covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the "All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended with the following statement:

{{quote|God grant that our Slav guests may never forget today's concert; God grant that they may forever preserve the memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent, and intelligence are possessed by the small but already mighty handful of Russian musicians.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"&gt;Calvocoressi, M.D., Abraham, G., ''Master Musicians Series: Mussorgsky'', London: J.M.Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1946, pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;|Vladimir Stasov|''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]], 1867''}}

The expression "mighty handful" ({{lang-ru|Могучая кучка}}, ''Moguchaya kuchka'', "Mighty Bunch") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: [[Alexander Serov|Aleksandr Serov]], academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"/&gt; This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin &amp;mdash; the five who have come to be associated with the name "Mighty Handful", or sometimes "The Five". [[Gerald Abraham]] stated flatly in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that "they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'"&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; (although today the Russian equivalent "Пятёрка" ("Pyatyorka") is occasionally used to refer to this group).&lt;ref&gt;''Krugosvet'', "[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/muzyka/BALAKIREV_MILI_ALEKSEEVICH.html Balakirev Mily Alekseevich]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as "Balakirev's circle", and occasionally uses "The Mighty Handful", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to "The Five":

{{quote|If we leave out of account [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky|Lodyzhensky]], who accomplished nothing, and [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], who appeared later, Balakirev's circle consisted of Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and me (the French have retained the denomination of "''Les Cinq''" for us to this day).&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, N., ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', New York: Knopf, 1923, pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov|''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', 1909}}

The Russian word ''kuchka'' also spawned the terms "kuchkism" and "kuchkist", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

The name of [[Les Six]], an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of "The Five".

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and [[César Cui]]. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] joined them in 1857, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1861, and [[Alexander Borodin]] in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in [[chemistry]]. Rimsky-Korsakov was a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval officer]] (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more "authentically Russian," in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, ''Defining Russia Musically'', xiii ff, per Figes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before them, [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of "The Five" are buried in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Musical language==

===Stylization===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in [[Cossack]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and [[melisma]]tic peasant song, what Glinka had once called "the soul of Russian music."  Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one [[tonal center]] to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**[[Heterophony]]
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**[[consecutive fifth|Parallel fifth]]s, fourths and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct "Russian" style and color different from Western music. This "exotic" styling of "Russia" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices was actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**[[Whole tone scale]]
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842) &amp;mdash; most recognizable at the end of the festive overture &amp;mdash; provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in "Russian" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'') to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', ''[[Kashchey the Deathless]]'' and ''[[The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|The Invisible City of Kitezh]]''). [[Claude Debussy]] also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The [[Russian submediant]]&lt;ref&gt;DeVoto, Mark. "The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century," Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Also linked to Glinka's  ''Ruslan'', this is a harmonic pattern (in  major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic):  root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherezade]]''.
**[[Octatonic scale|Diminished or octatonic scale]]
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem ''Sadko'' in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card &amp;mdash; a ''[[leitmotif]]'' of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of [[Franz Liszt]] their own to base a loose [[symphonic poem|symphonic-poem]] type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in [[sonata form]], allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the "content" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pentatonic scale]]
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the [[heptatonic scale]]s (e.g., [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]]). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a "primitive" folk-melodic style as well as the "Eastern" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the "major-mode" pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]''.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of "The Five" was its reliance on [[orientalism]].&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Many quintessentially "Russian" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's ''[[Islamey]]'', Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of "The Five," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-oriented composers.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rimsky-Korsakov)|First Symphony]], Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; "The symphony is good," Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.&lt;ref name="maes82"&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often reinforced through [[Misogyny|misogynist]] symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.&lt;ref name="maes80"/&gt;

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' and Balakirev's symphonic poem ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; ''Antar'', set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian).&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt;

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a ''lezginka'', modeled on Glinka, for this work.&lt;ref name="maes83"/&gt; However, he discovered a poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing ''Tamara''. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished [[interval (music)|intervals]] and extended [[melisma]]s, depict sensual longing.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of ''Tamara'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, [[Alexander Spendiaryan]] went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.

==Quotations==
[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] provides the following picture of "The Mighty Handful" in his memoirs, ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'' (translated by J. A. Joffe):

===Tastes===
{{quote|"The tastes of the circle leaned towards Glinka, Schumann, and Beethoven's last quartets ... they had little respect for Mendelssohn ... Mozart and Haydn were considered out of date and naive ... J. S. Bach was held to be petrified ... Chopin was likened by Balakirev to a nervous society lady ... Berlioz was highly esteemed ...Liszt was comparatively unknown ... Little was said of Wagner ... They respected Dargomyzhsky for the recitative portions of ''Rusalka'' ... [but] he was not credited with any considerable talent and was treated with a shade of derision. ...Rubinstein had a reputation as a pianist, but was thought to have neither talent nor taste as a composer."}}

===Balakirev===
{{quote|"Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary ... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with the sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinary memory, keen and retentive, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature ... He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once. Whenever I or other young men, later on, played him our essays at composition, he instantly caught all the defects of form, modulation, and so on, and forthwith seating himself at the piano, he would improvise and show how the composition in question should be changed exactly as he indicated, and frequently entire passages in other people's compositions became his and not their putative authors' at all. He was obeyed absolutely, for the spell of his personality was tremendous. ... His influence over those around him was boundless, and resembled some magnetic or mesmeric force. ... he despotically demanded that the tastes of his pupils should exactly coincide with his own. The slightest deviation from his taste was severely censured by him. By means of raillery, a parody or caricature played by him, whatever did not suit him at the moment was belittled — and the pupil blushed with shame for his expressed opinion and recanted...."}}

===Abilities===
{{quote|"Balakirev considered me a symphony specialist ... in the sixties, Balakirev and Cui, though very intimate with Mussorgsky and sincerely fond of him, treated him like a lesser light, and of little promise at that, in spite of his undoubted talent. It seemed to them that there was something missing in him and, in their eyes, he was in need of advice and criticism. Balakirev often said that Mussorgsky had 'no head' or that his 'brains were weak.' ... Balakirev thought that Cui understood little in symphony and musical forms and nothing in orchestration, but was a past master in vocal and operatic music; Cui, in turn, thought Balakirev a master in symphony, form, and orchestration, but with little liking for operatic composition and vocal music in general. Thus they complemented each other, but each, in his own way, felt mature and grown up. Borodin, Mussorgsky, and I, however &amp;mdash; we were immature and juvenile. Obviously, towards Balakirev and Cui we were in somewhat subordinate relations; their opinions were listened to unconditionally...."}}

==Influence==
Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] through their radical tonal language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">The '''Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan''' ({{lang-es|Trece mártires de Bagumbayan}}) were [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Patriotism|patriots]] in the [[Philippines]] who were executed by musketry on January 11, 1897, for cooperating with the [[Katipunan]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.executedtoday.com/2010/01/11/1897-the-thirteen-martyrs-of-bagumbayan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Martyrs==
* '''[[José Dizon|Jose M. Dizon]]''' -  was a Filipino patriot who was among those who founded the [[Katipunan]] that sparked the [[Philippine Revolution]]. Dizon was born in [[Binondo, Manila]]. In April 1892, he was inducted into the freemasonic lodge founded by Pedro Serrano Laktaw. That same year, he founded the lodge Taliba in Trozo, Manila and served as its venerable master. He was also among the officers of the grand regional council that included [[Apolinario Mabini]].
* '''Domingo Franco''' - Born in [[Mambusao, Capiz]], Franco was the third among the six children of Juan Franco and Ciriaca Tuason. His father worked as procurador judicial, or solicitor, in the local justice of the peace court. He kept in his care the documents of the [[La Liga Filipina]] as ordered by [[José Rizal|Jose Rizal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/wv/page3.html|title=WESTERN VISAYAS, Philippines Unsung Heroes|website=www.msc.edu.ph|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeriano Adriano''' - A reformist, Adriano was one of those executed by the Spaniards soon after the revolution in 1896 broke out. He was the eldest of the seven children of Pioquinto Adriano and Agapita Resurreccion of Beata, [[Pandacan, Manila]]. Adriano enrolled in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], but it is not known whether he finished a degree. For twenty years, he worked in the third branch of the Court of the First Instance as clerk of court.
* '''Moises Salvador''' - was a contractor, mason, and propagandist. Salvador was born in San Sebastian which was formerly a part of [[Quiapo, Manila]]. He was the son of Ambrosio Salvador, founding president of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and Acosta Francisco.
* '''Faustino Villaruel''' - a merchant from [[Pandacan, Manila]]. A mason and one of the founding member of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and supporter of the propaganda movement.
* '''Francisco L. Roxas''' - was a businessman, musician and a second cousin of one of the richest men in the [[Philippines]] at that time, Don Pedro Pablo Roxas. He was born in [[Binondo, Manila]].
* '''Luis Enciso Villareal''' - was a member of the Propaganda Movement. Villareal was born in [[Daraga, Albay]]. His father, Francisco Villareal, was known to be a “wonderful fiddler” and a graceful dancer. Meanwhile, his mother was Maria Espinas. His parents own an abaca plantation. He was initially enrolled in the town school but was later sent to a seminary in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] where he finished with a bachelor of arts degree.
* '''Geronimo M. Cristobal''' - He was an infantry corporal in the regiment known by the nickname “Burgos.” As he stood there facing the array of guns pointed menacingly at him and his companions, he must have thought it rather unreal that he should meet his fate at the hand of his former comrades-in-arms, some of whom could be his friends.
* '''Antonio Salazar''' - Salazar y San Agustin was one of the 13 Masons and revolutionaries who were executed by the Spanish authorities.
* '''Ramon Padilla''' - Padilla at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution in 1896 was said to be a clerk at the Comandancia de la Marina (Navy).
* '''Braulio Rivera''' - Born in Gitna (now renamed after him), [[Tondo, Manila]] near the corner of Zabala and Sto. Cristo Streets. Rivera was the son of Jose Rivera, a worker at the tobacco monopoly administration. Little is known of his early background: although only an elementary graduate, he was employed as a clerk at the “Sub-inspeccion General de Montes”. He was blessed with an exceptional singing voice thus, was inclined to singing. He was also an able musician who played three instruments - the guitar, violin and flute.
* '''Faustino Mañalac''' - He was a clerk in the Port of Manila administration and headed the Ilog Pasig council of the KKK in Binondo. A son of a carpenter at the naval shipyard in San Roque, Cavite, he became a member of the KKK Supreme Council using the alias "Mayon". Married to Marta Saldaña, who was a member of the KKK women's section along with Gregoria de Jesus, Maria Dizon, Josefa and Trinidad Rizal, Mañalac is listed among those who visited the Pamitinan caves with [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]], [[Aurelio Tolentino]], Guillermo Masangkay on Good Friday, 1895 and wrote about Philippine independence on the walls of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16656/16656-h/16656-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&amp;id=16yXRtEdRI5NtFkXamjeQJpRX8i6NUsLsBUUEgy3hTC4&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Benedicto P. Nijiga''' - During a raid of a printing press in Binondo, the Spaniards found and confiscated subversive documents including a list of members of the Katipunan. Benedicto Nijaga was on the list as a collector of revolutionary funds. Upon the order of Gov. Polavieja to arbitrarily arrest all suspected members of the Katipunan, Nijaga was arrested while he was campaigning for revolutionary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calbayogko.tripod.com/id1.html|title=History|website=calbayogko.tripod.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of Twelve Men''' was a group of 12 men, chosen on 29 August 1641 by the residents of [[New Netherland]] to advise the [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director of New Netherland]], [[Willem Kieft]], on relations with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] due to the murder of Claes Swits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the council was not permanent, it was the first representational form of democracy in the Dutch colony. The next two councils created were known as the [[Eight Men]] and the  [[Nine Men]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = New Amsterdam Notable Citizens   | publisher = Geni.com   | date =    | url = http://www.geni.com/projects/New-Amsterdam-Notable-Citizens/5376   | accessdate = 2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
==Three Questions==
#Whatever it is not just to punish the barbarous murder of Claes Swits committed by an Indian and, in case the Indians refuse to surrender the murderer at our request, whether it is not justifiable to ruin the entire village to which he belongs?
#In what manner the same ought be put into effect and at what time?
#By whom it may be undertaken?

==War==
They did not counsel war, as desired by [[Willem Kieft]]. They proposed a friendly request to be sent to the Indians to surrender the murderer. Displeased  with the reply of the council of twelve, he disassembled the council on February 8, 1643.Kieft then ordered the [[Dutch West India Company]] soldiers to attack nearby Indian encampments at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] and [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Corlears Hook]]. Escalating attacks and retaliations by the Indians and the Dutch West India Company soldiers during the next two years became known as [[Kieft's War]] and led to a near devastation of the [[New Netherland]] settlements on [[Staten Island]], [[Long Island]], and at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]].

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.
