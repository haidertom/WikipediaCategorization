      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''3DML''' was a format for creating three-dimensional websites build up by combining similar sized building blocks. It was invented in 1997 by Michael Powers, who co-developed with Philip Stevens and developed further over the next four years. 3DML files are written in an [[XML]] syntax which can be delivered from standard web servers and shown within a browser plugin and independent 3DML [[web browser|browser]] called Flatland Rover. A new update was posted in 2018 with updated code and binaries for Windows 10. 3DML had no avatar or multi-user support unlike other platforms of the time like [[Active Worlds]] thus never attracting a huge number of followers. There was only a plugin for [[Internet Explorer]], [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[AOL]], but not for [[Mozilla Firefox]]. The most recent version is a standalone Windows application.

A 3DML world was called a "Spot". In the spot "blocks" can be inserted, laid out in a grid. The blocks can be ordered into "levels" - each has the same size. This approach was designed to simplify the building process and comprehension of 3D pages. The following is an example of a full Spot description of a 3D room with walls.
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;spot version="3.5"&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;debug /&gt;
     &lt;title name="Tall Spot" /&gt;
     &lt;blockset
      href="http://blocksets.flatland.com/flatsets/basic.bset"/&gt;
     &lt;map style="single" dimensions="(9,9,2)" /&gt;
     &lt;sky texture="images/clouds.gif" brightness="90%" /&gt;
     &lt;ground texture="images/dirt.gif" /&gt;
     &lt;ambient_light brightness="100%" /&gt;
     &lt;ambient_sound file="sounds/waves.wav" volume="65%"
      playback="looped"/&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;level number="1"&gt;
     ###...###
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #.......#
     #########
     &lt;/level&gt;
     &lt;level number="2"&gt;
     ###---###
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #-------#
     #########
     &lt;/level&gt;
     &lt;entrance location="(5,8,1)" name="default" angle="0,0" /&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/spot&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
You can navigate the spots by using either mouse or arrow keys.

'''Applied physics''' is intended for a particular technological or [[applied science|practical use]]. It is usually considered as a bridge or connection between [[physics]] and [[engineering]].

"Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors, such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the [[technology]] or [[science]] that may be affected by the work. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the [[physical science]]s, but is concerned with the utilization of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Information on Applied Physics |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |publisher=Stanford Department of Applied Physics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307121331/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |archive-date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It usually differs from engineering in that an applied [[physicist]] may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving an engineering problem. This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. 

In other words, applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences but is concerned with the utilization of these scientific principles in practical devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Applied Physics |url=http://www.sci.waseda.ac.jp/research/BELONG/E/02802.html|publisher=Waseda University|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied [[physicists]] can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, the field of [[accelerator physics]] can contribute to research in theoretical physics by working with engineers enabling design and construction of high-energy [[collider]]s.

[[File:Band-brake (for bicycle rear wheel)b.jpg|thumb|Band brake for rear wheel of a bicycle.]]
A '''band brake''' is a primary or secondary [[brake]], consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or "holding" brake), or to slow it (a [[dynamic brake]]). This application is common on [[winch]] drums and [[chain saw]]s and is also used for some [[bicycle brake]]s.

A former application was the locking of gear rings in [[epicyclic gearing]]. In modern automatic transmissions this task has been taken over entirely by [[Clutch#Multiple plate clutch|multiple-plate clutches]] or multiple-plate brakes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014|reason="Entirely" is a strong word.}}

== Features ==

Band brakes can be simple, compact, rugged, and can generate high force with a light input force.  However, band brakes are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot.  These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where band brakes are a good solution.

== Effectiveness ==

One way to describe the effectiveness of the brake is as &lt;math&gt;e^{\mu \theta}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of friction]] between band and drum, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of wrap.  With a large &lt;math&gt;\mu \theta&lt;/math&gt;, the brake is very effective and requires low input force to achieve high brake force, but is also very sensitive to changes in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, light rust on the drum may cause the brake to "grab" or chatter, water may cause the brake to slip, and rising temperatures in braking may cause the coefficient of friction to drop slightly but in turn cause brake force to drop greatly.  Using a band material with low &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; increases the input force required to achieve a given brake force, but some low-&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; materials also have more consistent &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; across the range of working temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="887">'''Compact surveillance radar''' are small lightweight radar systems that have a wide coverage area and are able to track people and vehicles in range and [[azimuth]] angle. They weigh less than 10 pounds, consume less than 15 Watts of power and are easily deployed in large numbers.  

Compact surveillance radar have the same characteristics of the larger [[Radar MASINT#Ground Surveillance Radar|Ground Surveillance Radar]](GSR) namely; the ability to track many moving targets simultaneously, all weather day &amp; night operation, wide coverage areas and the ability to track targets and cue cameras automatically.

Key:
* To save space, the "EOS" is left out from Canon model names.
* ISO values include maximum sensor range, even if in manual mode ("H1", "Hi 1", etc.)
* Continuous shooting: fps is "frames per second", indicates the highest speed for full resolution, without separate battery grip (i.e., not integrated into the body).
* [[Memory card]] types: CF is [[CompactFlash]], SD is [[Secure Digital]].
* Dimensions are rounded to the nearest whole number.
* Weight: with standard battery unless noted otherwise.

== Temporal characteristics ==
Different display technologies have vastly different temporal characteristics, leading to perceptual differences for motion, flicker, etc.
[[Image:Display technology temporal characteristics.gif|center|750px|Sketch of some common display technologies' temporal behaviour]]

The figure shows a sketch of how different technologies present a single white/grey frame. Time and intensity is not to scale. Notice that some have a fixed intensity, while the illuminated period is variable. This is a kind of [[pulse-width modulation]]. Others can vary the actual intensity in response to the input signal.

*Single-chip DLPs use a kind of "chromatic multiplexing" in which each color is presented serially. The intensity is varied by modulating the "on" time of each pixel within the time-span of one color. Multi-chip DLPs are not represented in this sketch, but would have a curve identical to the plasma display.
*LCDs have a constant (backlit) image, where the intensity is varied by blocking the light shining through the panel.
*CRTs use an electron beam, scanning the display, flashing a lit image. If interlacing is used, a single full-resolution image results in two "flashes". The physical properties of the phosphor are responsible for the rise and decay curves.
*Plasma displays modulate the "on" time of each sub-pixel, similar to DLP.
*Movie theaters use a mechanical shutter to illuminate the same frame 2 or 3 times, increasing the flicker frequency to make it less perceptible to the human eye.

This article '''compares the technical specifications of multiple high definition formats''', including HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc; two mutually incompatible, high definition optical disc formats that, beginning in 2006, attempted to improve upon and eventually replace the [[DVD]] standard. The two formats remained in a [[format war]] until February 19, 2008 when Toshiba, HD DVD's creator, announced plans to cease development, manufacturing and marketing of HD DVD players and recorders.&lt;ref name=toshibadrophddvd&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm|title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses|publisher=Toshiba Press Department|date=2008-02-19|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other high-definition optical disc formats were attempted, including the multi-layered red-laser [[Versatile Multilayer Disc]] and a Chinese made format called [[Enhanced Versatile Disc|EVD]].  Both appear to have been abandoned {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}by their respective developers.

{{note|HDMC_table_note_a}}'''a''' These maximum storage capacities apply to currently released media as of January 2012.  First two layers of Blu-ray have a 25 GB capacity, but the triple layer disc adds a further 50 GB making 100 GB total.  The fourth layer adds a further 28 GB. &lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_b}}'''b''' All HD DVD players are required to decode the two primary channels (left and right) of any Dolby TrueHD track;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdprg.com/jpn/about/hddvd/page04.html HD DVD Promotion Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdforum.org/images/DVD-Forum-070605_ENG_rev110.pdf DVD Forum.org HD DVD Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; however, every Toshiba made stand-alone HD DVD player released thus far decodes 5.1 channels of TrueHD.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_c}}'''c''' On November 1, 2007 Secondary video and audio decoder became mandatory for new Blu-ray Disc players when the [[Blu-ray Disc#Player profiles|Bonus View]] requirement came into effect. However, players introduced to the market before this date can continue to be sold without Bonus View.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_d}}'''d''' There are some differences in the implementation of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) on the two formats. On Blu-ray Disc, DD+ can only be used to extend a primary Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 audiotrack.  In this method 640 kbit/s is allocated to the primary DD 5.1 audiotrack (which is independently playable on players that do not support DD+), and up to 1 Mbit/s is allocated for the DD+ extension. The DD+ extension is used to replace the rear channels of the DD track with higher fidelity versions, along with adding additional channels for 6.1/7.1 audiotracks. On HD DVD, DD+ is used to encode all channels (up to 7.1), and no legacy DD track is required since all HD DVD players are required to decode DD+.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_e}}'''e'''  On PAL DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 50 interlaced frames per second and gets replayed 4% faster. This process can be reversed to retrieve the original 24 frame per second content. On NTSC DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 60 interlaced frames per second using a process called [[Telecine#DVDs|3:2 pulldown]], which if done properly can also be reversed.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_f}}'''f''' As of July 2008, about 66.7% of Blu-ray discs are region free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics |accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_g}}'''g''' DVD supports any valid [[MPEG-2]] refresh rate as long as it is packaged with metadata converting it to 576i50 or 480i60, This metadata takes the form of REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD instructions embedded in the MPEG-2 stream itself, and is a part of the MPEG-2 standard. HD DVD is the only high-def disc format that can decode 1080p25 while Blu-ray and HD DVD can both decode 1080p24 and 1080p30. 1080p25 content can only be presented on Blu-ray as 1080i50.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_h}}'''h''' Linear PCM is the only lossless audio codec that is mandatory for both HD DVD and Blu-ray disc players, only HD DVD players are required to decode two lossless sound formats and those are Linear PCM and Dolby TrueHD. Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio have become sound format of choice for many studios on their Blu-ray titles but ever since Blu-ray won the format war, it has not become clear if they are now Mandatory for all new Blu-ray disc players since the end of the format war.

===Capacity/codecs===
Blu-ray Disc has a higher maximum disc capacity than HD DVD (50&amp;nbsp;GB vs. 30&amp;nbsp;GB for a double layered disc). In September 2007 the [[DVD Forum]] approved a preliminary specification for the triple-layer 51GB HD DVD (ROM only) disc though Toshiba never stated whether it was compatible with existing HD DVD players. In September 2006 [[TDK]] announced a prototype Blu-ray Disc with a capacity of 200GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=94|title=TDK Develops Blu-ray Media with 200GB Capacity}}&lt;/ref&gt; TDK was also the first to develop a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=46TDK|title=Develops 2X, 100GB Blu-ray Disc Prototype}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 Hitachi developed a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB. Hitachi has stated that current Blu-ray drives would only require a few firmware updates in order to play the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=559|title=Hitachi Develops BD-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual-layer Blu-ray Disc release was the movie ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', which was released on October 10, 2006. As of July 2008, over 95% of Blu-ray movies/games are published on 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs with the remainder on 25&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref name="Blhu-rayStats"&gt;[http://www.blu-raystats.com/stats.php Blu-ray stats]&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of HD DVD movies are published on 30&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs, with the remainder on 15&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/releasedates_historical.html ''Frequently updated list of historical release dates and disc capacities''], HD DVD NEWS, High-Def Digest, 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdstats.com/index.php ''HD DVD Statistics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014221902/http://hddvdstats.com/index.php |date=2007-10-14 }}, HDDVDstats.com, 15 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of video compression technology (codec) complicates any comparison of the formats.  Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD both support the same three video compression standards: [[MPEG-2]], [[VC-1]] and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]], each of which exhibits different bitrate/noise-ratio curves, visual impairments/artifacts, and encoder maturity. Initial Blu-ray Disc titles often used MPEG-2 video, which requires the highest average [[bitrate]] and thus the most space, to match the picture quality of the other two video codecs. As of July 2008 over 70% of Blu-ray Disc titles have been authored with the newer compression standards: AVC and VC-1.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; HD DVD titles have used VC-1 and AVC almost exclusively since the format's introduction. [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]], which used to release movies in both formats prior to June 1, 2007, often used the same encode (with VC-1 codec) for both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, with identical results.  In contrast, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] used different encodings: initially MPEG-2 for early Blu-ray Disc releases, VC-1 for early HD DVD releases, and eventually AVC for both formats.

Whilst the two formats support similar audio codecs, their usage varies. Most titles released on the Blu-ray format include [[Dolby Digital]] tracks for each language in the region, a [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] track for all [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Sony Pictures]] and many upcoming Universal titles, [[Dolby TrueHD]] for Disney and Sony Pictures and some Paramount and Warner titles, and for many Blu-ray titles a [[Pulse-code modulation|Linear PCM]] track for the primary language.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; On the other hand, most titles released on the HD DVD format include [[Dolby Digital Plus]] tracks for each language in the region, and some also include a [[Dolby TrueHD]] track for the primary language.

===Interactivity===

Both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD have two main options for interactivity (on-screen menus, bonus features, etc.).

HD DVD's Standard Content is a minor change from standard DVD's subpicture technology, while Blu-ray's BDMV is completely new. This makes transitioning from standard DVD to Standard Content HD DVD relatively simple {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}—for example, Apple's [[DVD Studio Pro]] has supported authoring Standard Content since version 4.0.3. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} For more advanced interactivity Blu-ray disc supports [[BD-J]] while HD DVD supports [[Advanced Content]].

===Disc construction===
Blu-ray Discs contain their data relatively close to the surface (less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) which combined with the smaller spot size presents a problem when the surface is scratched as data would be destroyed. To overcome this, TDK, Sony, and Panasonic each have developed a proprietary scratch resistant surface coating. TDK [[trademark]]ed theirs as [[Durabis]], which has withstood direct abrasion by [[steel wool]] and marring with markers in tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/19/tdks-durabis-2-coating-protects-200gb-blu-ray-discs/ | title=Durabis durability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HD DVD uses traditional material and has the same scratch and surface characteristics of a regular DVD. The data is at the same depth (0.6&amp;nbsp;mm) as DVD as to minimize damage from scratching. As with DVD the construction of the HD DVD allows for a second side of either HD DVD or DVD.

A study performed by Home Media Magazine (August 5, 2007) concluded that HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are essentially equal in production cost. Quotes from several disc manufacturers for 25,000 units of HD DVDs and Blu-rays revealed a price differential of only 5-10 cents. (Lowest price: 90 cents versus 100 cents.  Highest price: $1.45 versus $1.50.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/questex/hom080507/index.php|title=Indies wait for HD - Page 1 - lists bulk prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study performed by Wesley Tech (February 9, 2007) arrived at a similar conclusion.  Quotes for 10,000 discs show that a 15 gigabyte HD DVD costs $11,500 total, and 25 gigabyte Blu-ray or a 30 gigabyte HD DVD costs $13,000 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-analyzed-again/113/ | title=Blu-ray vs HD DVD replication costs analyzed again - Lists 10,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; For larger quantities of 100,000 units, the 30 gigabyte HD DVD was more expensive than the 25 gigabyte Blu-ray ($1.55 versus $1.49).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-revealed/111/|title=Blu-ray replication vs HD DVD replication costs revealed - Lists 100,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid discs===
At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], on {{start date and age|2007|1|4|df=y|paren=y}}, [[Warner Bros.]] introduced a hybrid technology, [[Total Hi Def|Total HD]], which would reportedly support both formats on a single disc. The new discs were to overlay the Blu-ray and HD DVD layers, placing them respectively {{convert|0.1|mm|um}} and {{convert|0.5|mm|um}} beneath the surface. The Blu-ray top layer would act as a two-way mirror, reflecting just enough light for a Blu-ray reader to read and an HD DVD player to ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, however, in September 2007, Warner President Ron Sanders said that the technology was on hold due to Warner being the only company who would publish on it.&lt;ref name="Twice2007"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Warner Remains Loyal To Dual HD Formats| work = TWICE| date = 2007-09-12| url = http://www.twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| accessdate = 2008-04-25| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012191226/http://twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| archivedate = 2007-10-12| author = Tarr, Greg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the original announcement, on 4 January 2008, Warner Bros. stated that it would support the Blu-ray format exclusively beginning on 1 June 2008, which, along with the demise of HD DVD the following month, ended development of hybrid discs permanently.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Copy protection===

===Region coding===
{{Main|Blu-ray Disc#Region_codes|l1=Blu-ray Disc - Region codes}}
The Blu-ray specification and all currently available players support region coding. As of July 2008 about 66.7% of Blu-ray Disc titles are region-free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt;

The HD DVD specification had no region coding, so a HD DVD from anywhere in the world will work in any player. The DVD Forum's steering committee discussed a request from Disney to add it, but many of the 20 companies on the committee actively opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.tech.co.uk/home-entertainment/video/dvd-hdd-players-and-receivers/blu-ray-and-hd-dvd/features/microsoft-why-hd-dvd-can-beat-blu-ray | title = Microsoft: why HD DVD can beat Blu-ray |date=2007-04-03 | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some film titles that were exclusive to Blu-ray in the United States such as Sony's ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'', Fox's ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'', were released on HD DVD in other countries due to different distribution agreements; for example, ''The Prestige'' was released outside the U.S. by once format-neutral studio [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures. Since HD DVDs had no region coding, there are no restrictions playing foreign-bought HD DVDs in an HD DVD player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119267051987662923?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Blu-ray vs. HD DVD: a Solution Abroad | work = Wall Street Journal online | author = Sarah McBride |date=2007-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[35&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;film]] [[film gauge|gauge]] has long been the most common gauge in professional usage, and thus enjoys the greatest number of cameras currently available for professional usage. The modern era of 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras dates to 1972, when [[Arri]]'s [[Arriflex 35BL]] and [[Panavision]]'s original [[Panaflex]] models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger [[lens mount]] seatings secured with a [[breech lock]] – namely the [[Arri PL]] and [[PV mount]], both of which were designs descended from the [[BNCR mount]] of Mitchell cameras.

===General===
* '''Camera model''' – specific camera body models and variants, usually officially authorized
* '''Camera line''' – either the body family (similar bodies) or system family (complementary design)
* '''Manufacturer''' – company of origin
* '''Introduced''' – first year of known usage
* '''Weight''' – usually just the body, but may include accessories as mentioned
* '''MOS/Sync''' – Sync-sound cameras are able to both maintain a constant speed (usually [[crystal oscillator|crystal lock]]) and run quietly enough not to be heard by the sound recordist. [[MOS (film)|MOS]] cameras do not meet either one or both of these requirements, and are usually used either for applications where camera noise is not a concern, or non-standard camera speeds are required. A camera is also deemed MOS if it cannot hold a constant speed, regardless of its noise levels.
* '''Noise level''' – measured noise made by the camera, dB(A), with film and at a given distance from the film plane, usually one meter. MOS cameras do not have a measured noise level since they are not intended to be used with recorded sound and thus are much louder.

:''A limited number of cameras prior to the modern period are listed due to their prevalence in special applications.''

===Lens and gate aperture===
* '''Lens mount''' – the type of [[lens mount|mount]] required for using the camera. Certain lenses may not be able to be used with particular cameras if the mounts are incompatible. The lens mount must be shifted to be centered to accommodate the Super 16 format from standard 16.
* '''Aperture size''' – the size of the aperture of the gate.
* '''Aperture plate''' – is the gate removable for inspection and what accessories may it have?
* '''Lens interface''' – electronic information system located in the lens mount to communicate lens data to the camera and accessories.
* '''Ground glass''' – interchangeable [[ground glass]]es allow for the viewfinder to display whichever [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] is being framed for.
* '''Frameline glow''' – can the camera make the framelines glow for easier viewing in low-light conditions?

===Shutter===
* '''Reflex''' – is the shutter a [[reflex mirror]] design?
* '''Design''' – [[rotary disc shutter]]s have two common designs – a "half-moon" disc of 180° or "butterfly" of two e.g. 90° segments opposite each other which spin at half-speed.
* '''Location''' – where the shutter is centered
* '''Adjustment''' – how the shutter angle can be adjusted. Most manual designs can only be adjusted when the camera is not running, often with the lens removed. All electronic shutters allow adjustment at all times, including when the camera is running.
* '''Angles''' – shutter angles available and in what increments or stops, if not continuous.

===Movement===
* '''Movement type''' – design of the movement mechanism
* '''Pulldown claws''' – number of claws which engage the [[film perforations]] to transport the film while the shutter is closed. Some claws may have more than one pin in order to engage multiple perfs at a time.
* '''Registration pins''' – number of pins which engage the film perforations during exposure in order to ensure consistent image stability from frame to frame.
* '''Frame rate (forward)''' – range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Frame rate (reverse)''' – range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Motor''' – type of motor, voltage, crystal-controlled speeds ([[Crystal oscillator|Xtal]])
* '''Pulldown''' – [[negative pulldown]] options available
* '''Pitch control?''' – does the camera allow for adjustment of the pulldown claw to optimize camera noise and avoid perforation damage?

==16 mm==
[[16 mm film]] occupies a rather curious position within filmmaking – with a wide range encompassing virtually every field – amateur home movies, student films, experimental films, television work, commercials, music videos, corporate films, industrial research, medical applications, and lower budget features. Its robust image quality in relation to its size allows for a much more versatile, accessible, and affordable usage in many fields where neither 35&amp;nbsp;mm nor [[Super 8 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;8]] would be well-suited. Despite current challenges from the burgeoning digital video market, the consistent improvement of cameras, lenses, and film stocks have enabled the [[16 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;16]] format to flourish recently, with many labs reporting increased usage. The modern era of 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras is concurrent with that of 35&amp;nbsp;mm for both the same reasons as 35&amp;nbsp;mm as well as an additional change: the creation of the Super 16 format by Rune Ericsson in 1971. The format expanded the usable film negative horizontally, which required a larger [[film gate]] and necessitated either specialized conversion of machined parts or purchase of new cameras designed with Super 16 gates. Since the format took more than a decade to slowly standardize, the competition from both high and low end video cameras has decimated the demand for 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras for most non-professional usage. Therefore, there are relatively few Super 16 cameras, although most are considered professional-grade.

'''''Connections''''' is a 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary]] television series and 1978 book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]. The series was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] of the [[BBC]] Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the [[history of science]] and [[invention]], and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and [[deadpan|dry humour]]), [[historical re-enactment]]s, and intricate working [[scale model|models]].

The popular success of the series led to the production of ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997), both for [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. In 2004, [[KPJK|KCSM-TV]] produced a program called ''Re-Connections'', consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content==
[[File:Pike Square.JPG|thumb|Modern soldiers demonstrate the use of steel-tipped [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] against [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] in one of the many re-enactments used in ''Connections''.]]
''Connections'' explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and [[teleology|teleological]] view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

To demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[middle ages|medieval times]]) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode "The Long Chain" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the [[fluyt]], a type of Dutch [[cargo ship]].

Burke also explores three [[corollary|corollaries]] to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, [[Future shock|becomes too much for the average person]] to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

Lastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] or the funding of controversial projects such as [[stem cell]] research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?

The original 1978 '''''Connections''''' 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary television series]] and had a companion book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]].  The 1978 Connections companion book was published about the time the middle of the series was airing, so likely was written in parallel to the series and had a post-production editing release.&lt;ref&gt;This is not the ISBN of the original 1978 book, but those available online March 2017 via used book web sites {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions.  Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes.  It can be found in many libraries.

{{clear right}}
# "The Trigger Effect" details the world's present dependence on complex technological networks through a detailed narrative of New York City and the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|power blackout of 1965]]. Agricultural technology is traced to its origins in [[ancient Egypt]] and the invention of the [[plough]]. The segment ends in [[Kuwait]] where, because of [[Crude oil|oil]], society leapt from traditional patterns to advanced technology in a period of only about 30 years.
# "Death in the Morning" examines the standardisation of precious metal with the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from [[Greece]] to [[Persia]], ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and [[library at Alexandria]] which included [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Star catalogue|star table]]s. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators during the [[age of discovery]] 14 centuries later following the introduction of [[lateen sail]]s and [[sternpost rudder]]s. Mariners discovered that the [[compass]]'s magnetised needle did not actually point directly north. Investigations into the nature of [[magnetism]] by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Gilbert]] led to the discovery of electricity by way of the [[Electrostatic generator|sulphur ball]] of [[von Guericke]]. Further interest in [[atmospheric electricity]] at the [[Ben Nevis]] [[weather station]] led to [[C. T. R. Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[cloud chamber]] which in turn allowed development of both [[Robert Watson-Watt|Watson-Watt]]'s [[radar]] and (by way of [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s insights) [[nuclear weaponry]].
# "Distant Voices" suggests that telecommunications exist because [[Normans]] had [[stirrups]] for horse riding which in turn led them to further advancements in warfare. Deep mine shafts flooded and scientists in search of a solution examined [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuums]], air pressure, and other natural phenomena.
# "Faith in Numbers" examines the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] from the perspective of how commercialism, [[climate change]], and the [[Black Death]] influenced cultural development. He examines the impact of [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] waterpower on the Industrial Revolution, derived from [[Roman watermill]] technology such as that of the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]]. Also covered are the Gutenberg printing press, the [[Jacquard loom]], and the Hollerith punch card tabulator that led to modern computer programming.
# "The Wheel of Fortune" traces [[astrological]] knowledge in ancient Greek manuscripts from [[Baghdad]]'s founder, Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], via the Muslim monastery/medical school at [[Gundeshapur]], to the medieval Church's need for alarm clocks (the [[water clock|water horologium]] and the [[verge and foliot]] clock). The clock [[mainspring]] gave way to the [[pendulum clock]], but the latter could not be used by mariners, thus the need for [[Machine tool|precision machining]] by way of [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s improved steel (1797) and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s use (1800) of [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]]'s idea of using a screw to better measure (which he took from the [[Polelathe|turner]]'s trade). This process made a better mainspring and was also used by the Royal Navy to make better [[Block (sailing)|blocks]]. [[Honoré Blanc|Le Blanc]] mentioned this same basic idea to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who transmitted this "[[American system of manufacturing|American system of manufactures]]" – precision machine-tooling of [[musket]] parts for interchangeability – to New Englanders [[Eli Whitney]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]], and [[Simeon North]]. The American efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and his [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|psychologist wife]] later improved the whole new system of the modern [[production line]].
# "Thunder in the Skies" implicates the [[Little Ice Age]] (''[[circa]]'' 1300-1850 AD) in the invention of the [[chimney]], as well as [[knitting]], [[button]]s, [[wainscoting]], [[Tapestry|wall tapestries]], [[Plasterwork|wall plastering]], [[glass window]]s ([[Hardwick Hall]] [1597] has "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the [[steam engine]] is then examined: [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[Newcomen engine|engine]] for pumping water out of mines (1712); [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby]]'s cheap iron from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[James Watt]]'s addition of a second [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensing cylinder]] (for cooling) to the engine (1763); [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773–75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, [[Joseph Priestley]], investigated gases, leading [[Alessandro Volta]] to invent "bad air" ([[marsh gas]]) detectors and ignitors. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Drake]] discovered oil (in [[Pennsylvania]]), allowing [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] (in [[Bad Cannstatt]]) to replace [[town gas]] with gasoline as fuel for [[Siegfried Marcus|auto engine]]s (1883). They also invented (in 1892) the [[carburetor]] (inspired by the medical [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizers]], which also developed from Priestley's work) and a new ignition system inspired by Volta's "bad air" detection spark gun. Finally, piano-maker [[Wilhelm Kress]] unsuccessfully attempted (1901) to fly the first [[seaplane]] on an Austrian lake using the new gasoline engine.
# "The Long Chain" traces the invention of the [[fluyt]] freighter in Holland in the 16th century. Voyages were insured by Edward Lloyd ([[Lloyd's of London]]) if the ships' hulls were covered in pitch and tar (which came from the colonies until the American War of Independence in 1776). In [[Culross]], Scotland, [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald Cochrane (9th Earl of Dundonald)]] tried to [[coal gasification|distill coal vapour]] to get [[coal tar]] for ships' hulls, which led to the discovery of [[ammonia]]. The search for artificial [[quinine]] to treat malaria led to the development of artificial dyes, which Germany used to produce fertilizers to grow wheat and led to the advancement of chemistry which in turn led to [[DuPont]]'s discovery of polymers such as nylon.
# "Eat, Drink and Be Merry..." begins with plastic, the plastic credit card, and the concept of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], then leaps back to the time of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the first state to use credit. The [[Dukes of Burgundy|dukes]] used credit for many luxuries, and to buy more armour for a stronger army. The Swiss opposed the army of Burgundy and invented a new military formation (with [[Swiss pikemen|soldiers using pikes]]) called the [[pike square]]. The pike square, along with events following the French Revolution, set in motion the growth in the size of armies and in the use of ill-trained peasant soldiers. Feeding these large armies became a problem for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], which caused the innovation of bottled food. The bottled food was first put in champagne bottles then in tin cans. [[Canned food]] was used for armies and for navies. In one of the bottles, the canned food went bad, and people blamed the spoiled food on "bad air", also known as swamp air. Investigations around "bad air" and malaria led to the innovation of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]]. In 1892, [[Sir James Dewar]] invented a container that could keep liquids hot or cold (the [[thermos]]) which led three men – [[Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], and [[Hermann Oberth]] – to construct a large thermal flask for either [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]] or for [[solid fuel]] combustion for use in [[rocket propulsion]], applying the thermal flask principle to keep [[rocket fuel]] cold and successfully using it for the [[V-2]] rocket and the [[Saturn V rocket]] that put man on the moon.
# "Countdown" connects the invention of the [[movie projector]] to improvements in castle fortifications caused by the invention and use of the [[cannon]]. The use of the cannon caused changes in castle fortifications to eliminate a blind spot where cannon fire could not reach. This improvement in castle defence caused innovation in offensive cannon fire, which eventually required [[map]]s. Thus, a need arose to view and map locations (like a mountain top) from a long distance, which led to the invention of [[limelight]] light source, and later the [[incandescent light]]. Burke turns to the next ingredient for a movie projector, [[Photographic film|film]]. Film is made with [[celluloid]] (made with [[guncotton]]) which was first invented as a substitute for ivory in [[billiard balls]]. Next was the invention of the [[zoopraxiscope]] which was first used for a bet to see if a horse's hooves all left the ground at any point while galloping. The zoopraxiscope used frame-by-frame pictures and holes on the side to allow the machine to pull the film forward. Communication signals for railways using [[Samuel Morse|Morse]]'s telegraph led to [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] discovering how to speak into a microphone creating bumps on a disc that could be played back—the [[phonograph|record player]]. This final ingredient gave [[Sound film|movies sound]]. In summary, Burke connects the invention of the movie projector to four major innovations in history: the incandescent light, the discovery of celluloid, the projector that uses frame-by-frame pictures on celluloid, and finally, recorded sound.
# "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" recaps the theme that change causes more change. Burke ties together the modern inventions in which previous episodes had culminated: telecommunications, the computer, the jet engine, plastics, rockets, television, the production line, and the atomic bomb. All of these inventions come together in the B-52 nuclear bomber. Start with the plow, you get [[irrigation]], [[pottery]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], [[civilisation]] and writing, mathematics, a [[calendar]] to predict floods, empires, and a [[modern world]] where change happens so rapidly you cannot keep up. What do you do? Stop the change? Throw away all technology and live like cavemen? Decide what change will be allowed by law? Or just accept that the world is changing faster than we can keep up with?

===''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994)===
# "Revolutions" – What do all these things have in common—three grandfathers' lifetimes, two revolutions, 1750 [[Cornish steam engine]]s for Cornwall's tin mines, water in mines, [[pumps]], [[steam engines]], [[James Watt|Watt]]'s copier, [[carbon paper]], [[match]]es, phosphorus [[fertiliser]], trains and [[Gene pool|gene-pool]] mixing, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], 24-hour production, educated women, the telephone, high-rise buildings, [[Damascus steel|Damascus]]'s [[sword]]s, steel, diamond, [[carborundum]], [[graphite]], [[oscilloscope]], television, [[Apollo space program]], [[X-ray]] [[crystallography]], [[DNA]] and [[gene therapy]]? You will learn these things in the first episode of Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, "Revolutions".
# "Sentimental Journeys" – What do these have in common – [[Freud]], lifestyle crisis, [[electric shock therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[magnetism]], [[phrenology]], [[penology]], [[physiology]], [[synthetic dyes]], the [[Bunsen burner]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Fraunhofer lines]], [[astronomical telescope]]s, [[chromatic aberrations]], and [[surveying]]? Follow James Burke on the trail of discovering the connections between these and others in "Sentimental Journeys".
# "Getting it Together" – James Burke explains the relationship between [[hot air balloons]] and [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]], and goes on to surgery, hydraulic-water gardens, [[hydraulic rams]], [[Alpine Tunnel|tunnelling through the Alps]], the [[Orient Express]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[heart attacks]] and [[headaches]], [[aspirin]], [[carbolic acid]], [[disinfectants]], [[Maybach]]-[[Gottlieb Daimler]]-[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], [[carburetors]], [[helicopters]], [[typewriters]], [[punch cards]], and [[IBM]].
# "Whodunit?" – This episode starts with a [[billiard ball]] and ends with a billiard ball. Along the way, Burke examines [[Georgius Agricola]]'s ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', how mining supported war, the role of money, the [[Spanish Armada]], large ships, problems posed by a wood shortage, [[glass making]], coal, [[plate glass]], [[mirror]]s, the [[sextant]], the discovery of [[granite]], and seashells in the mountains, which enabled a new view of the [[age of the earth]], and [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], [[Francis Galton]]'s ''[[Eugenics]]'', and the [[fingerprinting|forensic use of fingerprints]].
# "Something for Nothing" – How do [[space shuttle]] landings start with the [[vacuum]] which was [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|forbidden by the Church]]? Burke takes us on an adventure with barometers, [[weather forecasting]], muddy and blacktop roads, rain [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[sewage]], a [[cholera]] epidemic, [[hygiene]], [[plumbing]], [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[vacuum pump]]s, [[Drill#Types|compressed-air drills]], tunnels in the Alps, [[railway air brake|train air brakes]], [[hydroelectric power]], the [[electric motor]], [[Galvani]]'s [[Muscle electrostimulation#History|muscle-electricity connection]], [[Alessandro Volta#First battery|Volta's battery]], and [[gyroscopes]].
# "Echoes of the Past" – The past in this case starts with the [[Indian tea culture#Dutch exploration|tea in Dutch-ruled India]], examines the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[porcelain]], the architecture of Florence, [[Delftware]], [[Wedgwood]], [[Free Masons]], [[Cryptography|secret codes]], [[radiotelephone|radio-telephones]], [[cosmic background radiation]] and—finally – [[radio astronomy]], which listens to "Echoes of the Past".
# "Photo Finish" – Another series of discoveries examined by Burke includes [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], the [[disappearing elephant scare of 1867]], billiard balls, [[celluloid]] as a substitute for ivory, false teeth that explode, [[gun cotton]], double shot sound of a bullet, [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[shock wave]], [[aerodynamics]], [[nuclear bombs]], [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativity]], Einstein's selenium, [[talkies|movie talkies]], the [[valve audio amplifier|vacuum tube amplifier]], radio, [[Railroad#History|railroad's use of wood]], [[coal tar]], [[gas lighting|gas lights]], [[creosote]], rubber, the [[Zeppelin]], the [[automobile]], and finally how Adeline [[Vulcanization|vulcanise]]s tires.
# "Separate Ways" – Burke shows how to get from sugar to [[atomic weapons]] by two totally independent paths. The first involves [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]], [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist societies]], [[Sampson Lloyd II]], [[wire]], [[suspension bridges]], [[Galvanization#Zinc coatings|galvanised wire]], settlement of the [[Wild West]], [[barbed wire]], canned corn, and [[cadmium]]. The second path involves [[sweet tea]], [[rum]], a [[double boiler]], the steam engine, [[Matthew Boulton]], English currency, the [[pantograph]], [[electroplating]], and [[cathode ray tubes]].
# "High Times" – The connection between [[polyethylene]] and [[Big Ben]] is a few degrees of separation, so let us recount them: polyethylene, [[radar]], soap, artificial dyes, [[color perception]], [[tapestries]], Far East goods, fake lacquer furniture, search for shorter route to Japan, [[Henry Hudson#1607 and 1608 voyages|Hudson in Greenland]], the discovery of plentiful whales, printing the Bible, [[Mercator map]], [[Martin Luther]]'s protest, star tables, Earth as a flattened sphere, and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]'s clock which of course leads to Big Ben.
# "Deja Vu" – James Burke provides evidence that history does repeat itself by examining the likes of [[black and white movie]]s, [[conquistadors]], [[Incas|Peruvian Incas]], [[small pox]], settlements that look like Spain's cities, the gold abundance ending up in [[Belgium]], Antwerp, colony [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], the practice of [[buried treasure|burying treasure]] to avoid pirates, [[Port Royal]]'s pirates, earthquakes, the [[College of William and Mary]], [[military discipline]], [[Alexander Humboldt]]'s observation on the environment, [[Ratzel]]'s superstate ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and [[Karl Haushofer|Haushofer]]'s world domination.
# "New Harmony" – A dream of utopia is followed from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] to Singapore, from the [[transistor]] to its most important element, [[germanium]], to [[Ming vase]]s and cobalt fakes (which contribute to the blue in blue tiles used in special Islamic places), and [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics in Byzantium]], the [[donation of Constantine]], [[Portuguese discoveries#Celestial navigation|Portuguese navigation by stars]], the [[History of Brazil#Beginnings of Brazil|"discovery" of Brazil]], [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|Holland's tolerance]], diamond merchants, [[optics]], [[microscopes]], beasts of science, [[Frankenstein's monster]], and finally [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony.]]
# "Hot Pickle" – Burke starts out in a [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|spice market in Istanbul]] where you can find hot pickle, recounts the [[Byzantium#History|taking of Constantinople by the Turks]] in 1453, follows the trail of pepper, tea, and [[opium]] and the exploitation of addicts, moves to the jungles of [[Java]], then to [[zoos]], the [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|use of canaries]] as carbon monoxide detectors, how [[George Stephenson]] used his consolation prize to build a [[locomotive]], which led to the [[Monitor and Merrimack|battle between the'' Monitor'' and the ''Merrimack'']]. Next we visit a sea island off the coast of South Carolina, where children of slaves are schooled. By the way, they picked cotton, which leads us to [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and [[air conditioning]]. [[Georgia Cayvan]]'s glass dress leads to the [[Neodymium laser|neodymium glass laser]], (which was used in the [[Gulf War]]). And the armed switch for firing a missile is also called a "hot pickle".
# "The Big Spin" is what [[The Big Spin|California's lottery TV show]] is called. And lottery being a game of chance, from here Burke takes us through [[Alexander Fleming]]'s chance discovery of [[penicillin]], to [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s observation that contaminated water is related to health, to [[Schliemann]]'s search for the [[City of Troy]], the theft of a discovered treasure, and to Virchow's criminology. From there we proceed to [[anthropology]], the classification of life forms, [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Mortality rate|statistics of mortality]], [[life expectancy]], [[Statistics#Statistical methods|statistical math]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]'s [[carbonated water]], the [[soda fountain]], [[petroleum oil]], some French fossil hunters, [[seismology]], and impossible-to-predict earthquakes.
# "Bright Ideas" – [[gin and tonic]] was invented to combat malaria in [[British colonies]] like [[Java]], which leads us to [[Geneva]], where cleanliness is an obsession. Here, [[tonic water]] was sealed with a disposable bottle cap, and [[disposable razor|razors became disposable]], leading us to [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s steel, invaluable for making [[clock]] springs. We take a little trip through [[lighthouses]], the education of orphans, [[psycho-physics]], the law of the [[just noticeable difference]], which is the idea behind [[stellar magnitude]]s, which leads us to discovering the [[size of the universe]].
# "Making Waves" – a [[permanent wave]] in ladies' hair is aided by [[curlers]], and this leads us to explore [[borax]], taking us to Switzerland, [[Johann Sutter]]'s scam, and [[Sutter's Mill]], and that means the discovery of gold leading to the 1848 [[California gold rush]]. Americans then cut into the English tea market with the aide of the ''[[Clipper|Yankee Clipper]]'', which played a big role in the gold rush. A fungus from America created the [[Irish potato famine]], resulting in the importing of corn, but laws prevented the Yankee clippers from being used until it was too late to save Ireland. Finally, the laws were changed, leading to franking fraud, which was overcome by special printing of postage stamps, which gave us [[wallpaper]], and a thickening agent, leading us to the [[Canal du Midi]], the [[American War of Independence|American war for independence]], resettlement in Scotland, [[Highland Clearances|highlanders]] in Nova Scotia and—finally—the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].
# "Routes" – [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], a sick English lawyer, recuperates sipping wine and contributes the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] to help fix farming problems. Farm production is not going so well in France, either. [[François Quesnay]] (doctor of King Louis XV's mistress) suggests a solution based on his complete misunderstanding of English farming techniques. ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' was his erroneous idea. It also got the people to demand social ''laissez-faire''. His inciting the public's rebellion against the [[French monarchy|monarchy]] led to France's invasion of Geneva. The [[French Revolution]] led to personal exploration of the senses. Berlin doctor Müller reasoned that each sense does a different job and the nervous system analyses what the senses are telling one. Helmholtz's pupil, Hertz, discovered that sound and electricity have a wave-like nature in common. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] takes this a step further by sending and receiving signals very long distances across the earth. The [[BBC]] realised that the radio waves were reflected by the ionosphere, and Hess was the first to suggest that the ionization was due to "Hess rays" later related to solar activity. But [[World War II]] started and [[adding machines]] were needed to aim artillery, so [[digital computing]] was invented. Thus was enabled the [[GPS]] which tells travelers their "Routes".
# "One Word" – The one word that changed everything was "[[filioque]]", but we must make a trip to [[Constantinople]], visit the [[Renaissance]], meet [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]], explore [[abbreviations]], learn about [[Italic type|Italic print]], which resulted in an overload of books, requiring the development of a cataloguing system, which was complicated for those seeking education, where [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] was innovating with pictorial textbooks. And that brings us to church intolerance, [[James Watt]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[cerium]], the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Gauss's mathematics, and [[cultural anthropology]].
# "Sign Here" – [[Murphy's Law]] says you need insurance from [[Lloyd's of London]], so pack your bags to study [[international law]] and protect yourself from piracy by calculating the probability. You better study Pascal's math for that, but you might find yourself jailed for [[free thinking]]. While you are in jail, study some [[sign language]], or at least learn to speak better than [[Eliza Doolittle]]. [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]]'s waveform recordings lead you to the telephone, the invention of [[shorthand]], the [[radiometer]], gas flow, the [[Wright brothers]]' aeroplane, [[lubrication]], [[ball bearings]] and a [[ballpoint pen]] so you can "Sign Here".
# "Better Than the Real Thing"  starts in the 1890s with bicycles and [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and then takes a look at [[boots]], [[zippers]], [[sewing machines]], and infinitesimal difference. Speaking of small, we look at microscopic [[Microorganism|germs]], [[polarized light]], sugar, coal, iron, microbubbles, the [[spectroscope]], [[night vision]], [[beriberi]] resulting from [[polished rice]], chickens, war rationing, and finally, we arrive at [[Vitamin pill|vitamins in a pill]].
# "Flexible Response" is a whimsical look at the myth of the [[English longbow]], [[Robin Hood]], sheep, the need to drain land with [[windmills]], the effect of [[compound interest]], [[decimal fractions]] (wrongly pointing to the USA not Russia as the first country with [[decimal currency]], in fact USA did not exist at the time of Russian decimalisation in 1704), increased [[productivity]], the [[Erie Canal]], railroads, [[telegraphs]], [[department stores]], [[Quaker Oats]], X-ray diagnostics, [[biofeedback]], and [[servo control]] systems in a [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft.

===''Connections³'' (1997)===
# "Feedback" – Electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by [[Claude Bernard]], whose vivisection experiments kick off animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there that are using [[Matthew Maury]]'s data on wind and currents transmitted by the radio telegraph, invented by [[Samuel Morse]], who is also a painter whose hero is [[Washington Allston]], who spends time in Italy with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who comes to [[Malta]] and spies for the governor [[Alexander Ball]], who saved Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s skin so he can go head over heels for [[Emma Hamilton]] in Naples, resulting in an illegitimate son. Emma became notable in the [[James Graham (sexologist)#The Celestial Bed|Electrico-Magnetico Celestial Bed]], where you go regain your fertility through electricity, and you can get more whisky thanks to [[Joseph Black]], who determined the latent heat of vaporisation in steam. [[James Watt]] borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper. The paper is used for decorating walls by [[William Morris]],  who is a socialist with [[Annie Besant]], who is a vegetarian just like the [[Seventh-day Adventists]]. And we end up with [[W.K. Kellogg]]'s cornflakes.
# "What's in a Name?" – Remember the cornflakes from last episode? Because corncobs make adhesives to bond [[carborundum]] discovered by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs, silicon carbide is also then used as protection against armour-piercing shells developed to hit tanks that start life as American tractors, which use diesel engines developed from funding from [[Krupp]], who inspired Bismarck's welfare scheme based on [[Adolphe Quetelet|Quetelet's]] statistics that inspired the [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], whose [[punch cards]] were used to rivet the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], the monster ship that laid the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] insulated with [[gutta-percha]] used to manufacture golf balls for factory managers in industrial Scotland, where James Watt had a run-in with [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]], whose protegee was James Macie, also called [[James Smithson]], who caused all the row in the capitol building, so the money got used to set up a world-renowned institution named after James Macie's new family name, which was Smithson: The institution known as the [[Smithsonian]].
# "Drop the Apple" – At the Smithsonian, we learn of electric crystals that help Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discover what they call radium, and then Langevin uses the piezoelectric crystal to develop sonar that helps save Liberty ships (from German U-boats) put together with welding techniques using acetylene made with carbon arcs, also working the arc lights with clockwork regulators built by Foucault, whose pendulum helps him to take pictures of solar eclipses. Also thanks to ash from seaweed, [[interchangeable parts]] for clocks, the world of opera, and gurus, we get Einstein's theory of the gravity effect, which means Newton's universe is gone and you can drop the apple.
# "An Invisible Object" – Black holes in space, seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]], brought into space with hydrazine fuel, which was a byproduct of fungicides for French vines, fuelled by quarantine conventions and money orders, [[American Express]] and [[Buffalo Bill]], Vaudeville and French battles, [[Joan of Arc]] and the Inquisition, Jews welcomed by Turks, who lost to Maltese knights with surgeons trained on pictures by [[Titian]], in [[Augsburg]], where goldsmiths made French money to pay for tobacco. That triggered logarithms and slide rules made by clock makers, who also made pressure cookers that sterilised French beer kept cool by refrigerators that were also used to freeze meat and chill down paraffin wax for making objects invisible.
# "Life is No Picnic" – Instant coffee gets off the ground in World War II and Jeeps lead to nylons and stocking machines smashed by [[Luddites]], who were defended by [[Lord Byron]], who meets [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Turkey, avoiding the same blockade that inspires the "Star-Spangled Banner", which was really an English song all about a Greek poet discovered by a publisher whose son-in-law is pals with [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] of chronology fame, whose military boss, Maurice, inspires [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]], father of the runaway [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], whose teacher [[René Descartes]]' mechanical universe inspires the book about brains by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Willis]], which is illustrated by the architect of St. Paul's, [[Christopher Wren]], who dabbles in investments like [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s Louisiana scam that ruins France, and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and later the French finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], whose daughter is the opinionated [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|de Stael]], whose romantic pals get [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] looking into jellyfish so he can defend [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. This demonstrates that "Life is No Picnic".
# "Elementary Stuff" – [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who studied beetles, [[Oliver Lodge]] and telegraphy, a radio designed by [[Reginald Fessenden]], which was used by banana growers, studied by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]], who got the Swiss to use stamps on postcards with cartoons of Gothic houses of parliament, which in turn had been inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s Romantic movement, inspired by fake Scottish poems. The exiled Scots escaped to North Carolina, producing turpentine, which helped make Chinese lacquer on tinplate, which is for what [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] had hoped. French navy decorator [[Pierre Paul Puget]], who paints pictures of locations where barometers are the subject of investigation. The weather experimenter, whose brother's writing turns on Swift, whose pal Berkeley has visual theories that Young confirms while decoding ancient Egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by French balloonists. The American balloons are used for spying by [[Allan Pinkerton]] and his intrepid agent [[James McParland]], who becomes famous in England because of [[Conan Doyle]].
# "A Special Place" – Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffries]] of Leicester University in England develops DNA profiling and schlieren photography used by [[Theodore von Karman]] to study aerodynamics and [[Anthony Fokker]]'s airborne machine guns and the [[Red Baron]] and geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s romantic ideas that start in Italy and paintings of actors and lighthouses and the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] and Spanish gold and [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] and [[William Cheselden]]'s skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing aficionados who write books and [[Charles Cotton]] and sceptical wine-drinkers called [[Michel Eyquem]], and [[Edward Jenner]]'s cure for smallpox and [[J.J. Audubon]] and American bird painters and devious Russian real estate deals, and as a result in 1872, America gets a special place, the first national park, Yellowstone.
# "Fire from the Sky" –   Due to [[continental drift]] and [[Alfred Wegener]]'s passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of [[King Arthur]], whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval [[courtly love]] answers to adultery, which were in turn inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical [[Catharism|Cathars]], who lived next to the mystical [[Christian Kabbalah|cabalists]] who were fascinated with mystic numbers that spark [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Pico of Mirandola]]'s interest in Hebrew, which then brings trouble for [[Johann Reuchlin]], not helped by his nephew, the [[Protestant]] [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], who had a feud with [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]], who rewrites the work of [[Copernicus]]. Osiander's Italian pal, Dr. [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], who cures the asthmatic [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], executed for helping [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], whose lover, the explosive-bearing [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], ends up in Scandinavia with a friend of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], whose assistant, [[Willem Blaeu]], makes maps updated in the first true atlas by the Englishman Dudley, working in Italy for [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], who got opera started, which was a rave success, especially with the French [[Cardinal Mazarin]], whose library inspired [[Samuel Pepys|the secretary of the English navy]], which eventually buys French [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], after which [[Canning|Gamble]] gets the patent for canned food that feeds explorers like [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], who transplanted rubber trees to [[Sri Lanka]]. As a result of all that, we have rubber to mix with gasoline to make [[napalm]], which is "Fire from the Sky".
# "Hit the Water" – Thanks to napalm, made with [[palm oil]], also used for [[margarine]], stiffened with a process using [[kieselguhr]] that comes from [[plankton]] living in currents studied by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Ballot]] before observing the [[Doppler effect]] that caused [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] to measure the speed of light. Fizeau's father-in-law's friend, [[Prosper Mérimée]], who wrote "[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]"...&amp;nbsp;his friend, [[Anthony Panizzi]], who works at the British Museum, opened to house the collection of [[Hans Sloane]], who treats Lady Montague's smallpox before she sees Turkish tulips, first drawn by Gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with France, which was the first to develop military music and choreography, used in a London show by [[John Gay]], whose friend Arbuthnot does statistics that impress the Dutch mathematician who knows [[Voltaire]], who hears from the worm-slicing [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who stars in the story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Judge Hoffman]], who tries German nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the [[YMCA]] and the man who started the [[Red Cross]], who need a way to figure out blood types, surgical stitching and the perfusion pump invented by [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to [[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']], [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']], and the German invasion of Norway and the Allied commandos whose mission was to "Hit the Water".
# "In Touch" – Starting from an attempt for cheaper fusion power using superconductivity, which was discovered by Onnes, with liquid gas provided by [[Louis-Paul Cailletet]], who carried out experiments on a [[Eiffel Tower|tower]] built by [[Gustave Eiffel]], who also built the [[Statue of Liberty]] with its famous poem by the Jewish activist [[Emma Lazarus]], helped by [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Oliphant]], whose boss Elgin was the son of the man who stole the [[Elgin Marbles]] and sold them with the help of royal painter [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose colleague [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] had an assistant whose wife's lodger was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who charted the [[Gulf Stream]] with a thermometer [[Fahrenheit]] borrowed from [[Ole Rømer]], whose friend [[Jean Picard|Picard]] surveyed Versailles and provided the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspired [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel]] to write the book on gardening that was read by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], who hired the Scottish stonemason [[Thomas Telford]], whose idea for [[London Bridge]] was turned down by Thomas Young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do Hertz's electricity waves, with which Helmholtz prods a frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, Klages, analyses handwriting so individual post codes have to be capital letters to get your mail to a jungle village to keep you "In Touch".

==Related works==
All three ''Connections'' documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.

Burke also wrote a series of ''Connections'' articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and published a book of the same name (1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.

Burke produced another documentary series called ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original ''Connections''.

''{{YouTube|user=ArtOfTheProblem|title=Art of the Problem}}'' is a video series launched in 2011 on [[Kickstarter.com]] that was inspired by James Burke's ''Connections''. However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.

''[[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]]'', shown on [[BBC2]], follows a similar format.

===In video games===
''Connections'', a ''[[Myst]]''-style computer game with James Burke and others providing video footage and voice acting, was released in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/connections Connections – MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a runner-up for ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s award for the best "Classics/Puzzles" game of 1995, which ultimately went to ''[[You Don't Know Jack (1995 video game)|You Don't Know Jack]]''. The editors wrote of ''Connections'', "That you enjoy yourself so much you hardly realize that you're learning is a tribute to the design."&lt;ref name=cgw1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff |title=The Computer Gaming World 1996 Premier Awards |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=143 |date=June 1996 |pages=55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clip from the episode "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" appears in the 2016 video game [[The Witness (2016 video game)|The Witness]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">'''Cycle of quantification/qualification''' (C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;) is a parameter used in [[real-time polymerase chain reaction]] techniques, indicating the cycle number where a PCR amplification curve meets a predefined mathematical criterion. A C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; may be used for quantification of the target sequence or to determine whether the target sequence is present or not.

Two criteria to determine the  C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are used by different thermocyclers:
Cycle of Threshold (CT) is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a given value threshold. Usually, the threshold is set above the baseline, about 10 times the [[standard deviation]] of the noise of the baseline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gene-quantification.com/real-time-pcr-handbook-life-technologies-update-flr.pdf |format=PDF |title=Life Technologies : Real-time PCR handbook |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid random effects on the CT. However, the threshold shouln't be set much higher than that to avoid reduced reproducibility due to uncontrolled factors. 
Crossing point (Cp)  and Take off point (TOP) are the cycle value of the maximum second derivative of the amplification curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/20/e122.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Standardized determination of real-time PCR effciency from a single reaction set-up |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=2003 |volume=31 |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |accessdate=2015-09-27 |doi=10.1093/nar/gng122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:FD1771 FDC Datasheet.jpg|thumb|A floppy disk controller datasheet.]]

A '''datasheet''', '''data sheet''', or '''spec sheet''' is a [[document]] that summarizes the performance and other technical characteristics of a product, machine, component (e.g., an [[electronic component]]), material, a subsystem (e.g., a [[power supply]]) or [[software]] in sufficient detail that allows design engineer to understand the role of the component in the overall system. Typically, a datasheet is created by the manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the [[wikt:connectivity|connectivity]] of the devices. In cases where there is relevant [[source code]] to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file.

Depending on the specific purpose, a datasheet may offer an [[average]] value, a typical value, a typical range, [[tolerance (engineering)|engineering tolerances]], or a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the datasheet.

A datasheet is usually used for [[technical communication]] to describe technical characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical [[specification]] is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.

An electronic datasheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure that allows the information to be processed by a machine. Such machine readable descriptions can facilitate information retrieval, display, design, testing, interfacing, verification, and system discovery. Examples include [[transducer electronic data sheet]]s for describing sensor characteristics, and [[CANopen#Electronic Device Description|Electronic device descriptions in CANopen]] or descriptions in markup languages, such as [[SensorML]].

==Typical electronics datasheet information==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2017}}
Examples include:

===Electronic component===
A typical datasheet for an electronic component contains most of the following information:	
* Manufacturer's name
* Product number and name
* List of available package formats (with images) and ordering codes
* Notable device properties
* Short functional description
* Pin connection diagram
* Absolute minimum and maximum ratings (supply voltage, power consumption, input currents, temperatures for storage, operating, soldering, etc.)
* Recommended operating conditions (as absolute minimum and maximum ratings)
* [[Direct current|DC]] specifications (various temperatures, supply voltages, input currents, etc.)
* Maximum power consumption over the whole operating temperature range
* [[Alternating current|AC]] specifications (various temperatures, supply voltages, frequencies, etc.)
* Input/output wave shape diagram
* [[digital timing diagram|timing diagram]]
* Some characteristics are only given at a specific temperature, typically 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F)
* Physical details showing minimum/typical/maximum dimensions, contact locations and sizes
* Ordering codes for differing packages and performance criteria
* Liability [[disclaimer]] regarding device use in certain environments such as [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[life support]] systems
* Application recommendations, such as required [[filter capacitor]]s, circuit board layout, etc.
* Errata, often published prior to subsequent correction and relevant datasheet revision

===Personal computer===
* Number of ports
** [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[S/PDIF]], [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]], [[Serial port|Serial]], [[Parallel port|Parallel]]
* Expansion bays
** 5.25&amp;nbsp;inch bays
** 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch bays
* Motherboard
** [[CPU socket]]
*** [[Front-side bus]] (FSB)
*** [[Back-side bus]] (BSB)
** [[Chipset]]
*** [[Northbridge (computing)|North bridge]]
*** [[Southbridge (computing)|South bridge]]
** [[Random-access memory]] (RAM) slots
** [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) and [[PCI Express]] (PCIe) buses and slots
** [[Floppy disk|Floppy]], [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] ([[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]]) and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] interfaces
** Fans and temperature monitoring
** Integrated [[graphics controller]]s
** Integrated [[Local Area Network|LAN]] interfaces
** Firmware ([[BIOS]])
** Form factor
* Graphics card
** [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] type
** Memory
* Audio card
* [[Hardware compatibility list|Hardware compatibility]] requirements and basic setup details for computer [[device driver]]s
* [[Operating system]] and other installed [[software]] (if included)

Although a datasheet may include a "typical use" circuit diagram, as well as programming examples in the case of programmable devices, this sort of information is often published in a separate '''application note''', with a high level of detail.

Historically, datasheets were typically available in a '''databook''' that contained many datasheets, usually grouped by manufacturer or general type. Today, they are also available through the Internet in table form or via downloadable (usually [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) documents.

==Chemical data sheets==

===Material Safety Data Sheets===
A [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] (MSDS), Safety Data Sheet (SDS), or Product Safety Data Sheet (PSDS) is an important component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. It provides workers with ways to allow them to work in a safe manner and gives them physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.

The SDSs are a commonly used classification for logging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. The SDSs often include the safe use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical. Anytime chemicals are used these data sheets will be found.

There is a need to have an internationally recognized symbol when describing hazardous substances. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background, used to denote a harmful substance.

The purpose of an SDS is not so that the general public will have a knowledge of how to read and understand it, but more so that it can be used in an occupational setting to allow workers to be able to work with it.

===Chemical data===
Data sheets and pages are available for specific properties of chemicals in [[Chemical elements data references]]: example, [[Melting points of the elements (data page)]].  Specific materials have technical data in individual sheets such as [[Ethanol (data page)]]: this includes subjects such as structure and properties, thermodynamic properties, spectral data, vapor pressure, etc. Other chemical data sheets are available from individual producers of chemicals, often on their web pages.

==Data sheets for automobiles==
Data sheets for automobiles may be described under several names such as features, specs, engineering data, technical summary, etc.  They help communicate the technical information about a car to potential buyers and are useful for comparisons with similar cars.  They might include:  critical inside and outside dimensions, weight, fuel efficiency, engine and drive train, towing capability, safety features and options, warranty, etc.

== Similar Documents ==
* '''[[Brochure]]''' focuses more on the benefits and advantages of a products, and states less details, especially less quantitative parameters to describe the product. The beginning parts of a brochure and a datasheet for the same product may look the same and include the name of the product, manufacturer's name, logo and contact details, brief description, photo of scheme of the product.
* '''[[Trade literature#Catalog|Catalog]]''' presents a variety of products and in comparison to datsheets, that presents one product or a relatively small group of similar products. Catalog may present many of the parameters that are stated in the datasheets of the products, but usually catalogs are not as comprehensive as datasheets. 
* '''[[User guide]]''' deals more with the step-by-step usage of a products, and may include a brief or complete list of parameters that describe the product, usually as an appendix for the actual user guide document.
* '''Application notes''' is a document that gives more specific details on using a component in a specific application, or relating to a particular process (e.g., the physical assembly of a product containing the component). Application notes are especially useful for giving guidance on more unusual uses of a particular component, which would be irrelevant to many readers of the more widely read datasheet. application notes may either be appended to a datasheet, or presented as a separate document.
* A '''technical specification''' is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1614">A '''discrete system''' is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to [[computational theory]]. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise [[mathematical models]].

A [[computer]] is a [[finite state machine]] that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at [[discrete time]] intervals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">'''Enhanced Observed Time Difference''' ('''E-OTD''') is a standard for the location of [[mobile telephone]]s. The location method works by [[multilateration]]. The standardisation was first carried out for [[GSM]] by the GSM standard committees (T1P1.5 and ETIS) in LCS Release 98 and Release 99.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/workshop/Archive/0101LCS/Docs/PDF/LCS-010019.pdf “Overview of 2G LCS Technologies and Standards”]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation was continued for [[3G]] and [[WCDMA]] mobile telephones by 3GPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmworld.com/contents/pdf/6623767.pdf “Testing E-ODT” (Manual for the E-ODT compliance check)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, the method is similar to [[U-TDOA]], however, it involves time difference measurements being made in the handset rather than the network, and a mechanism to pseudo-synchronise the network. The handset makes an observation of the time difference of arrival of signals from two different base stations. These observations are known as Observed Time Difference (OTD). The handset measures the OTD between a number of different base stations. If the base stations were synchronised, then a single OTD defines a hyperbolic locus. A second, independent OTD, for which one of the observed base stations is spatially distinct from those in the first OTD, would provide a second hyperbolic locus, and the intersection of the two loci gives an estimate of the location of the mobile. If more than two independent OTDs are available, then the measurements can be combined to yield a more accurate measurement.

However, GSM and 3G networks are not necessarily synchronised, so further information is needed. The E-OTD standard provides a method for pseudo-synchronisation. A Location Measurement Unit (LMU) can be used to estimate the transmission time offset between two base stations. This measurement is known as the Real Time Difference (RTD). The RTD for two base stations can then be subtracted from the OTD for the same two base stations to produce the Geometric Time Difference (GTD). The GTD is the time difference that would have been measured by the mobile if the network was perfectly synchronised. Accordingly, the application of the RTD provides a pseudo-synchronisation.

An LMU is a receiver that is placed in a position in the network that is able to report the RTDs of a number of different base stations. If the base station clocks are not synchronised to a common source, then it is necessary to continuously update the RTDs, as the time offsets will be changing due to the clock drift in each base station.&lt;ref&gt;“Mobile Phone Location Determination and Its Impact on Intelligent Transportation Systems” IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. Vol 1, No. 1, pp 
55 – 64, March, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of LMUs can be expensive, and so is a drawback of E-OTD. However, a 2003 paper&lt;ref&gt;“Mobile location without network-based synchronization or How to do E-OTD without LMUs”. Proc. SPIE. Vol. 5084, 59 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; describes a method of operating E-OTD without LMUs, and presents results of an operational trial. In essence, if there are sufficient independent OTD measurements such that the equation system is over-determined, then the additional information can be used to estimate the RTDs.

E-OTD was considered for the [[Enhanced 911]] mandate, but ultimately was not a successful contender for this application. An active proponent and developer of E-OTD was Cambridge Positioning Systems (CPS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-928153.html “Last Chance for E911 Technology”]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CPS was acquired by [[CSR plc|CSR]]. In 2009, CSR merged with [[CSR plc|SIRF]].

Because E-OTD requires a software modification to be included in the mobile phone, E-OTD positioning system has been less commonly used than the [[U-TDOA]] positioning system.

'''EchoStar Mobile''' was set up in 2008 as Solaris Mobile, a joint venture company between [[SES S.A.|SES]] and [[Eutelsat]] Communications to develop and commercialize the first [[geostationary]] [[satellite]] systems in Europe for broadcasting video, radio and data to in-vehicle receivers and to mobile devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=SES ASTRA|date=February 21, 2008|url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2008/4461735|title=Steve Maine Appointed By SES ASTRA And EUTELSAT As CEO Of Joint Venture For Mobile Satellite Services |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as mobile phones, [[portable media player]]s and [[PDA]]s. In January 2014 all stock in Solaris Mobile was acquired by [[EchoStar Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile|date=January 6, 2014|url=http://www.solarismobile.com/media/press-releases/echostar_acquires_european_mobile_satellite_services_provider|title=Echostar Acquires European Mobile Satellite Services Provider |accessdate = October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2015 the company was renamed EchoStar Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=EchoStar|date=March 25, 2015|url=http://www.echostar.com/NewsEvents/PressReleases/PressRelease.aspx?prid=11363|title=Solaris Mobile is Now EchoStar Mobile
|accessdate = March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement to set up Solaris Mobile was reached in 2006 with the company formed in 2008. SES and Eutelsat – both successful European satellite operators, providing TV and other services from geostationary satellites to millions of cable and [[direct-to-home]] viewers – invested €130m in the venture. The services to be developed included video, radio, multimedia data, interactive services, and voice communications, with the primary aim of delivering mobile television any time, anywhere. Its headquarters is in [[Dublin]], in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Solaris Mobile's first commercial contract was with Italian media publishing group [[Class Editori]], to launch a digital radio service in Italy. A hybrid satellite/terrestrial network will initially be deployed in Milan, in October 2011 and extended across the country in 2012. Solaris claims that the network will enable Italians to access dozens of new digital radio channels broadcasting music, news, entertainment and sports, in their original format with continuity of reception across the entire country, and that the digital audio signal will be complemented with new visual media services such as programme information and traffic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile|date=July 12, 2011 |url=http://www.solarismobile.com/media/news/solaris-mobile-and-class-editori-sign-agreement-to-launch-digital-radio-service-in-italy|title=SOLARIS MOBILE AND CLASS EDITORI SIGN AGREEMENT TO LAUNCH DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE IN ITALY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The EU Telecoms Commissioner, Viviane Reding, has commented, "Mobile satellite services have huge potential: they can enable Europeans to access new communication services, particularly in rural and less populated regions."&lt;ref name="ec press"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=European Commission |date=May 14, 2009 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/770 |title=European Commission paves the way for European mobile satellite services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris Mobile primarily intends to provide mobile TV and interactive services to handheld and vehicle receivers. For in-vehicle use, the mobile satellite receivers could also double as web browsers providing full Internet access, and deliver interactive services such as online reservations, emergency warnings, or toll payments.

Solaris claims the technology brings a "fully-fledged TV experience" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarismobile.com/our-solutions/mobile-tv/ ''Broadcasting in motion'']. Solaris Mobile website. Retrieved on June 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to mobile television, unavailable with purely terrestrial systems, delivering high-quality live TV, viable at high vehicle speeds, dozens of TV channels per country, and universal coverage.

The coverage across Europe will also enable the system to be used for situations when other means of communication are not possible, such as gathering data (traffic, weather, pollution) from moving vehicles, and support for emergency and rescue services in isolated regions, under extreme conditions or when terrestrial networks have been compromised.

To avoid the requirement for mobile phones with S-band reception for the satellite services, Solaris Mobile has developed a 'Pocket Gateway' in conjunction with Finnish company Elekrobit. The Gateway is a compact S-band receiver which decodes DVB-SH transmissions from the Solaris satellite and relays them over WiFi to any compatible handset with a web browser. The Gateway is also planned to be used in vehicles with a roof-mounted antenna for S-band reception with services accessed on passengers' mobile phones. The technology was demonstrated at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile|date=February 10, 2010|url=http://www.solarismobile.com/media-center/press-releases/pocket-gateway-device |title=Pocket Gateway Device}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The Solaris Mobile services use [[DVB-SH]] technology to deliver IP based data and media content to handheld and in-vehicle terminals using a hybrid satellite/terrestrial system with satellite transmission serving the whole of Europe and beyond, and terrestrial repeaters for urban and indoor penetration.

The [[S-band]] frequencies used (2.00&amp;nbsp;GHz) are reserved for the exclusive use of satellite and terrestrial mobile services, and sit alongside the [[UMTS]] frequencies already in use across Europe for [[3G]] terrestrial mobile phone services, allowing the reuse of existing cellular towers and antennas, and the simple incorporation of Solaris services in mobile handsets.

Handsets equipped with the first DVB-SH chipsets were successfully demonstrated live at the ''Mobile World Congress'' in Barcelona in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS186611+06-Feb-2008+PRN20080206  Major Players of the DVB-SH Ecosystem Join Forces to Demonstrate Live Mobile TV]. Reuters (February 6, 2008). Retrieved on June 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris was intended to first use the Eutelsat [[W series (satellites)|W2A]] satellite at 10° east, which contains an S-band payload, and was scheduled for launch in early 2009. However, following the successful launch on April 3, 2009, the S-band payload was found to show "an anomaly" which has put in doubt the payload's capability to provide mobile satellite services for Solaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile |date=May 14, 2009 |url= http://www.solarismobile.com/assets/downloads/Statement%20re%20Solaris%20Mobile%20S-band%20capacity_en.pdf |title= Statement re Solaris Mobile S-band capacity}} [http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2009/4470775 SES ''Statement on Solaris Mobile S-band capacity'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Further testing of the satellite was undertaken to establish its future in the Solaris programme. Investigation of S-band payload has confirmed significant non-compliance from its original specifications. On 1 July 2009, Solaris Mobile filed an insurance claim. The technical findings indicate that the company should be able to offer some, but not all of the services it was planning to offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile |date=July 1, 2009 |url=http://www.solarismobile.com/assets/downloads/SolarisMobileFilesInsuranceClaim.pdf |title=Solaris Mobile Files Insurance Claim}} [http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2009/4468872 SES statement: ''Solaris Mobile Files Insurance Claim'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory==
On June 30, 2008 the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council|Council]] adopted the European’s Decision to establish a single selection and authorisation process to ensure a coordinated introduction of mobile satellite services (MSS) in Europe. The selection process was launched in August 2008 and attracted four applications by prospective operators ([[ICO Global Communications|ICO]], [[Inmarsat]], Solaris Mobile, [[TerreStar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=European Commission |date=August 22, 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1243 |title=Commission boost for mobile satellite services paves the way for EU-wide high speed data communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=European Commission |date=August 7, 2008 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1250 |title=New Satellites for Europe: Commission starts selection procedure for operators of pan-European mobile satellite services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the [[European Commission]] selected two operators, [[Inmarsat]] Ventures and Solaris Mobile, giving these operators "the right to use the specific radio frequencies identified in the Commission's decision and the right to operate their respective mobile satellite systems". EU Member States now have to ensure that the two operators have the right to use the specific radio frequencies identified in the Commission's decision and the right to operate their respective mobile satellite systems for 18 years from the selection decision. The operators are compelled to start operations within 24 months from the selection decision.&lt;ref name="ec press"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=European Commission |date=May 14, 2009 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/237 |title=Mobile Satellite Services in Europe: Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSBRQ00733920090514 ''Inmarsat and Solaris win EU spectrum rights''] Reuters (May 14, 2009). Retrieved July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/current/pan_european/index_en.htm ''Pan-European numbers and services'']. European Commission ''Information Society'' website. Retrieved July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the EU’s decision was announced days after the apparent failure of the payload intended to serve Solaris, the company remains confident of "its ability to meet the commitments made under the European Commission selection process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile |date=May 14, 2009 |url=http://www.solarismobile.com/assets/downloads/Solaris%20Mobile%20welcomes%20the%20European%20Commission%20selection%20decision%20for%20the%20S-%20Band%20process_en.pdf |title=Solaris Mobile welcomes the European Commission selection decision for the S-band process}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Solaris Mobile announced that following the granting of spectrum by the European Commission, the company had been actively pursuing licenses from European member states and it had just been granted 18-year licences to operate Mobile Satellite Services in France, Sweden and Germany, to add to existing licenses for Finland, Luxembourg, Italy, and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Solaris Mobile|date=May 11, 2010|url= http://www.solarismobile.com/media-center/press-releases/european-license-progress |title= European License Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extensible Forms Description Language''' ('''XFDL''') is a high-level [[computer language]] that facilitates defining a form as a single, stand-alone object using elements and attributes from [[XML| the Extensible Markup Language (XML)]]. Technically, it is a class of XML originally specified in a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-XFDL-19980902 Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL) 4.0], W3C Note, 2 SEP 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  See Specifications below for links to the current versions of XFDL.  XFDL It offers precise control over form layout, permitting replacement of existing business/government forms with electronic documents in a human-readable, [[open standard]].

In addition to precision layout control, XFDL provides multiple page capabilities, step-by-step guided user experiences, and [[digital signature]]s.  XFDL also provides a syntax for in-line mathematical and conditional expressions and data validation constraints as well as custom items, options, and external code functions.  Current versions of XFDL (see Specifications below) are capable of providing these interactive features via open standard markup languages including XForms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xforms-20091020/ XForms 1.1], W3C Recommendation, 20 OCT 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; XPath,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116 XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0], W3C Recommendation, 16 NOV 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; XML Schema&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/ XML Schema Part 1: Structures Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004;
[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/ XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and XML Signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/ XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition)], W3C Recommendation, 10 JUN 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

XFDL not only supports multiple digital signatures, but the signatures can apply to specific sections of a form and prevent changes to signed content.

These advantages to XFDL led large organizations such as the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] to migrate to XFDL from using forms in other formats. Later, though, the lack of portable software capable of creating XFDL led them to investigate moving away from it. The Army migrated to [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] fillable [[PDF]]s in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://armypubs.army.mil/news/Memo_Army_Migrating_to_Adobe_Fillable_Forms_10Jul13_Redacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">A '''fiber optic display''' is a light-emitting display that uses [[fiber optic]]s to display images, text, and notification lights. Fiber-optic displays can either be static or dynamic, with the typical lighting source being [[halogen light bulb]]s.

==Static fiber optic displays==
Static fiber optic displays have been commonly used for some types of [[traffic signal]]s.  One common use for static fiber optic displays are [[lane control lights]], which display either a green downward-pointing arrow or a red X to indicate the open/closed status of road lanes.

==Dynamic fiber optic displays==
Dynamic fiber optic displays typically display alphanumeric text, and utilize electromechanical shutters to open or close the ends of the fiber strands to display an alphanumeric pixel.  These type of displays were commonly used as [[variable-message sign]]s on highways.  Compared to [[eggcrate display]]s, dynamic fiber optic displays offered lower energy consumption due to requiring fewer bulbs, and offered improved nighttime legibility.  For daytime legibility, they were sometimes combined with [[flip-disc display]]s to be reflective in daylight and emissive at night.

The '''frog galvanoscope''' was a sensitive electrical instrument used to detect [[voltage]]&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It consists of skinned frog's leg with electrical connections to a nerve.  The instrument was invented by [[Luigi Galvani]] and improved by [[Carlo Matteucci]].

The frog galvanoscope, and other experiments with frogs played a part in the dispute between Galvani and [[Alessandro Volta]] over the nature of electricity.  The instrument is extremely sensitive and continued to be used well into the nineteenth century, even after [[electromechanical]] meters came into use.

==Terminology==
Synonyms for this device include '''galvanoscopic frog''', '''frog's leg galvanoscope''', '''frog galvanometer''', '''rheoscopic frog''', and '''frog electroscope'''.  The device is properly called a ''galvanoscope'' rather than ''galvanometer'' since the latter implies accurate measurement whereas a galvanoscope only gives an indication.&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"&gt;Hackmann, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern usage a [[galvanometer]] is a sensitive laboratory instrument for measuring current, not voltage.  Everyday current meters for use in the field are called [[ammeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar distinction can be made between [[electroscope]]s, [[electrometer]]s, and [[voltmeter]]s for voltage measurements.

==History==
Frogs were a popular subject of experiment in the laboratories of early scientists.  They are small, easily handled, and there is a ready supply.  [[Marcello Malpighi]], for instance, used frogs in his study of lungs in the seventeenth century.  Frogs were particularly suitable for the study of muscle activity.  Especially in the legs, the muscle contractions are readily observed and the nerves are easily dissected out.  Another desirable feature for scientists was that these contractions continued after death for a considerable time.  Also in the seventeenth century, [[Leopoldo Caldani]] and [[Felice Fontana]] subjected frogs to electric shocks to test [[Albrecht von Haller]]'s [[Hallerian physiology|irritability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luigi Galvani]], a lecturer at the [[University of Bologna]], was researching the [[nervous system]] of frogs from around 1780.  This research included the muscular response to [[opiate]]s and [[static electricity]], for which experiments the spinal cord and rear legs of a frog were dissected out together and the skin removed.  In 1781,&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; an observation was made while a frog was being so dissected.  An [[Electrostatic generator|electric machine]] discharged just at the moment one of Galvani's assistants touched the [[crural nerve]] of a dissected frog with a scalpel.  The frog's legs twitched as the discharge happened.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani found that he could make the prepared leg of a frog (see the [[#Construction|''Construction'']] section) twitch by connecting a metal circuit from a nerve to a muscle, thus inventing the first frog galvanoscope.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani published these results in 1791 in ''De viribus electricitatis''.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version of the story of the frog response at a distance has the frogs being prepared for a soup on the same table as a running electric machine.  Galvani's wife notices the frog twitch when an assistant accidentally touches a nerve and reports the phenomenon to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This story originates with [[Jean-Louis Alibert]] and, according to Piccolino and Bresadola, was probably invented by him.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 5, citing [[Adolphe Ganot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galvani, and his nephew [[Giovanni Aldini]], used the frog galvanoscope in their electrical experiments.  [[Carlo Matteucci]] improved the instrument and brought it to wider attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani used the frog galvanoscope to investigate and promote the theory of ''animal electricity'', that is, that there was a [[vitalism|vital life force]] in living things that manifested itself as a new kind of electricity.  [[Alessandro Volta]] opposed this theory, believing that the electricity that Galvani and other proponents were witnessing was due to metal [[contact electrification]] in the circuit.  Volta's motivation in inventing the [[voltaic pile]] (the forerunner of the common [[zinc–carbon battery]]) was largely to enable him to construct a circuit entirely with non-biological material to show that the vital force was not necessary to produce the electrical effects seen in animal experiments.  Matteucci, in answer to Volta, and to show that metal contacts were not necessary, constructed a circuit entirely out of biological material, including a [[frog battery]].  Neither the animal electricity theory of Galvani nor the contact electrification theory of Volta forms part of modern electrical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199|Clarke &amp; O'Malley, p. 186|Hellman, pp. 31–32|Bird (1848), pp. 344–345|Matteucci (1845), pp.284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Alan Hodgkin]] in the 1930s showed that there is indeed an [[ion]]ic current flowing in nerves.&lt;ref name=Picc75&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteucci used the frog galvanoscope to study the relationship of electricity to muscles, including in freshly amputated human limbs.  Matteucci concluded from his measurements that there was an electric current continually flowing from the interior, to the exterior of all muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Matteucci's idea was widely accepted by his contemporaries, but this is no longer believed and his results are now explained in terms of [[injury potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
An entire frog's hind leg is removed from the frog's body with the [[sciatic nerve]] still attached, and possibly also a portion of the [[spinal cord]].  The leg is skinned, and two electrical connections are made.  These may be made to the nerve and the foot of the frog's leg by wrapping them with metal wire or foil,&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"&gt;Hare, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but a more convenient instrument is Matteucci's arrangement shown in the image.  The leg is placed in a glass tube with just the nerve protruding.  Connection is made to two different points on the nerve.&lt;ref name=Bird345&gt;Bird, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matteucci, the instrument is most accurate if direct electrical contact with muscle is avoided.  That is, connections are made only to the nerve.  Matteucci also advises that the nerve should be well stripped and that contacts to it can be made with wet paper in order to avoid using sharp metal probes directly on the nerve.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; O'Malley, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
When the frog's leg is connected to a circuit with an [[electric potential]], the muscles will contract and the leg will twitch briefly.  It will twitch again when the circuit is broken.&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"/&gt;  The instrument is capable of detecting extremely small [[voltage]]s, and could far surpass other instruments available in the first half of the nineteenth century, including the electromagnetic [[galvanometer]] and the [[gold-leaf electroscope]].  For this reason, it remained popular long after other instruments became available.  The galvanometer was made possible in 1820 by the discovery by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] that electric currents would deflect a compass needle, and the gold-leaf electroscope was even earlier ([[Abraham Bennet]], 1786).&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Golding Bird]] could still write in 1848 that "the irritable muscles of a frog's legs were no less than 56,000 times more delicate a test of electricity than the most sensitive condensing electrometer."&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 345 citing Wilkinson, 1845&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''condenser'' used by Bird here means a coil, so named by [[Johann Poggendorff]] by analogy with Volta's term for a [[Capacitor#Condenser|capacitor]].&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"/&gt;

The frog galvanoscope can be used to detect the direction of [[electric current]].  A frog's leg that has been somewhat desensitised is needed for this.  The sensitivity of the instrument is greatest with a freshly prepared leg and then falls off with time, so an older leg is best for this.  The response of the leg is greater to currents in one direction than the other and with a suitably desensitised leg it may only respond to currents in one direction.  For a current going into the leg from the nerve, the leg will twitch on making the circuit.  For a current passing out of the leg, it will twitch on breaking the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

The major drawback of the frog galvanoscope is that the frog leg frequently needs replacing.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, citing Matteucci&lt;/ref&gt;  The leg will continue to respond for up to 44 hours, but after that a fresh one must be prepared.&lt;ref name="Picc75"/&gt;

== History ==
According to co-founder ''Yaron Saghiv'', the idea about the online sharing economy came out of several friends’ frustration at being bored by going to the same places every time they wanted to spend quality free time in a social setting.

[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|The [[Airbus A380]] glass cockpit featuring "pull out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots"&lt;ref name="Chui"/&gt;]]

A '''glass cockpit''' is an [[aircraft cockpit]] that features electronic (digital) [[flight instrument]] [[display device|display]]s, typically large [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screens, rather than the traditional style of [[Analog device|analog]] dials and gauges. While a traditional cockpit (nicknamed a "steam cockpit" within aviation circles) relies on numerous mechanical gauges to display information, a glass cockpit uses several displays driven by [[flight management system]]s, that can be adjusted ([[multi-function display]]) to display flight information as needed. This simplifies aircraft operation and navigation and allows [[aviator|pilots]] to focus only on the most pertinent information. They are also popular with airline companies as they usually eliminate the need for a [[flight engineer]], saving costs. In recent years the technology has also become widely available in small aircraft.

As aircraft displays have modernized, the sensors that feed them have modernized as well. Traditional [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[flight instrument]]s have been replaced by electronic [[attitude and heading reference system]]s (AHRS) and [[air data computer]]s (ADCs), improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance. [[GPS]] receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits.

Early glass cockpits, found in the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|90]], [[Boeing 737 Classic]], [[Boeing 757|757]] and [[Boeing 767|767-200/-300]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] and in the Airbus [[Airbus A300|A300-600]] and [[Airbus A310|A310]], used [[Electronic Flight Instrument System]]s (EFIS) to display attitude and navigational information only, with traditional mechanical gauges retained for airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and engine performance. Later glass cockpits, found in the Boeing [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737NG]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]], [[Boeing 767|767-400]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] and later Airbuses, [[Ilyushin Il-96]] and [[Tupolev Tu-204]] have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft. While glass cockpit-equipped aircraft throughout the late 20th century still retained analog [[altimeter]]s, [[Attitude indicator|attitude]], and [[airspeed indicator]]s as standby instruments in case the EFIS displays failed, more modern aircraft have been increasingly been using digital standby instruments as well, such as the [[Integrated standby instrument system]].

== History ==
{{Double image|right|C-5A Cockpit.jpg|220|C-5M Cockpit.jpg|220|Analog instrument panel of a [[C-5 Galaxy|C-5A]]|Upgraded "glass" [[C-5M]] instrument panel}}

Glass cockpits originated in military aircraft in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970–73), which featured a [[multi-function display]].

Prior to the 1970s, air transport operations were not considered sufficiently demanding to require advanced equipment like electronic flight displays. Also, computer technology was not at a level where sufficiently light and powerful [[electrical network|circuits]] were available. The increasing complexity of transport aircraft, the advent of digital systems and the growing air traffic congestion around [[airport]]s began to change that.

The [[Boeing 2707]] was one of the earliest commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit. Most cockpit instruments were still analog, but [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays were to be used for the [[Attitude indicator]] and [[Horizontal situation indicator|HSI]]. However, the 2707 was cancelled in 1971 after insurmountable technical difficulties and ultimately the end of project funding by the US government.

The average transport aircraft in the mid-1970s had more than one hundred cockpit instruments and controls, and the primary flight instruments were already crowded with indicators, crossbars, and symbols, and the growing number of cockpit elements were competing for cockpit space and pilot attention.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; As a result, [[NASA]] conducted research on displays that could process the raw aircraft system and flight data into an integrated, easily understood picture of the flight situation, culminating in a series of flights demonstrating a full glass cockpit system.

The success of the NASA-led glass cockpit work is reflected in the total acceptance of electronic flight displays beginning with the introduction of the [[MD-80]] in [[1979 in aviation|1979]]. Airlines and their passengers alike have benefited. The safety and efficiency of flights have been increased with improved pilot understanding of the aircraft's situation relative to its environment (or "[[situational awareness]]").

By the end of the 1990s, [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) panels were increasingly favored among aircraft manufacturers because of their efficiency, reliability and legibility. Earlier LCD panels suffered from poor legibility at some viewing angles and poor response times, making them unsuitable for aviation. Modern aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Boeing 717|717]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8I|747-8F]] [[Boeing 767|767-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], [[Airbus A320 family]] (later versions), [[Airbus A330|A330]] (later versions), [[Airbus A340|A340-500/600]], [[Airbus A340|A340-300]] (later versions), [[Airbus A380|A380]] and [[Airbus A350|A350]] are fitted with glass cockpits consisting of LCD units.&lt;ref name="A320"/&gt;

The glass cockpit has become standard equipment in [[airliner]]s, [[business jets]], and [[military aircraft]]. It was fitted into NASA's [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']], [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']], [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], and [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], and the current Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] TMA model spacecraft that was launched in 2002. By the end of the century glass cockpits began appearing in [[general aviation]] aircraft as well. In 2003, [[Cirrus Design]]'s [[Cirrus SR20|SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]] became the first [[light aircraft]] equipped with glass cockpits, which they made standard on all Cirrus aircraft. By [[2005 in aviation|2005]], even basic trainers like the [[Piper Cherokee]] and [[Cessna 172]] were shipping with glass cockpits as options (which nearly all customers chose), as well as many modern aircraft such as the [[Diamond DA42]] twin-engine travel and training aircraft. The [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] features a "panoramic cockpit display" touchscreen that replaces most of the switches and toggles found in an aircraft cockpit. The civilian [[Cirrus Vision SF50]] now has the same, which they call a "Perspective Touch" glass cockpit.

=== Commercial aviation ===
[[File:15-07-14-Suchoj-Superjet-100-RalfR-WMA 0547-0550.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Superjet 100]] glass cockpit]]

Unlike the previous era of glass cockpits—where designers merely copied the look and feel of conventional electromechanical instruments onto cathode ray tubes—the new displays represent a true departure. They look and behave very similarly to other computers, with windows and data that can be manipulated with point-and-click devices. They also add terrain, approach charts, weather, vertical displays, and 3D navigation images.

The improved concepts enable aircraft makers to customize cockpits to a greater degree than previously. All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another—such as using a [[trackball]], thumb pad or [[joystick]] as a pilot-input device in a computer-style environment. Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human-machine interface to increase safety.

Modern glass cockpits might include Synthetic Vision (SVS) or Enhanced Vision systems (EVS). Synthetic Vision systems display a realistic 3D depiction of the outside world (similar to a [[flight simulator]]), based on a database of terrain and geophysical features in conjunction with the attitude and position information gathered from the aircraft navigational systems. Enhanced Vision systems add real-time information from external sensors, such as an infrared camera.

All new airliners such as the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]] and private jets such as [[Bombardier Global Express]] and [[Learjet]] use glass cockpits.

=== General aviation ===
[[File:Cessna T182T Cockpit - Garmin G1000.jpg|thumb|[[Garmin G1000]] displays in a [[Cessna 182]]. Note the three analog standby instruments near the bottom of the main instrument panel.]]

Many modern [[general aviation]] aircraft are available with glass cockpits. Systems such as the [[Garmin G1000]] are now available on many new [[general aviation|GA]] aircraft, including the classic [[Cessna 172]]. Many small aircraft can also be modified post-production to replace analogue instruments.

Glass cockpits are also popular as a retrofit for older private jets and turboprops such as [[Dassault Falcon]]s, [[Hawker Beechcraft#Products|Raytheon Hawkers]], [[Bombardier Challenger]]s, [[Cessna Citation family|Cessna Citations]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace#Products|Gulfstreams]], [[Beechcraft King Air|King Airs]], [[Learjet#Aircraft|Learjets]], [[IAI Astra|Astras]], and many others. Aviation service companies work closely with equipment manufacturers to address the needs of the owners of these aircraft.

=== Consumer, research, hobby &amp; recreational aviation ===

Today, smartphones and tablets use mini-applications, or "apps," to remotely control complex devices, by WiFi radio interface. They demonstrate how the "glass cockpit" idea is being applied to consumer devices. Applications include toy-grade [[UAV]]s which use the display and touch screen of a tablet or smartphone to employ every aspect of the "glass cockpit" for instrument display, and [[fly-by-wire]] for aircraft control.

=== NASA Space Shuttle program ===
[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle]] glass cockpit]]

The glass cockpit idea made news in 1980s trade magazines, like [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], when NASA announced that it would be replacing most of the electro-mechanical flight instruments in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components. The articles mentioned how glass cockpit components had the added benefit of being a few hundred pounds lighter than the original flight instruments and support systems used in the space shuttles.

== Safety ==

As aircraft operation depends on glass cockpit systems, flight crews must be trained to deal with possible failures.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The [[Airbus A320 family]] has seen fifty incidents where several flight displays were lost.&lt;ref name="NTSB safety recommendation A08-53"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A08_53_55.pdf |publisher= National Transportation Safety Board |title= Safety Recommendation A08-53 |date= July 22, 2008 |quote= According to Airbus, as of May 2007, 49 events similar to the United Airlines flight 731 and UK events had occurred in which the failure of electrical busses resulted in the loss of flight displays and various aircraft systems. |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2008 [[United Airlines]] Flight 731 experienced a serious glass-cockpit blackout, losing half of the [[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor|ECAM]] displays as well as all radios, transponders, [[Traffic collision avoidance system|TCAS]], and attitude indicators.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions.

Airbus has offered an optional fix, which the US [[NTSB]] has suggested to the US [[FAA]] as mandatory, but the FAA has yet to make it a requirement.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt; A preliminary NTSB factsheet is available.&lt;ref name="DCA08IA033"/&gt; Due to the possibility of a blackout, glass cockpit aircraft also have an [[integrated standby instrument system]] that includes (at a minimum) an [[artificial horizon]], [[altimeter]] and [[airspeed indicator]]. It is [[Electronics|electronically]] separate from the main instruments and can run for several hours on a backup battery.

In 2010, the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] published a study done on 8,000 general aviation light aircraft. The study found that, although aircraft equipped with glass cockpits had a lower overall accident rate, they also had a larger chance of being involved in a fatal accident.&lt;ref name="NTSB Safety"/&gt; The NTSB Chairman said in response to the study:
{{quote|Training is clearly one of the key components to reducing the accident rate of light planes equipped with glass cockpits, and this study clearly demonstrates the life and death importance of appropriate training on these complex systems... While the technological innovations and flight management tools that glass cockpit equipped airplanes bring to the general aviation community should reduce the number of fatal accidents, we have not—unfortunately—seen that happen.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23421">'''Grey literature''' (or '''gray literature''') are materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional [[publishing|commercial]] or [[academic publishing]] and distribution channels. Common grey literature publication types include reports ([[annual report|annual]], research, [[technical report|technical]], project, etc.), [[working paper]]s, government documents, [[white paper]]s and [[evaluation]]s. Organizations that produce grey literature include government departments and agencies, civil society or [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], academic centres and departments, and private companies and consultants.

Grey literature may be made available to the public, or distributed privately within organizations or groups, and may lack a systematic means of distribution and collection. The standard of quality, review and production of grey literature can vary considerably. Grey literature may be difficult to discover, access, and evaluate, but this can be addressed through the formulation of sound search strategies.

==Definitions==
While a hazy definition of "grey literature" had existed previously, the term is generally understood to have been coined by the researcher Charles P. Auger, who wrote ''Use of Reports Literature'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=C.P. |editor-last=Auger |year=1975 |title=Use of Reports Literature |publisher=Butterworth |place=London |isbn=040870666X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature he referred to consisted of intelligence reports and notes on atomic research produced in vast quantities by the [[Allied Forces]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. In a conference held by the British Lending Library Division in 1978, Auger used the term "grey literature" to describe the concept for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rucinski|first1=Taryn|title=The elephant in the room: toward a definition of grey legal literature|journal=Law Library Journal|date=2015|volume=107|issue=4|pages=543-559}}&lt;/ref&gt; His concepts focused upon a "vast body of documents", with "continuing increasing quantity", that were characterized by the "difficulty it presents to the librarian". Auger described the documentation as having great ambiguity between temporary character and durability, and by a growing impact on scientific research. While acknowledging the challenges of reports literature, he recognized that it held a number of advantages "over other means of dissemination, including greater speed, greater flexibility and the opportunity to go into considerable detail if necessary". Auger considered reports a "half-published" communication medium with a "complex interrelationship [to] scientific journals". In 1989 Auger published the second edition of ''The Documentation of the European Communities: A Guide'', which contained the first usage of the term "grey literature" in a published work.&lt;ref name="Augered" /&gt;

The "Luxembourg definition", discussed and approved at the Third International Conference on Grey Literature in 1997, defined grey literature as "that which is produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats, but which is not controlled by commercial publishers". In 2004, at the Sixth Conference in [[New York City]], a postscript was added to the definition for purposes of clarification: grey literature is "...not controlled by commercial publishers, i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. |last1=Schöpfel |first2=D.J. |last2=Farace |year=2010 |chapter=Grey Literature |editor1-first=M.J. |editor1-last=Bates |editor2-first=M.N. |editor2-last=Maack |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=2029–2039 |publisher=CRC Press |place=Boca Raton, Fla. |isbn=9780849397127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition  is now widely accepted by the scholarly community.

The U.S. Interagency Gray Literature Working Group (IGLWG), in its "Gray Information Functional Plan" of 1995, defined grey literature as "foreign or domestic open source material that usually is available through specialized channels and may not enter normal channels or systems of publication, distribution, bibliographic control, or acquisition by booksellers or subscription agents". Thus grey literature is usually inaccessible through relevant reference tools such as databases and indexes, which rely upon the reporting of subscription agents.

Other terms used for this material include: report literature, government publications, policy documents, fugitive literature, nonconventional literature, unpublished literature, non-traditional publications, and ephemeral publications. With the introduction of desktop publishing and the Internet, new terms include: electronic publications, online publications, online resources, open-access research, and digital documents.

Though the concept is difficult to define, the term grey literature is an agreed collective term that researchers and information professionals can use to discuss this distinct but disparate group of resources.

In 2010, D.J. Farace and J. Schöpfel pointed out that existing definitions of grey literature were predominantly economic, and argued that in a changing research environment, with new channels of scientific communication, grey literature needed a new conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=D.J. |editor1-last=Farace |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Schöpfel |year=2010 |title=Grey Literature in Library and Information Studies |publisher=De Gruyter Saur |place=Berlin |isbn=9783598117930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed the "Prague definition" as follows:{{quote|text=Grey literature stands for manifold document types produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats that are protected by intellectual property rights, of sufficient quality to be collected and preserved by library holdings or institutional repositories, but not controlled by commercial publishers i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Towards a Prague Definition of Grey Literature - OpenGrey|url = http://www.opengrey.eu/item/display/10068/700015|website = www.opengrey.eu|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Due to the rapid increase [[web publishing]] and access to documents, the focus of grey literature has shifted to quality, [[intellectual property]], curation, and accessibility.

==Publication types==
The term ''grey literature'' acts as a collective noun to refer to a large number of publications types produced by organizations for various reasons. These include: research and project reports, annual or activity reports, [[theses]], [[conference proceedings]], [[preprints]], [[working paper]]s, [[newsletters]], technical reports, recommendations and [[technical standard]]s, [[patents]], technical notes, data and statistics, presentations, field notes, laboratory research books, academic [[courseware]], lecture notes, evaluations, and many more. The international network [[Grey Literature Network Service|GreyNet]] maintains an online listing of document types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |title=Grey Literature – GreySource, A Selection of Web-based Resources in Grey Literature |publisher=Greynet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations produce grey literature as a means of encapsulating, storing and sharing information for their own use, and for wider distribution. This can take the form of a record of data and information on a site or project (archaeological records, survey data, working papers); sharing information on how and why things occurred (technical reports and specifications, briefings, evaluations, project reports); describing and advocating for changes to public policy, practice or legislation (white papers, discussion papers, submissions); meeting statutory or other requirements for information sharing or management (annual reports, consultation documents); and many other reasons.

Organizations are often looking to create the required output, sharing it with relevant parties quickly and easily, without the delays and restrictions of academic journal and book publishing. Often there is little incentive or justification for organizations or individuals to publish in academic journals and books, and often no need to charge for access to organizational outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Encyclopedia of Information and Library Science|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0vL9QQT0sC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2003-09-02|isbn = 9781134513208|first = John|last = Feather|first2 = Paul|last2 = Sturges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some information organizations may be required to make certain information and documents public. On the other hand, grey literature is not necessarily always free, with some resources, such as market reports, selling for thousands of dollars. However, this is the exception and on the whole grey literature, while costly to produce, is usually made available for free.

While production and research quality may be extremely high (with organizational reputation vested in the end product), the producing body, not being a formal publisher, generally lacks the channels for extensive distribution and bibliographic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Where is the evidence: realising the value of grey literature for public policy and practice|url = http://apo.org.au/node/42299|doi = 10.4225/50/5580B1E02DAF9|last = Lawrence|first = Amanda|last2 = Houghton|first2 = John|date = |year = 2014|last3 = Thomas|first3 = Julian|last4 = Weldon|first4 = Paul|publisher = Swinburne Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information and research professionals generally draw a distinction between [[ephemera]] and grey literature. However, there are certain overlaps between the two media and they undoubtedly share common frustrations such as bibliographic control issues. Unique written documents such as [[manuscript]]s and [[archive]]s, and personal communications, are not usually considered to fall under the heading of grey literature, although they again share some of the same problems of control and access.

==Impact==
The relative importance of grey literature is largely dependent on research disciplines and subjects, on methodological approaches, and on the sources they use. In some fields, especially in the life sciences and medical sciences, there has been a traditional preference for only using peer-reviewed academic journals while in others, such as agriculture, aeronautics and the engineering sciences in general, grey literature resources tend to predominate.

In the last few decades, [[systematic reviews|systematic literature reviews]] in health and medicine have established the importance of discovering and analyzing grey literature as part of the [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-base]] and in order to avoid publication bias.

Grey literature is particularly important as a means of distributing scientific and technical and public policy and practice information.&lt;ref&gt;Sondergaard T. F.; Andersen J.; Hjorland B. Documents and the communication of scientific and scholarly information. Revising and updating the UNISIST model. Journal of Documentation 2003, 59, (3), 278–320.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professionals insist on its importance for two main reasons: research results are often more detailed in reports, doctoral theses and conference proceedings than in journals, and they are distributed in these forms up to 12 or even 18 months before being published elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Abel R. Book and Journal Publishing. In Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science. May 14, 2004, 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Some results simply are not published anywhere else.

In particular, public administrations and public and industrial research laboratories produce a great deal of “grey” material, often for internal and in some cases “restricted” dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Ullah M.F.; Kanwar S.S.; Kumar P. A quantitative analysis of citations of research reports published by National Institute of Hydrology, Rorkee. Annals of Library and Information Studies 2004, 51, (3), 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[evidence-based policy]] has also seen some recognition of the importance of grey literature as part of the evidence-base; however, the term is not yet widely used in public policy and the social sciences more broadly.

==Problems==
For a number of reasons, discovery, access, evaluation and curation of grey literature pose a number of difficulties.

Generally, grey literature lacks any strict or meaningful bibliographic control. Basic information such as authors, publication dates and publishing or corporate bodies may not be easily identified. Similarly, the nonprofessional [[Page layout|layout]]s and formats, low print runs and non-conventional channels of distribution make the organized collection of grey literature a challenge compared to [[academic journal|journal]]s and [[book]]s.&lt;ref name="Augered"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=C.P. |editor-last=Auger |year=1989 |title=Information Sources in Grey Literature |publisher=Bowker-Saur |place=London |edition=2nd |isbn=0862918715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although grey literature is often discussed with reference to scientific research, it is by no means restricted to any one field: outside the [[Hard and soft science|hard sciences]], it presents significant challenges in [[archaeology]] where site surveys and [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] reports, containing unique data, have frequently been produced and circulated in informal "grey" formats.

Some of the problems of accessing grey literature have decreased since the late 1990s as government, professional, business and university bodies have increasingly published their reports and other official or review documents online. The informal nature of grey literature has meant that it has become more numerous as the technology that allows people to create documentation has improved. Less expensive and more sophisticated printers increased the ease of creating grey literature. And the ability to post documents on the internet has resulted in a tremendous boom. The impact of this trend has been greatly boosted since the early 2000s, as the growth of major search engines has made retrieving grey literature simultaneously easier and more cluttered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Amanda|title=Collecting the evidence: improving access to grey literature and data for public policy and practice|journal=Australian Academic and Research Libraries|date=2015|volume=46|issue=4|pages=229-248|doi=10.1080/00048623.2015.1081712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey reports are thus far more easily found online than they were, often at no cost to access. Most users of reports and other grey documents have migrated to using online copies, and efforts by libraries to collect hard-copy versions have generally declined in consequence.

However, many problems remain because originators often fail to produce online reports or publications to an adequate bibliographic standard (often omitting a publication date, for instance). Documents are often not assigned permanent [[Uniform resource locator|URL]]s or [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] numbers, or stored in [[Institutional repository|electronic depositories]], so that [[link rot]] can develop within citations, reference lists, databases and websites. [[Copyright]] law and the copyrighted status of many reports inhibits their downloading and electronic storage and there is a lack of large scale collecting of digital grey literature. Securing long-term access to and management of grey literature in the digital era thus remains a considerable problem.

The amount of digital grey literature now available also poses a problem for finding relevant resources and to be able to assess their credibility and quality given the number of resources now available. At the same time a great deal of grey literature remains hidden, either not made public or not made discoverable via search engines.

== Databases ==
Various databases and libraries collect and make available print and digital grey literature; however, the cost and difficulty of finding and cataloguing grey literature mean that it is still difficult to find large collections. The [[British Library]] began collecting print grey literature in the post WWII period and now has an extensive collection of print resources. Australian and New Zealand [[Policy Online]] has an extensive collection of grey literature on a wide range of public policy issues, [[ArXiv|Arxiv]] is a collection of preprints on physics and other sciences,  [[RePEc]] is a collection of economics working papers.

Many university libraries provide subject guides that give information on grey literature and suggestions for databases. [[Registry of Open Access Repositories|ROAR]] and [[OpenDOAR]] are directories of Open Access (OA) Institutional Repositories (IR) and subject repositories many of which contain some grey literature.

==Resources and advocacy==
The annual International grey literature conference series has been organised since 1993 by the Europe-based organisation [[Grey Literature Network Service|GreyNet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengrey.eu |title=OpenGrey |publisher=Opengrey.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field of information has been systematically documented and archived via the International Conference Series on Grey Literature (1993, Vol.1)...(2014, Vol.16)

[[Grey Literature Network Service|Greynet]] also produces a journal on grey literature and has been a key advocate for the recognition and study of grey literature, particularly in library and information sciences. ''The Grey Journal'' (2005, Vol.1)...(2014, Vol.10). (print: {{ISSN|1574-1796}}, online: {{ISSN|1574-180X}}). The Grey Journal appears three times a year—in spring, summer, and autumn. Each issue in a volume is thematic and deals with one or more related topics in the field of grey literature. ''The Grey Journal'' appears both in print and electronic formats. The electronic version on article level is available via EBSCO's LISTA-FT Database ([[EBSCO Publishing]]). ''The Grey Journal'' is indexed by [[Scopus]] and others.

On 16 May 2014, the Pisa Declaration on Policy Development for Grey Literature Resources was ratified and published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greyguiderep.isti.cnr.it/linkdoc.php?authority=GreySource&amp;collection=GSI&amp;langver=en&amp;idcode=2014-G52-001 Repository ISTNI, retrieved 22 Apr. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanistic Informatics''' (also known as '''Humanities informatics''') is one of several names chosen for the study of the relationship between [[human culture]] and [[technology]]. The term is fairly common in [[Europe]], but is little known in the [[English-speaking world]], though [[Digital Humanities]] (also known as '''Humanities computing''') is in many cases roughly equivalent. 

Humanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the [[University of Bergen]], and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the [[University of Aalborg]].

Digital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative.  Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.

'''husITa''' (Human Services Information Technology Applications) is an international virtual association{{spnd}}and a registered US non-profit organization{{spnd}}established with the mission of promoting the ethical and effective use of [[information technology]] in the [[human services]]. The main focus of husITa, and the claim to expertise of its associates, is situated at the intersection of three core domains: [[information technology]], [[human services]], and [[social development]]. husITa pursues its mission through international conferences, publications and research dissemination directed at technology applications and innovations that promote social well-being.

For much of its early history husITa operated as an informal international network of human service academics and practitioners. One of the outcomes of its first international conference{{spnd}}husITa1 held in 1987 in [[Birmingham]], England{{spnd}}was the establishment of a working group to determine the feasibility of an international body 'to highlight the importance of human service computing, to guide developments, and to foster international co-operation'.

The working group was composed of Hein de Graaf (Netherlands), Walter LaMendola (USA), Dick Schoech (USA), and Stuart Toole (UK). Initial projects identified by the working group included the development of research agendas, position papers, repositories of information, and promoting a second husITa conference in 1989.  Bryan Glastonbury was later added to the group as secretary. The working group met in Colorado, Denver for three days in May 1988 and published a report on the issues that a husITa international organization would need to address.&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the husITa working group, Computer Use in Social Services Network Newsletter, Fall, 1998, Vol 8/3, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1988 Denver meeting agreed its objectives, husITa wasn't formally established as an organization for another twelve years. The structure of the formal organization was later agreed to at Denver in 2000. The founding members at the Denver 2000 meeting were: Hein de Graaf, Walter LaMendola, Rob MacFadden, Jo Ann Regan, Jackie Rafferty, Jan Steyaert, Dick Schoech, Stuart Toole, and Victor Savtschenko.

== Objectives ==
husITa's objectives (agreed by the 1988 Denver working group) are to:
* Facilitate international cooperation in human service technology.
* Collect and disseminate information on human service technology, including tackling the problems of language translation.
* Provide technical assistance in human service technology and encourage the involvement of countries with a less developed human service IT infrastructure.
* Stimulate international discussion on key human service technology issues and encourage position papers in areas such as security/privacy/confidentiality, curriculum content and teaching methods, and ethical issues in systems/software development and use.
* Encourage publications about human service information technology.
* Encourage international research efforts.
* Encourage standards for making human service technology culturally independent.

== Journal of Technology in Human Services ==
The [http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=wths20 ''Journal of Technology in Human Services''] is the official journal of husITa. Formerly known as ''Computers in Human Services'' it was launched in 1985 as a [[Haworth Press]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;The journal [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wzch20/1/1 Computers in Human Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Schoech, a professor of social work at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]], was its founding editor. The ''Journal of Technology in Human Services'' is a peer-reviewed, refereed journal now published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. Its scope includes the potential of information and communication technologies in mental health, developmental disability, welfare, addictions, education, and other human services. The current Editor-in-Chief is [http://www.laurigoldkind.net/ Dr. Lauri Goldkind] (Associate Professor, Fordham University, USA), with [http://apss.polyu.edu.hk/staff/dr-chan-chitat-chen-zhi-da-bo-shi Dr. Chitat Chan] (Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) serves as the Associate Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Journal of Technology in Human Services Turns a New Page|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15228835.2017.1356996|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related human service technology initiatives ==
husITa was built on the activity of an international  network of human service organizations, academics and practitioners in the USA, the UK and the Netherlands. The section below highlights some of the key organizations, people and events.

=== Early developments ===

In 1978, Gunther R. Geiss, aprofessor of social work at [[Adelphi University]], New York, conducted a survey of US schools of [[social work]]. The survey sought to identify faculty members who had used computers in their administrative, teaching or research activities, or who had consulted or participated in the design and development of computer-based information systems. There were over 80 positive responses indicating a wide range of activities and levels of involvement. The survey initiated the development of a system to track and communicate with individuals with expertise in computers and human services.

Walter LaMendola, professor of social work at the [[University of Denver]] in Colorado, described an incident during a social work conference in 1979 suggesting early indications of the resistance of some social work professionals to computer use in the human services.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaMendola discusses '[http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/stories.htm crowd resistance]' to a human services computer presentation in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a theme which has continued throughout the history of technology use in the human services and continues to the present day. Some aspects of this resistance can be considered as a well-founded concern about the ethical issues surrounding human service technology applications. However, other aspects of technology resistance seem to be a less rational form of [[Neo-Luddism]].

=== Computer Use in Social Services Network (CUSSN) ===
Growing interest in the use of technology in the human services led a group of US human service technology specialists, meeting at a [http://www.cswe.org/ Council of Social Work Education] conference in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Kentucky in 1981, to form the Computer Use In Social Services Network ([http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/cussn/index.htm CUSSN]). By the end of 1981 the network had over 350 members. The CUSSN newsletter continued in print until 1992 when it was merged with the first academic journal on human service technology ''Computers in Human Services''.

In 1984 Gunther Geiss was sponsored by the [http://www.socialservicegrants.org/silbermanfund.html Silberman Fund] to organize the Wye Plantation Conference on Human Services Technology. Conference members developed pre-conference position papers via EYES: a centralized email system.&lt;ref&gt;Papers from the Wye Plantation Conference were published in [https://www.amazon.com/Human-Edge-Information-Technology-Helping/dp/0866564047/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350877770&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=0866564047 Geiss &amp; Viswanathan (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, CUSSN developed CUSSNet [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-17472-001 CUSSNet], a PC and [[FidoNet]] based networking system that automatically exchanged emails between members each night during off-peak telephone hours. [[FidoNet]] was a PC distributed email, bulletin board, and file sharing system that preceded the Internet. CUSSNet quickly developed nodes in major cities in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands.

The name husITa (Human Service Information Technology Applications) was coined in 1983 by Walter LaMendola and Brian Klepinger at the [[University of Denver]].

The Human Service [[Microcomputer]] Conference was held in [[Seattle]].

=== Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) ===
In 1984 Stuart Toole formed Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) in the UK to set up and run national conferences and to publish the CASW journal.

Based on the success of the first UK technology conferences, Stuart Toole, Walter LaMendola, and Brian Klepinger agreed to pursue an international conference in 1987: this conference was to become HUSITA's first international conference HUSITA1.

The CASW  journal was later renamed [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/projects/nths_archive/default.htm New Technology in the Human Services] in [when] and continued in publication under this title until it was closed in 2003.

In 1986 the second UK conference held on [[social welfare]] computing was held.

=== The Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) ===
In 1985 Bryan Glastonbury, from the University of Southampton published ''Computers in Social Work'', the first major academic text on technology and human services.&lt;ref&gt;Glastonbury, B. (1985). Computers in Social Work. London, England: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[University of Southampton]] began publishing the journal New Technology in the Human Services under the editorship of Bryan Glastonbury. In the same year the University of Southampton established the Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) with Jackie Rafferty as Director. In 2007, Jan Steyaert joined as adjunct research professor and together they edited a special issue of the British Journal of Social Work on ''social work in the digital age''.
The [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/ Centre for Human Service Technology] is based at the University of Southampton in England. CHST is an international, multi-disciplinary research center focused on influencing the appropriate use of technology in social work practice and education and researching its implementation and impact.

In July 1997 the CTI Centre for Human Services held a conference on ''Social Services and Learning Technology''  hosted by the Institute for Health and Community Services at the University of Bournemouth.

In 2003 the journal New Technology in Human Services ceased publication.

=== The European Network for Information Technology in Human Services (ENITH) ===
In 1986 Hein de Graaf, Director of the CREON foundation in the Netherlands, organised the first of a series of three-day gatherings. The CREON foundation was a Dutch foundation for computer research, expertise and support in field of the human services. The gatherings, called WELCOM, were designed to increase the knowledge and understanding of information technology in the Dutch human services. WELCOM1 was held in 1986 in [[Bussum]] with Walter LaMendola as the main international speaker. WELCOM2, a smaller Dutch-only conference, took place in 1987, again in [[Bussum]]. The next WELCOM event, WELCOM3: a combined conference and fair,  was held jointly with HUSITA3 in [[Maastricht]] in 1993.

Following the success of HUSITA's first international conference held in Birmingham in 1987 the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs organized an informal meeting of European experts in the field of Information Technology and Human Services.  The meeting was one of the outcomes of a feasibility study carried out by the CREON foundation, concerning international cooperation in this field.  A main conclusion of this feasibility study was that an international (European) network should be established for the exchange of products, ideas, expertise, experiences and skills with respect to the introduction and use of IT in the human services.  As a first step in this approach the informal meeting of experts was organized.  The European network of organizations was called ENITH (European Network Information Technology and Human services).&lt;ref&gt;This [http://wweb.uta.edu/projects/sswtech/husita/history/ENITH_experts.htm report of an Expert Meeting] held by the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs details the early work of ENITH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 an ENITH3 Expert Meeting on “IT Applications and the Quality of Life and Services” was held in The Netherlands.

In 1994, from September 21 to September 23 an  ENITH4 conference was held in [[Berlin]], Germany. Bernd kolleck chaired this conference.

In September 1995 a CAUSA5/ENITH5 conference on “The Impact of Information Technology on Social Policy,” was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Jan Steyaert chaired this conference.

'''Instruction creep''' occurs when instructions increase in number and size over time until they are unmanageable. It can be insidious and damaging to the success of large groups such as corporations, originating from ignorance of the [[KISS principle]] and resulting in over-complex (as opposed to "simplified") procedures that are often misunderstood, followed with great irritation, or ignored.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instruction creep is common in complex organizations, where rules and guidelines are created by changing groups of people over extended periods of time.  The constant state of flux in such groups often leads them to add or modify instructions, rather than simplifying or consolidating existing ones.  This can result in considerable overlap in the message of directives, at the expense of clarity, efficiency, and communication, or even of consistency.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The fundamental fallacy of instruction creep is believing that people read instructions with the same level of attention and comprehension, regardless of the volume or complexity of those instructions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A byproduct is the advent of many new rules having the deliberate intent to control others via [[wikt:fiat#Noun|fiat]], without considering consensus or collaboration. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This tends to antagonize others, even when it appears to the instigators that they are acting with proper intent.

==Media coverage==
[[TechCrunch]] identified that, compared to other markets, the fees charged by legal practitioners are traditionally non transparent, and considered Lexoo “a classic example of how markets can be made more efficient and transparent by moving them online”.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/16/lexoo/|title=Lexoo Scores $400K For Its Lawyer-Matching Service For Small Businesses|last1=O’Hear|first1=Steve|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forbes]] described Lexoo as “the democratisation of legal services”, noting that “the participating solicitors know they are quoting in a competitive environment, so they will offer their best price up front, without businesses having to ask for it. All the ingredients of a classic disruptive start-up.”&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">The '''Linear Model of Innovation''' was an early model designed for to understand the relationship of science and technology that begins with basic research that flows into applied research, development and diffusion &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godin|first=Benoît|date=2006|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/29733964|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|volume=31|issue=6|pages=639–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|750px|thumb|right|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]

It prioritizes scientific research as the basis of innovation, and plays down the role of later players in the innovation process.

Current models of [[innovation]] derive from approaches such as [[Actor-Network Theory]], [[Social shaping of technology]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/53871734|title=Networks of innovation : change and meaning in the age of the Internet|last=Ilkka.|first=Tuomi,|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199256985|oclc=53871734}}&lt;/ref&gt;,provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works. Current ideas in [[Open Innovation]] and [[User innovation]] derive from these later ideas. 

In the 'Phase Gate Model' , the product or services concept is frozen at an early stage to minimize risk. Through enterprise, the innovation process involves a series of sequential phases arranged in a manner that the preceding phase muse be cleared before movie to the next phase. Therefore a project must pass through a gate with the permission of the gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase.

Criteria for passing through each gate is defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for the preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place during the preceding phase or not.

Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented:

# "technology push" model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "market pull" model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The stages of the "Technology Push" model are: 

:Basic science→Design and engineering→Manufacturing→Marketing→Sales

From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the "market pull" model of innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the "market pull " model are:

:Market need—Development—Manufacturing—Sales.

The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different "stages" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation. A history of the linear model of innovation may be found in Godin ''The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godin|first1=Benoit|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2006|volume=31|pages=639–667|url=http://www.csiic.ca/PDF/Godin_30.pdf|doi=10.1177/0162243906291865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of knots''' includes many alternate names for common [[knot]]s and lashings. Knot names have evolved over time and there are many conflicting or confusing naming issues. The [[overhand knot]], for example, is also known as the [[thumb knot]].  The [[figure-eight knot]] is also known as the [[savoy knot]] or the Flemish knot.

'''Malaria vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] that is used to prevent [[malaria]]. The only approved vaccine as of 2015 is RTS,S. It requires four injections, and has a relatively low [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]]. Due to this low efficacy, [[WHO]] does not recommend the use of RTS,S vaccine in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper – January 2016|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=Nov 4, 2016|volume=91|issue=4|pages=33–52|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9104.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaccine is going to be studied further in Africa in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to take part in WHO malaria vaccine pilot programme|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/9533-ghana-kenya-and-malawi-to-take-part-in-who-malaria-vaccine-pilot-programme.html|accessdate=27 April 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues into recombinant protein and attenuated whole organism vaccines.

==Approved vaccines==

===RTS,S===
{{Main|RTS,S}}
RTS,S (developed by [[PATH (global health organization)#Malaria|PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI)]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]) is the most recently developed [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vaccine. It consists of the ''P. falciparum'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in trials due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B]], hence creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials an emulsion of oil in water and the added adjuvants of [[monophosphoryl A]] and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with ''P. falciparum.''&lt;ref name="Links to articles about recent RTS changes"&gt;{{cite web|title=RTS,S malaria candidate vaccine reduces malaria by approximately one-third in African infants|url=http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|work=malariavaccine.org|publisher=Malaria Vaccine Initiative Path|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTS,S/AS01 (commercial name Mosquirix),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&amp;ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection Commercial name of RTS,S]&lt;/ref&gt; was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''P. falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus plus a chemical [[adjuvant]] to boost the immune response. Infection is prevented by inducing high antibody titers that block the parasite from infecting the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI70349 |title=Vaccine-induced monoclonal antibodies targeting circumsporozoite protein prevent Plasmodium falciparum infection |year=2014 |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=140–4 |pmid=24292709 |last1=Foquet |first1=Lander |last2=Hermsen |first2=Cornelus |last3=van Gemert |first3=Geert-Jan |last4=Van Braeckel |first4=Eva |last5=Weening |first5=Karin |last6=Sauerwein |first6=Robert |last7=Meuleman |first7=Philip |last8=Leroux-Roels |first8=Geert  |pmc=3871238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers are non-profit In November 2012 a Phase III trial of RTS,S found that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants.&lt;ref name="doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394"/&gt;

{{As of|October 2013}} preliminary results of a phase III clinical trial indicated that RTS,S/AS01 reduced the number of cases among young children by almost 50 percent and among infants by around 25 percent. The study ended in 2014. The effects of a booster dose were positive, even though overall efficacy seem to wane with time. After four years reductions were 36 percent for children who received three shots and a booster dose. Missing the booster dose reduced the efficacy against severe malaria to a negligible effect. The vaccine was shown to be less effective for infants. Three doses of vaccine plus a booster reduced the risk of clinical episodes by 26 percent over three years, but offered no significant protection against severe malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205|title=Malaria vaccine candidate shown to prevent thousands of cases|last=Borghino|first=Dario|date=April 27, 2015|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a bid to accommodate a larger group and guarantee a sustained availability for the general public, GSK applied for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss//|title=GSK announces EU regulatory submission of malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S|author=Press Release|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GSK treated the project as a non-profit initiative, with most funding coming from the Gates Foundation, a major contributor to malaria eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world’s first malaria vaccine|author=Kelland, Kate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
The task of developing a preventive vaccine for malaria is a complex process. There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.

===Parasite diversity===

''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite’s life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===

The parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.

*"Anti-parasitic immunity" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus ‘marking’ it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*"Anti-toxic immunity" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.

Taking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.

By their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and life cycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.

The epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe, and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a ‘travellers’ vaccine’, aiming to prevent all cases of clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travellers’ health. Problems with the current available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated entirely if an effective (greater than 85–90%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available at the current time, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite’s development.  More than 30 of these antigens are currently being researched by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of a carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite]] (CS) protein. This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

*The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short "pre-erythrocytic" or "hepatic" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.
*The second phase of the life cycle is the "erythrocytic" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration. 
*The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the "sexual stage". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.
*Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecyle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC |title=Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target |journal=Curr Top Med Chem  |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=456–72 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22242850 |doi= 10.2174/156802612799362922|url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' is the common malaria species found in India, Southeast Asia and South America.   It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process which involves two copies of the parasite protein act together like a pair of tong and 'clamp'’ two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding, by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=J.|last2=Malpede|first2=B.|last3=Omattage|first3=N.|last4=DeKoster|first4=G.|last5=Henzler-Wildman|first5=K.|last6=Tolia|first6=N.|title=Red Blood Cell Invasion by ''Plasmodium vivax'': Structural Basis for DBP Engagement of DARC|journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]]|volume=10|issue=1|page= e1003869|year=2014|publisher=[[PLOS]]|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869|url= http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs) thus prevent it from continuing with its life cycle.  Researchers from [[Rhode Island Hospital]] identified ''Plasmodium falciparum'' PfSEA-1, a 244 kd malaria antigen expressed in the schizont-infected RBCs.  Mice vaccinated with the recombinant PfSEA-1 produced antibodies which interrupted the schizont rupture from the RBCs and decreased the parasite replication.  The vaccine protected the mice from lethal challenge of the parasite.  Tanzanian and Kenyan children who have antibodies to PfSEA-1 were found to have fewer parasites in their blood stream and milder case of malaria.  By blocking the schizont outlet, the PfSEA-1 vaccine may work synergistically with vaccines targeting the other stages of the malaria life cycle such as [[hepatocyte]] and RBC invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/antigen-discovery-could-advance-malaria-vaccine/2014-05-27|title=Antigen Discovery could advance malaria vaccine|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=2|last1=Raj|first1=D|last2=Kurtis|first2=J|last3=Nixon|first3=C|title=Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection|journal=Science|volume=344|issue=6186|pages=871–877|year=2014|publisher=AAAS|doi= 10.1126/science.1254417|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/871|pmid=24855263|pmc=4184151|bibcode=2014Sci...344..871R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mix of antigenic components===

Increasing the potential immunity generated against ''Plasmodia'' can be achieved by attempting to target multiple phases in the life cycle. This is additionally beneficial in reducing the possibility of resistant parasites developing. The use of multiple-parasite antigens can therefore have a synergistic or additive effect.

One of the most successful vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials{{which|date=April 2017}} consists of recombinant antigenic proteins to the circumsporozoite protein.&lt;ref name="pmid19633296"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Plassmeyer ML, Reiter K, Shimp RL, etal |title=Structure of the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Circumsporozoite Protein, a Leading Malaria Vaccine Candidate |journal=J.

===Delivery system===

The selection of an appropriate system is fundamental in all vaccine development, but especially so in the case of malaria. A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell type—e.g. the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytes—but in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.

To increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulated delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).

Adjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.

There is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.

Studies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.

==Agents under development==
A completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 a synthetic peptide based vaccine developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] team in [[Colombia]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective, 28% efficacy in South America and minimal or no efficacy in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] showing the most promising results so far.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394"&gt;{{cite journal | author1= RTS&amp;#x2c;S Clinical Trials Partnership | last2= Agnandji | first2= S.

* The CSP (Circum-Sporozoite Protein) was a vaccine developed that initially appeared promising enough to undergo trials. It is also based on the circumsporozoite protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg([[R32LR]]) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in [[Kenya]] had an 82% incidence of [[parasitaemia]] whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* The [[NYVAC-Pf7]] multi-stage vaccine attempted to use different technology, incorporating seven ''P.falciparum'' antigenic genes. These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[Rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P.falciparum''. This result has warranted ongoing trials. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* In 1995 a field trial involving [NANP]19-5.1 proved to be very successful. Out of 194 children vaccinated none developed symptomatic malaria in the 12-week follow up period and only 8 failed to have higher levels of antibody present. The vaccine consists of the [[schizont export protein]] (5.1) and 19 repeats of the sporozoite surface protein [NANP]. Limitations of the technology exist as it contains only 20% [[peptide]] and has low levels of immunogenicity. It also does not contain any immunodominant T-cell [[epitopes]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Individuals who are exposed to the parasite in endemic countries develop acquired immunity against disease and death. Such immunity does not however prevent malarial infection; immune individuals often harbour asymptomatic parasites in their blood.  This does, however, imply that it is possible to create an immune response that protects against the harmful effects of the parasite.

Research shows that if [[immunoglobulin]] is taken from immune adults, purified and then given to individuals who have no protective immunity, some protection can be gained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12806">A '''mobile virtual private network''' (mobile VPN or mVPN)  is a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] which is capable of persisting during sessions across changes in physical connectivity, point of network attachment, and IP address.&lt;ref name="Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"&gt;Phifer, Lisa. [http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid40_gci1210989_mem1,00.html "Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"], ''SearchMobileComputing.com'', July 16, 2006. Accessed July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The "mobile" in the name refers to the fact that the VPN can change points of network attachment, not necessarily that the mVPN client is a mobile phone or that it is running on a wireless network.&lt;ref name="media.wiley.com"&gt;http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/10/04712190/0471219010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile VPNs are used in environments where workers need to keep application sessions open at all times, throughout the working day, as they connect via various wireless networks, encounter gaps in coverage, or suspend-and-resume their devices to preserve [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] life. A conventional [[Virtual private network|VPN]] cannot survive such events because the [[network tunnel]] is disrupted, causing applications to disconnect, time out,&lt;ref name="Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"/&gt; fail, or even the computing device itself to [[Crash (computing)|crash]].&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;Cheng, Roger. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119717610996418467 "Lost Connections"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 11, 2007. Accessed July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile VPNs are commonly used in [[public safety]], [[home care]], [[hospital]] settings, [[field service management]], [[Public utility|utilities]] and other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/case-studies/|title=Industry Case Studies of NetMotion Wireless Software|last=|first=|date=|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, they are being adopted by mobile professionals and [[white-collar worker]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheng" /&gt;

==Comparison with other VPN types==
A [[Virtual private network|VPN]] maintains an authenticated, encrypted tunnel for securely passing data traffic over public networks (typically, the [[Internet]].) Other VPN types are [[IPsec]] VPNs, which are useful for [[Point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connections when the network endpoints are known and remain fixed; or [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] VPNs, which provide for access through a [[Web browser]] and are commonly used by remote workers ([[telecommuting]] workers or business travelers).&lt;ref name="netmotionwireless.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/software-defined-mobility/|title=Software Define Mobility|last=|first=|date=2017-06-07|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makers of mobile VPNs draw a distinction between remote access and mobile environments.  A remote-access user typically establishes a connection from a fixed endpoint, launches applications that connect to corporate resources as needed, and then logs off. In a mobile environment, the endpoint changes constantly (for instance, as users roam between different [[cellular network]]s or [[Wi-Fi]] [[Wireless access point|access point]]s). A mobile VPN maintains a virtual connection to the application at all times as the endpoint changes, handling the necessary network logins in a manner transparent to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa Phifer, Contributor |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid40_gci1210989_mem1,00.html |title=Mobile VPN: Closing the gap |publisher=Searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The following are functions common to mobile VPNs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbitech.com, [https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/ http://www.netmotionwireless.com], http://www.radio-ip.com&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Function
! Description
|-
| Persistence
| Open applications remain active, open and available when the wireless connection changes or is interrupted, a [[laptop]] goes into hibernation, or a [[Handheld electronics|handheld]] user suspends and resumes the device
|-
| [[Roaming]]
| Underlying virtual connection remains intact when the device switches to a different network; the mobile VPN handles the logins automatically
|-
| Application compatibility
| [[Software application]]s that run in an "always-connected" wired [[Local area network|LAN]] environment run over the mobile VPN without modification
|-
| Security
| Enforces [[authentication]] of the user, the device, or both; as well as [[encryption]] of the data traffic in compliance with security standards such as [[FIPS 140-2]]
|-
| Acceleration
| Link optimization and [[data compression]] improve performance over wireless networks, especially on cellular networks where bandwidth may be constrained.
|-
| [[Strong authentication]]
| Enforces [[two-factor authentication]] or [[multi-factor authentication]] using some combination of a [[password]], [[smart card]], [[public key certificate]] or [[biometric]] device; required by some regulations, notably for access to [[Criminal Justice Information Services Division|CJIS]] systems in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]]
|}

==Management==
Some mobile VPNs offer additional "mobile-aware" management and security functions, giving [[information technology]] departments visibility and control over devices that may not be on the corporate premises or that connect through networks outside IT's direct control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/solutions/mobile-vpn/|title=NetMotion Software|last=|first=|date=2017-06-07|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Function
! Description
|-
| Management console
| Displays status of devices and users, and offers the ability to quarantine a device if there is possibility that it may have been lost or stolen
|-
| Policy Management
| Enforces access policies based on the network in use, [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the connection, on layer-3 and layer-4 attributes ([[IP address]], [[TCP and UDP port]], etc.), time of day, and in some VPNs, the ability to control access by individual [[application software]]
|-
| [[Quality of service]]
| Specifies the priority that different applications or services should receive when contending for available wireless bandwidth; this is useful for ensuring delivery of the essential "mission-critical" applications (such as [[computer-assisted dispatch]] for [[public safety]]) or giving priority to [[streaming media]] or [[voice-over-IP]]
|-
| [[Network Access Control]] (NAC)
| Evaluates the patch status, [[anti-virus]] and [[anti-spyware]] protection status, and other aspects of the "health" of the device before allowing a connection; and optionally may integrate with policies to remediate the device automatically
|-
| Mobile Analytics
| Gives administrators a view into how wireless networks and devices are used
|-
| Notifications
| Alerts administrators of security concerns or connection problems that impact users, delivered via [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] or [[syslog]]
|}

==Industries and applications==
Mobile VPNs have found uses in a variety of industries, where they give mobile workers access to software applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/case-studies/|title=NetMotion Wireless Customer Case Studies|last=|first=|date=2017-06-07|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In telecommunications==
In [[telecommunication]], a mobile VPN is a solution  that provides data user mobility and ensures secure network access with predictable performance.  Data user mobility is defined as uninterrupted connectivity or the
ability to stay connected and communicate to a possibly remote data network while changing the network access medium or points of attachment.&lt;ref name="media.wiley.com"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Huawei]] launched a product named "MVPN".  In this case "MVPN" had a different meaning from the way that later industry sources would use the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huawei.com/publications/view.do?id=131&amp;cid=79&amp;pid=61 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525044440/http://www.huawei.com/publications/view.do?id=131&amp;cid=79&amp;pid=61 |date=May 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Huawei product was focused on delivering a seamless corporate phone system to users whether they were on desktop phones or mobile devices.  Although the web page is no longer available, the company advertised that their MVPN had the following advantages over a standard phone system:
* Direct connectivity – the corporate network becomes part of [[Mobile phone operator|mobile operator]]'s network through direct connection
* Private numbering plan – the communication is tailored to company organization
* Corporate Business Group – all offices and employees are part of one common group, that includes all mobile and desk phones
* Short dialing – a short [[Telephone numbering plan|number]] to access each employee, no meter on his mobile or desk phone
* Smart Divert – easy divert within company group
* Groups and subgroups – Several sub-groups could be defined within the group with different changing as well as with separate [[Telephone numbering plan|numbering plan]]
* Calls control – certain destinations could be allowed or barred both on mobile and desk phones.

The '''ORCID''' '''iD''' ('''Open Researcher and Contributor ID''') is a nonproprietary [[alphanumeric code]] to uniquely identify [[scientist|scientific]] and other [[Academic authorship|academic authors]] and contributors.&lt;ref name="Nature09"&gt;Editorial (2009).

It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by [[digital object identifier]]s (DOIs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossref.org/01company/orcid.html Crossref &amp; ORCID].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORCID organization, ORCID Inc., offers an open and independent registry intended to be the ''de facto'' standard for contributor identification in research and [[academic publishing]]. On 16 October 2012, ORCID launched its registry services&lt;ref name="launchORCID"&gt;{{cite web |title=ORCID Launches Registry |url=http://about.orcid.org/news/2012/10/16/orcid-launches-registry |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ORCID vs ISNI; ORCID lanceert vandaag hun Author Register - Artikel -  SURFspace |url=https://www.surfspace.nl/artikel/936-orcid-vs-isni-orcid-lanceert-vandaag-hun-author-register/ |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started issuing user identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Register for an ORCID iD |url=http://orcid.org/register |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and launch==
ORCID was first announced in 2009 as a collaborative effort by the research community "to resolve the author name ambiguity problem in scholarly communication".&lt;ref name="ORCID Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |title=RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS ANNOUNCE COLLABORATION AMONG BROAD CROSS-SECTION OF COMMUNITY TO RESOLVE NAME AMBIGUITY IN SCHOLARLY RESEARCH|url=http://orcid.securesites.net:80/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2018 |via=internet archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202055935/http://orcid.securesites.net:80/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative" - hence the name ORCID - was created temporarily prior to incorporation.&lt;ref name="Nature.ORCID_group"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative (or ORCID) group on Nature Network |url=http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6533 |accessdate=1 June 2017 |via=internet archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060218/http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6533 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/115257-what-is-the-relationship-between-the-orcid-initiat|title=What is the relationship between the ORCID Initiative and ORCID, Inc.? – Feedback &amp; support for ORCID|website=support.orcid.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by [[Thomson Reuters]] for its [[ResearcherID]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://about.orcid.org/content/press-release-orcid-funding-and-development-efforts-target |title= Press Release: ORCID funding and development efforts on target| date=15 August 2011 |quote=ORCID also announced today that Thomson Reuters has provided ORCID with a perpetual license and royalty free use of ResearcherID code and intellectual property, giving ORCID the critical technology to create its system.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORCID, Inc., was incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization incorporated in August 2010 in Delaware, United States of America, with an international board of directors.&lt;ref name="Wiley12"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wiley-Blackwell Publishing News: An Update on the Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID) |author=Craig Van Dyck |url=http://blogs.wiley.com/publishingnews/2012/08/28/an-update-on-the-open-researcher-and-contributor-identifier-orcid-2/ |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/orcidincde-certificateofincorporation-121130175812-phpapp01.pdf|title=Certificate of Incorporation of ORCID Inc.|date=5 August 2010|publisher=State of Delaware|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its executive Director, [[Laure Haak]], was appointed in April 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-your-number-is-up-1.10740|title=Scientists: your number is up|last=Butler|first=Declan|date=30 May 2012|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2016, the board is chaired by [[Veronique Kiermer]] of [[PLOS]]&lt;ref name="board"&gt;{{cite web|title=ORCID team|url=https://orcid.org/node/9#board|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the former chair was [[Ed Pentz]] of [[Crossref]]). ORCID is freely usable and [[interoperable]] with other ID systems.&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt; ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 October 2012.&lt;ref name="launchORCID"/&gt; Formally, ORCID iDs are specified as URIs,&lt;ref name="DG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/trademark-and-id-display-guidelines |title=Trademark and iD Display Guidelines |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the ORCID iD for [[John Wilbanks]] is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier |title=Structure of the ORCID Identifier |publisher=ORCID}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both https:// and http:// forms are supported; the former became canonical in November 2017&lt;ref name="API2-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Alice|title=Announcing API 2.1 - ORCID iDs are now HTTPS!|url=https://orcid.org/blog/2017/11/16/announcing-api-21-orcid-ids-are-now-https|publisher=ORCID|accessdate=16 November 2017|language=en|date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, some publishers use the short form, e.g. "ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385"&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ORCID |title=Template ORCID |work=[[Wikipedia]] |accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as a [[URN]]).

ORCID iDs are a subset of the [[International Standard Name Identifier]] (ISNI),&lt;ref name="ISNI-ORCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |title=ISNI and ORCID |publisher=ISNI |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304210352/http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |archivedate=March 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (as ISO 27729), and the two organizations are cooperating. ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to [[book]]s, [[television programme]]s, and [[newspaper]]s, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID,&lt;ref name="ISNI-ORCID" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORCID.ISNI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.orcid.org/content/what-relationship-between-isni-and-orcid |title=What is the relationship between ISNI and ORCID? |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the range 0000-0001-5000-0007 to 0000-0003-5000-0001.&lt;ref name="Structure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780|title=Structure of the ORCID Identifier|publisher=ORCID|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID iD&lt;ref name="ISNI-AM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isni-url.oclc.nl/isni/0000000031979523 |title=ISNI 0000000031979523 |publisher=ISNI |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORCID-AM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5882-6823 |title=ORCID 0000-0001-5882-6823 |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – effectively, two ISNIs.

Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers,&lt;ref name="ORCID.ISNI" /&gt; using the digits 0–9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens.&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt; The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10" (for example, [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Nick Jennings]]' ORCID iD is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X |title=Nick Jennings |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]]'s is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X|title=Stephen Hawking (0000-0002-9079-593X) - ORCID {{!}} Connecting Research and Researchers|last=ORCID|website=orcid.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a MOD 11-2 [[check digit]] conforming to the [[ISO 7064|ISO/IEC 7064:2003]] standard.

An ORCID account for a fictitious person, [[Josiah Carberry]], exists as &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097&lt;/nowiki&gt;, for use in testing and as an example in documentation and training material.&lt;ref name=orcid-carbery&gt;{{cite web |title=Josiah Carberry |url=http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097 |publisher=ORCID, Inc |work=Biography |accessdate=22 December 2014|quote=Josiah Carberry is a fictitious person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The aim of ORCID is to aid "the transition from science to e-Science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-growing volume of scholarly literature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.orcid.org/about ORCID: About us].&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with "a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list".&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt; The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services.

It has been noted in an [[editorial]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, "could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues’ blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides".&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt;

In April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the [[Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information]] to record and acknowledge contributions to [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="KSpeak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgespeak.com/newsArchieveviewdtl.asp?pickUpBatch=2424 |title=Latest news on the stm publishing industry from scope e knowledge center pvt ltd |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter dated 1 January 2016 eight publishers, including the [[Royal Society]], the [[American Geophysical Union]], [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation|Hindawi]], the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[PLOS]], and [[Science (journal)|Science]], committed to requiring all authors in their journals to have an ORCID iD.&lt;ref name="OpenLetter2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter|title=Requiring ORCID in Publication Workflows: Open Letter|last=various|date=1 January 2016|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSK-2016-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/01/07/why-some-publishers-are-requiring-orcid-ids-for-authors-an-interview-with-stuart-taylor-the-royal-society/|title=Why Some Publishers are Requiring ORCID iDs for Authors: An Interview with Stuart Taylor, The Royal Society|date=7 January 2016|work=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]]|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members, sponsors and registrants ==
By the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants.&lt;ref name="orcidEnd2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/blog/2014/01/03/orcid-2013-year-review |title=2013 Year in review |publisher=ORCID, Inc |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orcidmembers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/about/community/members |title=Members |publisher=ORCID, Inc |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Beirne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordjournals.com/for_societies/partner_newsletter_orchid.html |title=OUP and ORCID |last=O'Beirne |first=Richard |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=15 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330144707/http://www.oxfordjournals.com/for_societies/partner_newsletter_orchid.html |archivedate=30 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2014, ORCID announced the one-millionth registration.&lt;ref name="1mTweet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/533587481686704128 |title=Tweet |date=2014-11-15 |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=15 November 2014 |quote=It’s official! 1M of you have an ORCID iD! We thank the community, and look forward to continued collaboration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|11|25}}, the number of registered accounts reported by ORCID was 5,641,303.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orcid.org/statistics|title=ORCID|last=ORCID|website=orcid.org|language=en|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational members include many research institutions such as [[Caltech]] and [[Cornell University]], and publishers such as [[Elsevier]], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] and [[Nature Publishing Group]]. There are also commercial companies including [[Thomson Reuters]], academic societies and funding bodies.&lt;ref name="ORCID.members"&gt;[http://about.orcid.org/about/community/sponsors ORCID Sponsors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant-making bodies such as the Wellcome Trust (a charitable foundation) have also begun to mandate that applicants for funding provide an ORCID identifier.&lt;ref name="Wilsdon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/Pubs/Independentresearch/2015/The,Metric,Tide/2015_metric_tide.pdf|title=The Metric Tide|last=Wilsdon|date=July 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National implementations ===

In several countries, consortia, including government bodies as partners, are operating at a national level to implement ORCID. For example, in Italy, seventy universities and four research centres are collaborating under the auspices of the {{ill|Conference of Italian University Rectors|it|Conferenza dei rettori delle università italiane}} (CRUI) and the [[National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Institutes]] (ANVUR), in a project implemented by Cineca, a not-for-profit consortium representing the universities, research institutions, and the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name="Meadows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orcid.org/blog/2015/06/19/italy-launches-national-orcid-implementation|title=Italy Launches National ORCID Implementation |last=Meadows|first=Alice |publisher=ORCID |date=22 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the government's [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) and [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) "encourage all researchers applying for funding to have an ORCID identifier".&lt;ref name="NHMRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants-funding/policy/nhmrc-and-arc-statement-open-researcher-and-contributor-id-orcid|title=NHMRC and ARC Statement on Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)|date=10 April 2015|publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French scientific article repository [[Hyper_Articles_en_Ligne|HAL]] is also inviting its users to enter their ORCID number.&lt;ref name="HAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doc.archives-ouvertes.fr/identifiant-auteur-idhal-cv/|title=Identifiant auteur IdHAL et CV|date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2014-05-13 Nick Jennings ORCID Wikidata screenshot.png|thumb|Nick Jennings' ORCID in his Wikidata entry]]

In addition to members and sponsors, journals, publishers, and other services have included ORCID in their workflows or databases. For example, the ''[[Journal of Neuroscience]]'',&lt;ref name="JoN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/site/misc/announcementspage.xhtml |title=Announcements |date=April 2014 |publisher=Journal of Neuroscience |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622104524/http://www.jneurosci.org/site/misc/announcementspage.xhtml |archivedate=22 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SfNeuroscience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfn.org/news-and-calendar/news-and-calendar/news/spotlight/2014/the-journal-of-neuroscience-rolls-out-orcid-integration |title=The Journal of Neuroscience Rolls Out ORCID Integration |publisher=Society for Neuroscience |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springer Publishing]],&lt;ref name="SpringerPub"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/authors/author+zone?SGWID=0-168002-12-1028464-0 |title=Author Zone 16 - ORCID |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]],&lt;ref name="Asakura"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindawi.com/80647648/ |title=Hiroshi Asakura |publisher=[[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]] |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europe PubMed Central|Europe PMC]],&lt;ref name="EPMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europepmc.org/orcid/import |title=ORCID Article Claiming |publisher=Europe PubMed Central |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese [[National Institute of Informatics]]'s Researcher Name Resolver,&lt;ref name="Resolver"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rns.nii.ac.jp/html_us/orcid_integration_help_en.html |title=ORCID integration |work=Researcher Name Resolver |publisher=[[National Institute of Informatics]] |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064132/http://rns.nii.ac.jp/html_us/orcid_integration_help_en.html |archivedate=21 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wikipedia]],&lt;ref name="Wikipedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_ORCID_identifiers |title=Category:Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers |last=Wikipedia authors |work=[[Wikipedia]] |publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikidata]].&lt;ref name="Wikidata"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Property:P496 |title=Pages that link to "Property:P496" |last=Wikidata contributors |work=Wikidata |publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some online services have created tools for exporting data to, or importing data from, ORCID. These include [[Scopus]],&lt;ref name="Scopus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.scopusfeedback.com |title=Scopus2Orcid - Use the Scopus to Orcid Author details and documents wizard to collect all your Scopus records in one unique author profile |publisher=[[Scopus]] |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Figshare]],&lt;ref name="Figshare"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://figshare.com/blog/figshare_ORCID_integration/86 |title=figshare ORCID integration |publisher=[[Figshare]] |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson Reuters' [[ResearcherID]] system,&lt;ref name="ResearcherID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wokinfo.com/researcherid/integration/ |title=RID - ORCID Integration - IP &amp; Science |publisher=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Researchfish]],&lt;ref name="Researchfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchfish.com/node/2525|title=Researchfish now integrating with the ORCID registry|date=4 July 2015|publisher=Researchfish|accessdate=14 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715022313/https://www.researchfish.com/node/2525|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Library]] (for their [[EThOS]] thesis catalogue),&lt;ref name="EThOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/About.do|title=British Library EThOS - about searching and ordering theses online|work=[[British Library]]|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ProQuest]] (for their [[ProQuest Dissertations and Theses]] service),&lt;ref name="ProQuest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proquest.com/blog/pqblog/2015/Connected-from-the-Beginning-Adding-ORCID-to-ETDs.html|title=Connected from the Beginning: Adding ORCID to ETDs|date=12 October 2015|publisher=ProQuest|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frontiers Media#Loop|Frontiers Loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ponto|first1=Michelle|title=ORCID and Loop: A New Researcher Profile System Integration|url=https://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/07/orcid-and-loop-new-researcher-profile-system-integration|website=ORCID|accessdate=7 September 2016|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[DataCite]], [[Crossref]] and ORCID announced that the former organisations would update ORCID records, "when an ORCID identifier is found in newly registered DOI names".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.datacite.org/explaining-the-datacite-orcid-auto-update/ |title=Explaining the DataCite/ORCID Auto-update |publisher=[[DataCite]] |date=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crosstech.crossref.org/2015/10/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-to-the-next-level.html |title=Auto-Update Has Arrived! ORCID Records Move to the Next Level |publisher=[[Crossref]] |date=26 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party tools allow the migration of content from other services into ORCID, for example Mendeley2ORCID, for [[Mendeley]].

Some ORCID data may also be retrieved as [[RDF/XML]], [[Turtle (syntax)|RDF Turtle]], [[XML]] or [[JSON]].&lt;ref name="QD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/browser/?uri=http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5882-6823 |title=Q&amp;D RDF Browser |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/2015/03/orcid-semantics |title=Proposal for the Improvement of the Semantics of ORCIDs |first=Phil |last=Archer |publisher=W3C |accessdate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ORCID uses [[GitHub]] as its code repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/ORCID |title=ORCID, Inc |accessdate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">''For the '''Office of Science and Technology''' ('''OST''') that existed in the United States see [[President's Science Advisory Committee]]''

The '''Office of Science and Technology''' ('''OST'''), later (briefly) named the '''Office of Science and Innovation''', was a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government]] between 1992 and 2007.

The office was responsible for co-ordination of the Government's [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] related activities and policies, and the distribution of some £2.4 billion among the seven [[UK Research Councils]]. It was headed by the [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government|Chief Scientific Adviser]]; initially this was [[William Stewart (scientist)|Sir William Stewart]], then [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert (later Lord) May]], and finally [[David King (scientist)|Sir David King]]. 

The OST was originally formed in 1992 as a merger of the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser with the Science Branch of the [[Department of Education and Science]] (as it then was). Although originally run under the [[Cabinet Office]], it was moved between Departments in 1995 to operate under the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. In early 2006, the office was renamed to the "Office of Science and Innovation", and was subsequently absorbed into the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] in the Summer of 2007 when the Department for Education and Skills was split in two.

The Government Chief Scientific Advisor now heads the [[Government Office for Science]].

==History==
Revel Systems was founded in 2010&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/welsh-carson-leads-100-million-investment-in-revel-systems/?_r=0|title=Welsh Carson Leads $100 Million Investment in Revel Systems|first=William|last=Alden|date=|work=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=san&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/career/2015/01/22/revel-systems-opens-skysong/22182841/|title=Revel Systems hiring for new office at SkySong|author=|date=|work=azcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Revel received $3.7 million in funding from DCM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Daily Start-Up: $80M For Daily Deals Down Under|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/05/24/the-daily-start-up-80m-for-daily-deals-down-under/?mod=google_news_blog|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Lizette Chapman|date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the company announced an investment of approximately $13.5 Million from ROTH Capital Partners, bringing Revel's Series C round to approximately $110 Million.

=== Biomedical technologies ===

The strategic goal of this cluster is to create an ecosystem for biomedical innovation. In order to achieve this goal, the best practices of leading biotechnology and biomedical research centers were studied. More than 215 companies have signed on for the Biomedical Technologies cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.sk.ru/foundation/biomed/p/results.aspx|title=Results - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space technologies and telecommunications ===

The Space Technology and Telecommunications cluster is intended to strengthen Russia's position in the respective industries. The scope of activity is wide: from [[space tourism]] to satellite navigation systems. Russian companies aim to increase their market share in this global market, the total volume of which is estimated at $300 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.ru/Model/AboutFund/Clusters/Space.aspx|title=News - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooperation between clusters ===

There are examples of cooperation between the clusters. For example, in 2012 clusters of Information Technologies and Biomedical Technologies organized joint contest on Mobile Diagnostic Device "Skolkovo M.D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.sk.ru/foundation/itc/md/|title=Сколково M.D. - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FRUCT]] was named the contest winner.

== Innovation City ==

The main elements of The City are the University and a Technopark. The City will also feature a Congress Center, office buildings, laboratories, fitness centers and stores. The City will measure roughly 400 hectares and have a permanent population of 21,000. Employees, including commuters from Moscow and surrounding regions, will comprise about 31,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/Gorod.aspx?sc_Lang=en The City]. Sk.ru/Model - a Vault of animated video tours of the city.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable development===
At least 50% of the energy consumed by the city will come from renewable sources. The well-developed water system uses significantly less water by Russian standards without compromising comfort or hygiene. The transport system prioritizes walking and cycling. The use of vehicles with internal combustion engines is prohibited in the city. Energy passive and active buildings that do not require energy from the outside and even produce more energy than they consume will be built at Skolkovo. Household and municipal waste will be disposed of in the most environmentally friendly way possible – leveraging the use of [[plasma gasification|plasma incinerator technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/Gorod.aspx? Sustainable Development] Sk.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics Technology Center (ETC)==

In July 2012, [[IBM]] and five leading Russian innovation companies: the [[Skolkovo Foundation]], [[Rusnano]], [[Rostelecom]], [[Russian Venture Company]] and [[ITFY]], all signed a collaboration agreement to foster a culture of applied research and commercialization and attract key talent and investment from around the world in the area of microelectronics.

The agreement will give the Electronics Technology Center access to IBM’s intellectual property for chip design. IBM will also provide cloud computing technologies to form the basis of a new virtual design environment to be used to develop new microelectronic devices such as sensors to be used in smarter infrastructure projects, industry and consumer electronics.

The cloud will help unite Russia’s dispersed microelectronics development teams and provide access to advanced technologies and best practice and foster global collaboration. Russian chip designers and fabless design houses will be able to access new semiconductor technologies, including automation tools, design kits, libraries and intellectual property. The center will also provide access to a wide variety of semiconductor production processes offered by many different foundries.

The agreement was signed by [[Victor Vekselberg]], President of the Skolkovo Foundation; [[Anatoly Chubais]], CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of Rosnano; [[Alexander Provotorov]], President and Chairman of the Management Board of Rostelecom; [[Igor Agamirzian]], CEO of Russian Venture Company; [[Evgeny Babayan]], Chairman of the Board, ITFY; [[Leonid Svatkov]], CEO ITFY; [[Bruno Di Leo]], Senior Vice President IBM; and Kirill Korniliev, Country General Manager, IBM Russia &amp; CIS.

The ETC will initially focus on [[microelectronics]] design; however in the future it may be extended to other fields where cloud computing can support collaborative development projects.&lt;ref&gt;rushpr [http://rushprnews.com/2012/07/13/cloud-computing-technologies-to-form-basis-of-new-virtual-design-fab Cloud computing technologies to form basis of new virtual design fab]. 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open University Skolkovo (OpUS) ==

Skolkovo's Open University (OpUS) isn't an educational institution in the typical sense of the word, because graduating students don't receive a diploma. Instead, OpUS is a source of prospective Masters and PhD candidates, for the Skolkovo University of Science and Technology ([[SkTech]]), and interns for Skolkovo partner companies. The educational plan of OpUS includes lecture series, master classes and courses by leading scientists, thinkers and practitioners. Students acquire knowledge in the priority research and development areas of Skolkovo ([[information technology]], [[biomedicine]], [[energetics]], [[space]] and [[nuclear technology]]). In addition, they have an opportunity to gain knowledge in academic and innovative competencies (foresight, forecasting, thinking, projecting), entrepreneur competence, experience in teamwork on projecting and solving inter-disciplinary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk.ru/news/|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpUS was opened on 21 April 2011 in Moscow. Selection for Winter 2011-2012 students was carried out in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Tomsk]]. There are currently more than 250 students enrolled in OpUS.

'''[[Social network service|Social networking]]''' is one of the most active [[World Wide Web|web]]-based activities in the '''[[Philippines]]''', with Filipinos being declared as the most active [[User (computing)|users]] on a number of web-based social network sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Snapchat]] and [[Twitter]]. The use of social networking website has become so extensive in the Philippines that the country has been tagged as "The Social Networking Capital of the World," and has also become part of Filipino [[cyberculture]]. Social networking is also used in the Philippines as a form of election campaign material, as well as tools to aid criminal investigation.

==History==
Friendster is one of the first social networking websites in the World Wide Web when it was introduced in 2002. However, its popularity in the [[United States of America|United States]] plummeted quickly in 2004 due to massive technical problems and server delays.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;{{cite news| first=Gary| last=Rivlin| title=Wallflower at the Web Party| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html?ei=5090&amp;en=3e9438ed349f7ce7&amp;ex=1318564800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all| publisher=New York Times| date=October 15, 2006| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as it was losing its American audience, Friendster slowly gained users from [[Southeast Asia]] starting in the Philippines. Friendster director of engineering Chris Lunt wondered why its web traffic was spiking in the middle of the night, and noticed that the traffic was coming from the Philippines. He then traced the trail to a [[Filipino-American]] marketing consultant and hypnotist named Carmen Leilani de Jesus as the first user to have introduced Friendster to the Philippines, where a number of her friends live.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;

==Statistics==
A study released by Universal McCann entitled "Power To The People - Wave3" declared the Philippines as "the social networking capital of the world," with 83 percent of Filipinos surveyed are members of a social network. They are also regarded as the top [[photograph|photo]] [[uploader]]s and [[web video]] viewers, while they are second when it comes to the number of [[blog]] readers and video uploaders.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921002044/http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf| title=Power To The People: Social Media Tracker, Wave3| accessdate=2013-05-11|archivedate=2008-09-21| date=March 2008| publisher=Universal McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capital&gt;{{cite news| first=Jerry| last=Liao| title=The Philippines - Social Networking Capital of the World| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011094639/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html|archivedate=2008-10-11| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=May 20, 2008| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 7.9 million Filipinos using the [[Internet]], 6.9 million of them visit a social networking site at least once a month.&lt;ref name=Higher&gt;{{cite news| first=Giovanni Paolo| last=Yazon | title=Social networking to the higher level| url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife6_mar31_2007| publisher=Manila Standard Today| date=March 31, 2007| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Friendster has been the most visited [[website]] in the Philippines, as well as in [[Indonesia]], according to web tracking site [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite news| first=Woo Liu| last=Ling| title=Friendster Moves to Asia| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1707760,00.html| publisher=Time.com| date=January 29, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jones, vice president for global marketing of Friendster, said that "the biggest percentage of (their site's) users is from the Philippines, clocking in with 39 percent of the site's traffic." He further added that in March 2008 alone, Friendster recorded 39 million unique visitors, with 13.2 million of whom were from the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Prolific&gt;{{cite news| first=Tessa| last=Salazar| title=Filipinos are prolific, go and Multiply| url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&amp;story_id=144061| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| pages=A1, A10| date=June 22, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Multiply president and founder Peter Pezaris said that the Filipino users of their site comprised the largest and most active group in terms of number of subscribers and of photographs being uploaded daily. About 2.2 million out of more than nine million registered users of Multiply are Filipinos, outnumbering even nationalities with a bigger population base like the United States, Indonesia, and [[Brazil]]. Also, one million photographs are uploaded by Filipinos to Multiply every day, which is half of their total number worldwide.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

Sixty percent of Filipino users of Multiply are female, while 70 percent are under the age of 25. In comparison, Filipino Friendster users are between the ages 16 to 30, with 55 percent of them female.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

==Application in Filipino culture and society==
The popularity of social networking in the Philippines can be traced in the Filipinos' culture of "friends helping friends." For Filipinos, their friends and who they know can become more valuable than money, especially when what they need can be achieved through [[nepotism]], favoritism, and friendship among others.&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/06/try_try_againorkut_friendster.html| title=Orkut, Friendster Get Second Chance Overseas| accessdate=2008-06-22| date=June 15, 2007| publisher=PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networking has extensive uses in the Philippines. It was used to promote television programs like [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus]] with its two profiles on Multiply. A [[call center]] company posted job openings on its Multiply community site and was able to attract recruits.&lt;ref name=Top&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Dizon| title=Filipinos are top Multiply users| url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/19/08/filipinos-are-top-multiply-users| publisher=ABS-CBNNews.com| date=June 19, 2005| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of social networking was tested in the country's [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 general elections]] when senatorial candidate [[Francis Escudero]] created his own Friendster profile to bolster support from Filipino users.&lt;ref name=Chiz&gt;{{cite news| title=Chiz Escudero campaigns in cyberspace| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005703/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=February 26, 2007|archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually won a seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Local celebrities and politicians have since created their own profiles on Friendster as their medium to communicate with their fans and constituents.&lt;ref name=Stars&gt;{{cite news| first=Manny B.| last=Marinay| title=Stars use Friendster's Fan Profiles to reach out to fans| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924012738/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 31, 2009 |archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendster was also used as a tool for police investigations. Local police in [[Cebu City]] were able to track down the suspects for the [[robbery]] and [[murder]] of a female [[nursing]] student on March 2008. After receiving information and tips from the public and other police operatives, the local police searched through the suspects' profiles in order to get a closer look at their faces. The police printed the pictures of the suspects and launched a series of police operations, which led to their arrest.&lt;ref name=Arrest&gt;{{cite news| first=Mars Jr. W| last=Mosqueda| title=Internet used to identify killers of nursing student| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212001504/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=March 11, 2008| archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Manila]] Police District arrested a suspect for the murder of two guest relations officers in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] on January 2007 after they were able to find the suspect's whereabouts through his Friendster profile.&lt;ref name=Gro&gt;{{cite news| first=Natalie Jane M| last=Malayo| title=Suspect in killing of two GROs arrested| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929075156/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 16, 2007 |archive-date=2008-09-29| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networks also became a source of high-profile [[cyberwar]]s, notably between actors Ynez Veneracion and Mon Confiado against Juliana Palermo. The two accused Palermo of creating a fake Friendster profile of her ex-boyfriend Confiado, which is uploaded with photos of Confiado and his girlfriend Veneracion but laden with profanities in each caption.&lt;ref name=Hatester&gt;{{cite news| first=Walden| last=Sadiri| title=Ynez-Juliana feud turns Friendster to "Hatester?"| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002039/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=June 3, 2007 |archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his bid for the Philippine Presidency in May 2010, then Secretary of National Defense, [[Gilberto Teodoro]] launched an aggressive campaign via the social media. He capitalized on networks such as [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. He reportedly spent nearly a quarter of his campaign budget on the social media in the Philippines; in comparison to the current president’s [[Benigno Simeon Aquino III]] – 9%.&lt;ref name=Elections&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pulyetos.com/social-media-marketing-and-philippine-politics/ |title = Using Social Media Marketing to Win Elections in the Philippines |last = Manglaus |first = Roni |date = December 10, 2010 |website = Pulyetos |accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Filipino-American Internet personality [[Christine Gambito]], also known as HappySlip, criticized Friendster for displaying what she described as "inappropriate advertisements" that appear on her profile. She posted a message on the site's bulletin board addressing her fans that she contemplated deleting her account. Gambito had earlier deleted her [[MySpace]] account because she objected to the [[Google]]-powered online advertisements that she said "were in direct conflict with the HappySlip brand and especially misrepresentative of Filipino women." She particularly criticized the posting of advertisements of international [[Online dating service|dating websites]] that supposedly target Filipinas.&lt;ref name=Happy&gt;{{cite news| first=Erwin| last=Oliva| title=Happy Slip unhappy with "inappropriate" ads on Friendster| url=http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20080613-142434/Happy-Slip-unhappy-with-inappropriate-ads-on-Friendster| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=June 13, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Philippine National Police]] Director General Avelino Razon ordered the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group to find out who created a fake account on Friendster using his identity. The profile was laden with false information about him, saying that he "wants to meet traitors, corrupts, criminals so he could crush them."&lt;ref name=Razon&gt;{{cite news| first=Thea| last=Alberto| title=Razon not amused by "Friendster account"| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080117-113057/Razon-not-amused-by-Friendster-account| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=January 17, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2008, there have been cases of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] comments in Friendster profiles, most of which are in the form of a [[JPEG]] image masquerading as an embedded [[YouTube]] video, with a thumbnail of a sexually explicit video clip, such as a girl undressing herself or something similar. Clicking on the image usually results in a redirect to a dubious or disreputable website, or worse, a [[drive-by download]] of [[malware]], such as the [[Koobface]] worm. Because some of the users, especially teenagers, who usually log on to the site in an [[Internet cafe]], have only limited knowledge about malware and/or computers in general, such social engineering attacks can be a significant risk. The site had received considerable criticism due to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://friendstertips.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/how-to-stop-friendster-spam/ How to stop Friendster spam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukaspalad.com/board/showthread.php?t=4844 YouTube Virus?

==New Campaign==
On July 2011, [[GMA Network]] creates the new campaign ''Think Before You Click'' - a campaign by GMA News to promote responsible use of social media.
On August 2016, Rappler initiates the campaign "[http://www.rappler.com/views/143975-no-place-for-hate-change-comes-to-rappler-comments-thread #NoPlaceForHate]" - a campaign that encourages civility when engaging online.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IS-11 ('IS' stands for 'Integrated Software') had no [[operating system]], but came with built-in [[word processing]], [[spreadsheet]], file manager and communication software.

The machine was manufactured by [[Sord Computer Corporation]] and released in 1983. It was later followed by the IS-11B and IS-11C.

==Technical description==
The IS-11 had a [[CMOS]] version of the Z80A running at 3.4 [[Hertz|MHz]] with 32-64 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] [[NVRAM]] and 64 KiB [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. The monochrome [[backlight|non-back-lit]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen allowed for 40 [[Character (computing)|characters]] × 8 lines or 256 × 64 [[pixel]]s. Data was stored on built-in [[microcassette]] recorder (128kb, 2000 baud).

The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos&amp;nbsp;— the city itself, (also the seat), [[Eugênio de Melo]] and [[São Francisco Xavier]]. The last one is known for its natural sites and [[ecotourism]].

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
[[Highland (geography)|Highlands]] predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from {{convert|660|to|975|m|abbr=on}}. The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (''Mantiqueira Range''), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500&amp;nbsp;ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the [[urban area]], there are rolling [[plateaus]] and [[hills]].
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the ''Paraíba do Sul'' river, at an elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m.

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the [[Climate of Brazil|country]], the tropical climate of most of the country and the [[subtropical highland]] climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climatic types in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/brag/v66n4/22.pdf |title=Climatic classification in São Paulo State |publisher=Instituto Agronômico de Campinas |accessdate=September 11, 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month of 17&amp;nbsp;°C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hotttest month of 24&amp;nbsp;°C. With [[global warming]] it is very likely that the city's climate will transition to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification) in the near future.

Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. There's no record of snow precipitation in the city.

The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have a colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls (about once per decade).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monteverdemg.com.br/vm-clima.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, ''Aldeia do Rio Comprido''. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the [[Society of Jesus]]. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of [[Jacareí]] today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several [[Jesuit Reductions]] in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the [[Bandeirantes]].

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as [[slaves]]. However, a [[turmeric]] conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest [[Manoel de Leão]], whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as ''Residência do Paraíba do Sul''; in 1696 as ''Residência de São José''.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive [[Suppression of the Jesuits#Portugal|expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire]] in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. [[Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão]], had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the [[Viceroy]] to create [[civil parishes]], known as ''[[freguesias]]'', and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a [[town hall|hall]] and a [[pillory]], passing over the status of civil parish; and the name '''Vila de São José do Paraíba''' was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the ''Estrada Real'' (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of '''São José dos Campos''', followed by the creation of a [[judiciary district]]  in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in [[Vale do Paraiba|Paraíba Valley]], which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil]] railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
[[File:Inauguração_da_Fábrica_da_General_Motors_em_São_José_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inaugura%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_F%C3%A1brica_da_General_Motors_em_S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|thumb|Inauguration of the General Motors Factory in São José dos Campos by President Juscelino Kubitschek, 1959.]]The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by [[sanatorium]]s became noticed at the

beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became to be known as ''the Sanatorium City''. The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of [[antibiotics]] in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the ''[[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Technological Institute of Aeronautics]] '' in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a "strong mayoral" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. The current mayor is [[Felicio Ramuth]], from the political party [[Brazil's Social Democratic Party|PSDB]] and was elected in 2016.

=== The state administrative region of São José dos Campos ===
[[File:sjcvale.gif|right|250px]]
The [[State of São Paulo]] is divided politically and administratively into 15 regions. São José dos Campos is the seat and the name of the 3rd Administrative Region, which includes the North Coast of São Paulo state and the Paraíba Valley.

The region comprises 39 municipalities with sharp contrasts. São José dos Campos is a densely populated city, with approximately 2,100 inhabitants/square kilometers in urban area, whereas the quiet municipality of São José do Barreiro has only seven inhabitants/square kilometer. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} There are both highly industrialized cities and the others in the region are focused on agriculture and tourism. São José dos Campos is well known as the ''Capital do Vale'' which means that São José dos Campos is the most important city of the Paraíba Valley.

It is one of the state's most dynamic areas, the fourth one in terms of population density, and covers 11.3% of the state's territory. The main municipalities are São José dos Campos, [[Taubaté]], [[Jacareí]], [[Guaratingueta]], [[Caraguatatuba]], [[Campos do Jordão]], [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]], [[Lorena, São Paulo|Lorena]], [[Pindamonhangaba]], [[Ubatuba]] and [[Caçapava]].

{{wide image|São josé dos campos.jpg|1000px|São José dos Campos.}}

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]].

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a [[ring road]] system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*[[Brazilian Highway System|BR-116]] (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north-south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil's coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*[[Rodovia Carvalho Pinto|SP-070]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects [[São Paulo]] to [[Taubaté]];
*[[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|SP-065]] Connects São Jose dos Campos to [[Campinas]]
*[[Rodovia dos Tamoios|SP-099]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of [[Caraguatatuba]];
[[File:Tamoios.JPG|thumb|right|[[SP-099|Tamoios Highway]]]]
*[[SP-050]] (state highway) - the old road which connects São José dos Campos to [[Campos do Jordão]] and the southern region of [[Minas Gerais]].

The city is also served by a railway (the former [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Central do Brasil]]), administered by [[MRS Logística]], which today only carries freight.

The ports of [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.
[[File:Aeroporto de são josé dos campos.jpg|thumb|right|[[São José dos Campos Airport]]]]
The [[São José dos Campos Airport]] ([[IATA]]: SJK, [[ICAO]]: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]] and [[TRIP Linhas Aéreas]] fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista ("São Paulo's East Cone"). [[Infraero]] and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives [[natural gas]] from two gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

It has also a large network of [[fiber optics]], with [[broadband]] services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Service industry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary]] sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Yet even though most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) [[business incubators]] have been created within universities or industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage [[Oil refinery|Refinery]] of [[Petrobrás]]. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of [[Chemical substance|materials]], [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[information technology]], [[aerospace]], [[energy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] control, [[biotechnology]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[software]] among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new [[think tanks]]: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several [[logistics]] providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the [[Vale do Paraíba]], the northern coast of São Paulo and southern [[Minas Gerais]].

A '''technological fix''', '''technical fix''', '''technological shortcut''' or '''solutionism''' refers to the attempt of using [[engineering]] or [[technology]] to solve a problem (often created by earlier technological interventions).&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Stephen P. ''The Worldview Literacy Book'' Parthenon Books 2009. Excerpt at http://www.projectworldview.org/wvtheme46.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some references define technological fix as an "attempt to repair the harm of a technology by modification of the system", that might involve modification of the machine and/or modification of the procedures for operating and maintaining it.

Technological fixes are inevitable in modern technology. It has been observed that many technologies, although invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, often [[Law of Unintended Consequences|create other problems in the process]], known as [[externalities]]. In other words, there would be modification of the basic hardware, modification of techniques and procedures, or both.&lt;ref&gt;The sacred and the limits of the technological fix AR Drengson - Zygon®, 1984 - Wiley Online Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies. It now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap, quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies; these fixes often create more problems than they solve, or give people a sense that they have solved the problem.&lt;ref&gt;The Technological Fix Critique of Agricultural Biotechnology, D Scott, http://wiki.umt.edu/odc/images/d/db/TechFixISU6-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary context==
In the contemporary context, technological fix is sometimes used to refer to the idea of using data and intelligent algorithms to supplement and improve human decision making in hope that this would result in ameliorating the bigger problem. One critic, [[Evgeny Morozov]] defines this as "Recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized--if only the right algorithms are in place."&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013), pg 5&lt;/ref&gt; While some criticizes this approach to the issues of today as detrimental to efforts to truly solve these problems, opponents finds merits in such approach to technological improvement of our society as complements to existing activists and policy efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|author=Alexis C. Madrigal|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the criticism is how policy makers may be tempted to think that installing smart energy monitors would help people conserve energy better, thus improving [[global warming]], rather than focusing on the arduous process of passing laws to tax carbon, etc. Another example is thinking of [[obesity]] as a lifestyle choice of eating high caloric foods and not exercising enough, rather than viewing obesity as more of a social and class problem where individuals are predisposed to eat certain kind of foods (due to the lack of affordable health-supporting food in urban [[food deserts]]), to lack optimally evidence-based health behaviors, and lack of proper health care to mitigate behavioral outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman, Lori and Lawrence Wallack (2007) “Moving Nutrition Upstream: The Case for 
Reframing Obesity,” Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, Vol. 39, Issue 2, S45-S50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change ==
The technological fix for [[climate change]] is an example of the use of technology to restore the environment. This can be seen through various different strategies such as: [[Climate engineering|geo-engineering]] and [[renewable energy]].

=== Geo-engineering ===
[[Geo-engineering]] is referred as "the artificial modification of Earth's [[climate]] systems through two primary ideologies, [[Solar radiation management|Solar Radiation Management]] (SRM) and [[Carbon dioxide removal|Carbon Dioxide Removal]] (CDR)".{{source needed|date=August 2018}}  Different schemes, projects and technologies have been designed to tackle the effects of climate change, usually by removing CO2 from the air as seen by [[Klaus Lackner]]'s invention of a Co2 prototype, or by limiting the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, by [[Space mirror (geoengineering)|space mirrors]]. However, "critics by contrast claim that geoengineering isn't realistic – and may be a distraction from reducing emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is geoengineering?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/geo-engineering|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;" It has been argued that geo-engineering is an adaptation to global warming. It allows TNC's, humans and governments to avoid facing the facts that global warming is a crisis that needs to be dealt with head-on by reducing emissions and implementing [[Environmental technology|green technologies]], rather than developing ways to control the environment and ultimately allow [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gases]] to continue to be released into the atmosphere.

=== Renewable energy ===
[[File:Findhorn wind turbines.jpg|thumb|Wind Turbine|189x189px]]
[[Renewable energy|Renewable Energy]] is also another example of a technological fix, as technology is being used in attempts to reduce and mitigate the [[effects of global warming]]. [[Renewable energy|Renewable Energy]] refers to technologies that has been designed to be eco-friendly and efficient for the well-being of the Earth. They are generally regarded as infinite energy sources, which means they will never run out, unlike fossil fuels such as [[Oil shale|oil]] and [[coal]], which are finite sources of energy. They additionally release no [[Greenhouse gas|green house gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]], which is harmful for the planet as it depletes the [[Ozone layer|ozone]] layer. Examples of renewable energy can be seen by [[wind turbine]]s, [[solar energy]] such as solar panels and [[kinetic energy]] from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable energy sources, and thus overcome global warming. It is also known that such technologies will in turn require their own technological fixes. For example, some types of solar energy have local impacts on ambient temperature, which can be a hazard to birdlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-solar-projects-fail-to-deliver-1434138485 |title=High-Tech Solar Projects Fail to Deliver |quote=Once built, U.S. government biologists found the plant’s superheated mirrors were killing birds. In April, biologists working for the state estimated that 3,500 birds died at Ivanpah in the span of a year, many of them burned alive while flying through a part of the solar instalment where air temperatures can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food famine ==
It has been made explicit within society that the world's population is rapidly increasing, with the  "UNICEF estimating that an average of 353,000 babies are born each day around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Many Babies Are Born Each Day?|url = http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day|website = The World Counts|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is expected that the production of food will not be able to progress and develop to keep up with the needs of species. [[Ester Boserup]] highlighted in 1965 that when the human population increases and food production decreases, an innovation will take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Picture|url = http://bigpictureeducation.com/malthus-vs-boserup|website = Big Picture|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be demonstrated in the technological development of [[hydroponics]] and [[genetically modified crops]].
[[File:Bananier-hydrotown.JPG|thumb|hydroponics]]

=== Hydroponics ===
Hydroponics is an example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to recognise a problem within society, such as the lack of food for an increasing population, and therefore attempt to fix this problem with the development of an innovative technology. Hydroponics is a method of food production to increase productivity, in an "artificial environment."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Hydroponics|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_gateway/green_world/farmingrev2.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soil is replaced by a mineral solution that is left around the plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Just 4 Growers: Global Garden Community|url = http://www.just4growers.com/stream/plant-nutrition-and-growth-enhancers/how-to-mix-a-3-part-hydroponics-nutrient-solution.aspx|website = www.just4growers.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the soil allows a greater crop yield, as there is less chance of soil-born diseases, as well as being able to monitor plant growth and mineral concentrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This innovative technology to yield more food reflects the ability for humans to develop their way out of a problem, portraying a technological fix.

=== Genetically modified organism ===
[[Genetically modified organism]] (GMO) reflect the use of technology to innovate our way out of a problem such as the lack of food to cater for the growing population, demonstrating a technological fix. GM crops can create many advantages, such as higher food fields, added vitamins and increased farm profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q and A About Genetically Modified Crops - Pocket K {{!}} ISAAA.org|url = http://isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/1/default.asp|website = isaaa.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the modifications, they may also introduce the problem of increasing resistance to [[Genetically modified food controversies#Chemical use|pesticides and herbicides]], which may inevitably precipitate the need for further fixes in the future.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html |title=U.S. Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds |last1=Neuman |first1=William |first2=Andrew |last2=Pollack |date=4 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |page=B1 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden rice ====
[[Golden rice]] is one example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to develop and innovate themselves out of problems, such as the deficiency of [[vitamin A]] in [[Taiwan]] and [[Philippines]], in which the [[World Health Organization]] reported that about 250 million preschool children are affected by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitamin A Deficiency|url = http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why1_vad.php|website = www.goldenrice.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the technological development of GM Crops, scientists were able to develop golden rice that can be grown in these countries with genetically higher levels of [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor of vitamin A). This enables healthier and fulfilling lifestyles for these individuals and consequently helps to reduce the deaths caused by the deficiency.

== Externalities ==
Externalities refer to the '''unforeseen''' or '''unintended''' consequences of technology. It is evident that everything new and innovative can potentially have negative effects, especially if it is a new area of development. Although technologies are invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, they often create other problems in the process.

=== DDT ===
[[DDT]] was initially use by the Military in [[World War II]] to control a range of different illnesses, varying from [[Malaria]] to the [[bubonic plague]] and [[Body louse|body lice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/ddtgen.pdf|title = NPIC - National Pesticide Information Centre|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the efficiency of DDT, it was soon adopted as a farm pesticide to help maximise crop yields to consequently cope with the rising populations food demands post WWII. This pesticide proved to be extremely effective in killing bugs and animals on crops, and was often referred as the "wonder-chemical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The DDT Story {{!}} Pesticide Action Network|url = http://www.panna.org/resources/ddt-story|website = www.panna.org|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite being banned for over forty years, we are still facing the externalities of this technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was found that DDT had major health impacts on both humans and animals. It was found that DDT accumulated within the fatty cells of both humans and animals and therefore highlights that technological fixes have their negatives as well as positives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
[[File:DDT spray 1958.jpg|thumb|DDT being sprayed]]

==== Humans ====
* Breast &amp; other cancers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Male infertility&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Miscarriages &amp; low birth weight&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Developmental delay&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Nervous system &amp; liver damage&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = World Health Organization. DDT and its derivatives. Environmental aspects. Environmental Health Criteria. Geneva, Switzerland, 1989; Vol. 83.|last = |first = |date = 2015-10-29|journal = DDT|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animals ====
* DDT is toxic to birds when eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toxicology Profile for (Update); U. S. Department of Human Health &amp; Human Services, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1994.|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreases the reproductive rate of birds by causing eggshell thinning and embryo deaths.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Highly toxic to aquatic animals. DDT affects various systems in aquatic animals including the heart and brain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* DDT moderately toxic to amphibians like frogs, toads, and salamanders. Immature amphibians are more sensitive to the effects of DDT than adults.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Global warming ===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}
[[Global warming]] can be a natural phenomenon that occurs in long (geologic) cycles. However, it has been found that man-made [[ozone layer depletion]] and the release of [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gases]] through industry, and traffic, causes the earth to heat up to unnatural temperatures. This is causing externalities on the environment, such as melting icecaps, shifting [[biome]]s and [[extinction]] of many [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] species, through [[ocean acidification]] and changing temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effects of Global Warming|url = http://www.livescience.com/37057-global-warming-effects.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Automobiles ====
[[Automobile]]s with [[internal combustion engine]]s have revolutionised civilisation and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = internal-combustion engine: Introduction|url = http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/internal-combustion-engine.html|website = www.infoplease.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst the technology was new and innovative, helping to connect places through the ability of transport, it was not recognised at the time that burning fossil fuels, such as [[coal]] and [[Oil shale|oil]], inside the engines would release [[pollutant]]s. This is an explicit example of an externality caused by a technological fix, as the problems caused from the development of the technology was not recognised at the time.

== Different types of technological fixes ==

=== High-tech megaprojects ===
High-tech [[megaproject]]s are large scale and require huge sums of investment and revenue to be created. Examples of these high technologies are Dams, [[nuclear power plant]]s, and airports. They usually cause externalities on other factors such as the environment, are highly expensive, and are [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] governmental plans. 
[[File:Three gorges dam locks view from vantage point.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam.|176x176px]]

==== Three Gorges Dam ====
The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is an example of a high-tech technological fix. The creation of the multi-purpose navigation hydropower and flood control scheme was designed to fix the issues with flooding whilst providing efficient, clean renewable [[Hydropower|hydro-electric power]] in [[China]]. The Three Gorges Dam is the [[List of largest power stations in the world|world's largest power station]] in terms of [[installed capacity]] (22,500&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]). The dam is the largest operating hydroelectric facility in terms of annual energy generation, generating 83.7 TWh in 2013 and 98.8 TWh in 2014, while the annual energy generation of the [[Itaipú Dam]]  in [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]] was 98.6 TWh in 2013 and 87.8 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation|url=http://www.itaipu.gov.br/energia/geracao|publisher=Itaipu Binacional|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Gorges breaks world record for hydropower generation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-01/01/c_127352471.htm|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drought curbs Itaipu hydro output|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/electricpower/drought-curbs-itaipu-hydro-output|accessdate=5 January 2015|agency=Business News Americas|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated to have cost over £25 billion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = GoConqr - Types of technological fix|url = https://www.goconqr.com/en/p/324288-types-of-technological-fix-mind_maps|website = GoConqr|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been many externalies from this technology, such as the extinction of the [[Chinese river dolphin|Chinese River Dolphin]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; an increase in pollution, as the river can no longer 'flush' itself, and over 4 million locals being displaced in the area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Intermediate technology ===
[[File:Rooftop rainwater harvesting.jpg|thumb|226x226px|[[Rainwater harvesting]]]]
Is usually small-scale and cheap technologies that are usually seen in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The capital to build and create these technologies are usually low, yet labour is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Financial Market Integration and Growth: Structural Change and Economic Dynamics in the European Union|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v83xyM9VUZgC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2011-02-14|isbn = 9783642162749|first = Paul J. J.|last = Welfens|first2 = Cillian|last2 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local expertise can be used to maintain these technologies making them very quick and effective to build and repair. An example of an intermediate technology can be seen by [[water well]]s, [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and pumpkin tanks.

=== Appropriate technologies ===
{{main article|Appropriate technology}}

Technology that suits the level of income, skills and needs of the people.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Appropriate Technology text|url = http://lsa.colorado.edu/essence/texts/appropriate.htm|website = lsa.colorado.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this factor encompasses both high and low technologies.

An example of this can be seen by [[Developing country|developing countries]] that implement technologies that suit their expertise, such as [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and [[hand pump]]s. These technologies are '''low costing''' and can be maintained by local skills, making them affordable and efficient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to implement rain barrels in a [[developed country]] would not be appropriate, as it would not suit the technological advancement apparent in these countries. Therefore,  appropriate technological fixes take into consideration the level of development within a country before implementing them.

==Concerns==&lt;!--could be renamed; e.g. to "Issues" or "Criticism", "Warnings", "Cautions" etc--&gt;
Michael and Joyce Huesemann caution against the hubris of large-scale techno-fixes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moonshots for the Earth: are there technological fixes for climate change?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2015/11/moonshots-earth-are-there-technological-fixes-climate-change|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=11 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment'' they show why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter-technologies or techno-fixes are no lasting solutions, and why modern technology in current context does not promote [[sustainability]] but instead collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techno-Fix|url=https://www.newsociety.com/Books/T/Techno-Fix|publisher=New Society Publishers|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] is a prominent opponent of the view that simply technological fixes will solve our problems. She explained her concerns in her book ''[[This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate]]''&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=John|title=This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate review – Naomi Klein’s powerful and urgent polemic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/this-changes-everything-review-naomi-klein-john-gray|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scipes|first1=Kim|title=A Review of Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything|url=http://greensocialthought.org/archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gst67-44-45-Kim-Scipes.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that technical fixes for climate change such as geoengineering bring significant risks as "we simply don't know enough about the Earth system to be able to re-engineer it safely". According to her the proposed technique of dimming the rays of the sun with sulphate-spraying helium balloons in order to mimic the cooling effect on the atmosphere of large volcanic eruptions for instance is highly dangerous and such schemes will surely be attempted if abrupt climate change gets seriously under way.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt; Various experts and environmental groups have also come forward with their concerns over views and approaches that look for techno fixes as solutions and warn that those would be "misguided, unjust, profoundly arrogant and endlessly dangerous" approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geoengineering Has No Place Among Serious Climate Solutions, Declare Experts|url=http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/16/geoengineering-place-among-serious-climate-solutions-declare-experts/|website=BillMoyers.com|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as over the prospect of a technological 'fix' for global warming, however impractical, causing lessened political pressure for a real solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists: We Cannot Geoengineer Our Way Out of the Climate Crisis|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/scientists-we-cannot-geoengineer-our-way-out-climate-crisis/|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''telecentre''' is a public place where people can access computers, the Internet, and other digital technologies that enable them to gather information, create, learn, and communicate with others while they develop essential digital skills. Telecentres exist in almost every country, although they sometimes go by a different names including public internet access center (PIAP), village knowledge center, infocenter, '''community technology center''' ('''CTC'''), community multimedia center (CMC), multipurpose community telecentre (MCT), Common/Citizen Service Centre (CSC) and school-based telecentre. While each telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and social development—reducing isolation, bridging the [[digital divide]], promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.&lt;ref name=ENRAP&gt;ENRAP.

==Evolution of the telecentre movement==
[[File:Global Teenager Project Zambia.jpg|thumb|African children in a telecentre in [[Zambia]]]]
The telecentre movement’s origins can be traced to Europe's [[telecottage]] and Electronic Village Halls (originally in Denmark) and [[Community technology center|Community Technology Centers]] (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;UN. (2000, November).

Page 09 item 41&lt;/ref&gt; Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential.

There are also CTCs located in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that provide technology, resources, training and educational programs to communities in regional, rural and remote areas. 

==Types==
Beyond the differences in names, public ICT access centers are diverse, varying in the clientele they serve, the services they provide, as well as their business or organizational model. Around the world, some telecentres include NGO-sponsored, local government, commercial, school-based, and university-related&lt;ref&gt;Proenza, Bastidas-Buch &amp; Mondero,"Telecentres for Socio-Economic and Rural Development in Latin America and the Caribbean," 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and other countries, public access to the Internet in libraries may also be considered within the “telecentre concept”, especially when the range of services offered is not limited to pure access but also includes training end-users. Each type has advantages and disadvantages when considering attempts to link communities with ICTs and to bridge the digital divide. Among the various types: 

* NGO-sponsored telecentres are hosted by an NGO, which manages the center and integrates it, to one degree or another, into the organization's core business
* Local government telecentres seek to further local development; they often aim to disseminate information, decentralize services, and encourage civic participation, in addition to providing public ICT access.
* Commercial telecentres, launched by entrepreneurs for profit, range from the purely commercial [[cybercafé]] to the social enterprise, where profit and social good objectives are combined.
* School-based telecentres can be structured to involve community members during off-school hours, but costs need to be shared by the school system and the community.
* University-related telecentres can offer social outreach to disadvantaged and community groups, provide training, develop locally relevant content, and establish and facilitate virtual networks.
* Internet access in public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Bertot, J. C., McClure, C. R., &amp; Jaeger, P. T. (2008).

==Need for telecentres==
It is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$ 20 per year available to spend on ICT. In Brazil, the poorest 20% of the population counts with merely US$9 per year to spend on ICT (US$ 0.75 per month).&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;Martin Hilbert ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019 "When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America"]''.

For Latin America it is estimated that the borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the "magical number" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt;

==Telecentres and international development institutions==
In the 1990s, international development institutions such as Canada’s International Development Research Centre ([[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]]) and [[UNESCO]], sponsored the deployment of many telecentres in developing countries. Both IDRC and UNESCO are still very involved in the telecentre movement. The former telecentre.org programme at IDRC was transferred to the telecentre.org Foundation in the Philippines in March 2010&lt;ref&gt;Philippines is new home base of telecentre.org http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2010/02/c6161.html&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to support networks of telecentres around the world. UNESCO continues to support the growth of community multimedia centers (CMCs), which, unlike most other telecentres, have a local community radio, television or other media component.

==Sustainability considerations==
In light of the rapidly evolving technologies that support telecentres and in light of the increased penetration of mobile technologies (i.e., cell phones), the telecentre model needs to continuously evolve in order to remain relevant and to continue to address the changing needs of the communities they serve. As mobile communication technologies become more pervasive around the world, including in rural areas, the telecentres may no longer need to provide phone services, yet they may still be very relevant in terms of access to web-enabled e-government services, e-Learning, and basic Internet communication needs (email and web browsing).&lt;ref name="download.microsoft.com"&gt;Fillip, B. and Foote, D. (March, 2007). [http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/f/69f8c76b-198e-4114-9c12-f0b13e4d7e4e/Making_Connection_Covers_Text_Final.pdf Making the Connection: Scaling Telecenters for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614232403/http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/f/69f8c76b-198e-4114-9c12-f0b13e4d7e4e/Making_Connection_Covers_Text_Final.pdf |date=2012-06-14 }} (PDF).

Among the various sustainability considerations:

''Evolving models'' — since the local demand for information and communication services is evolving, the telecentre models need to evolve as well. Franchises and other approaches to linking and networking telecentres are proving to be popular.

''Evolving technologies'' — wireless connectivity technologies, beyond [[VSAT]] (known to be expensive) are being explored in many communities around the world. These technologies provide new opportunities for connecting communities through telecentres and eventually at the individual household level.

''Evolving services'' — the types of services that telecentres can and should provide is also rapidly evolving. As the fields of [[eGovernment]], [[eHealth]], [[e-Learning]], [[eCommerce]] are evolving and maturing in many countries, telecentres need to take advantage of opportunities to extend the benefits to the community at large, through their public access. Some governments are pursuing the deployment of telecentres precisely as a means of ensuring that larger segments of the population are able to access government services and information through electronic channels.&lt;ref name="download.microsoft.com"/&gt;

''Community stakeholders'' - identifying leaders among the community who champion the concept of shared services through telecentre mode, play a crucial role as a bridge between the telecentre operator and hesitant villagers. Indeed, There is a maturing period during which community leaders have to invest constant efforts to drive changes of behaviour in the adoption of innovations.&lt;ref&gt;

''Community involvement'' is required however, at the initial phase of the telecentre set up, starting with the site selection and creating a sort of empathy and feeling of empowerment. Furthermore, the telecentre should be well rooted in the socio-cultural context of the community.

==Networks==
The telecentres of today and of the future are networked telecentres, or telecentres of the 2.0 generation.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, telecentres are not operating as independent, isolated entities but as members of a network. At times, the network takes the form of a franchise. In other circumstances, the network is much more informal.

One such regional network targeted towards [[Asia-Pacific]] is, the [[Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network]].

In the [[United States]], more than 1,000 community technology centers where organized under the leadership of [[CTCnet]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit association]] headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ctcnet.org CTCnet&lt;/ref&gt;  CTCs are also organized under the banner of state organizations, such as the Ohio Community Computing Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohioccn.org Ohio Community Computing Network]&lt;/ref&gt; or city programs such the City of Seattle Community Technology Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/tech City of Seattle Community Technology Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and Austin FreeNet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austinfree.net/ Austin FreeNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13450">"'''The Californian Ideology'''" is a 1995 essay by English media theorists [[Richard Barbrook]] and Andy Cameron of the [[University of Westminster]].  Barbrook describes it as a "critique of dotcom neoliberalism".&lt;ref name="Barbrook 2007"&gt;Barbrook 2007, [http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/other-works Imaginary Futures: Other Works].&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, Barbrook and Cameron argue that the rise of networking technologies in [[Silicon Valley]] in the 1990s was linked to American [[neoliberalism]] and a paradoxical hybridization of beliefs from the political left and right in the form of hopeful [[technological determinism]].

The original essay was published in [[Mute (magazine)|''Mute'']] magazine&lt;ref name="Barbrook, Cameron 1995"&gt;The Californian Ideology, Barbrook, Cameron, 1995-09, Mute Vol 1 #3 CODE, {{ISSN|1356-7748}}, Mute, London, http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/californian-ideology&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 and later appeared on the ''[[nettime]]'' Internet mailing list for debate.  A final version was published in ''Science as Culture'' in 1996.  The critique has since been revised in several different versions and languages.&lt;ref name="Barbrook 2007" /&gt;

[[Andrew Leonard]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' called Barbrook &amp; Cameron's work "one of the most penetrating critiques of neo-conservative digital hypesterism yet published."&lt;ref name="leonard19990910"&gt;{{Citation

==Critique==
{{quote box|width=26%|align=right|quote="This new faith has emerged from a bizarre fusion of the cultural bohemianism of San Francisco with the hi-tech industries of Silicon Valley...the Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies."|source=Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Barbrook &amp; Cameron, [http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/ Revised SaC Version]; Borsook 2000, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1990s, members of the [[digerati|entrepreneurial class]] in the [[information technology]] industry in [[Silicon Valley]] vocally promoted an ideology that combined the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] with elements of radical [[individualism]], [[libertarianism]], and neoliberal economics, using publications like ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine to promulgate their ideas.  This ideology mixed [[New Left]] and [[New Right]] beliefs together based on their shared interest in [[anti-statism]], the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and [[techno-utopianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet 2010; May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents believed that in a [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]], [[post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Knowledge economy|knowledge-based economy]], the exploitation of information and knowledge would drive growth and wealth creation while diminishing the older power structures of the state in favor of connected individuals in [[virtual communities]].&lt;ref&gt;May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics contend that the Californian Ideology has strengthened the power of corporations over the individual and has increased social stratification, and remains distinctly [[Americentric]].  Barbrook argues that members of the [[digerati]] who adhere to the Californian Ideology, embrace a form of [[reactionary modernism]].  According to Barbrook, "American neo-liberalism seems to have successfully achieved the contradictory aims of reactionary modernism: economic progress and social immobility. Because the long-term goal of liberating everyone will never be reached, the short-term rule of the digerati can last forever."&lt;ref name="Barbrook 1999"&gt;Barbrook 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
According to [[Fred Turner (academic)|Fred Turner]], sociologist Thomas Streeter of the University of Vermont notes that the Californian Ideology appeared as part of a pattern of Romantic individualism with [[Stewart Brand]] as a key influence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2006, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adam Curtis]] connects the origins of the Californian Ideology to the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy of [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;Curtis 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While in general agreement with Barbrook &amp; Cameron's central thesis, David Hudson of ''Rewired'' takes issue with their portrayal of ''Wired'' magazine's position as representative of every viewpoint in the industry. "What Barbrook is saying between the lines is that the people with their hands on the reins of power in all of the wired world...are guided by an utterly skewed philosophical construct."  Hudson maintains that there is not one, but a multitude of different ideologies at work.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Leonard of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' calls the essay "a lucid lambasting of right-wing libertarian digerati domination of the Internet" and "one of the most penetrating critiques of neo-conservative digital hypesterism yet published."  Leonard also notes the "vitriolic" response from [[Louis Rossetto]], former editor and publisher of ''Wired'' magazine.&lt;ref name="leonard19990910" /&gt;

Rossetto issued a rebuttal to the original version published in ''[[Mute (magazine)|Mute]]'' magazine, calling it "a totally out-to-lunch excursion", "a descent into the kind of completely stupid comments on race in America that only smug Europeans can even attempt", an "utterly laughable Marxist/Fabian kneejerk that there is such a thing as the info-haves and have-nots – this is equivalent to a 1948 Mute whining that there were TV-haves and have-nots because television penetration had yet to become universal", an "anal retentive attachment to failed 19th century social and economic analysis and bromides is what allows you to claim that the laughable French [[Minitel]] system is a success" and finally, "a profound ignorance of economics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Gary Kamiya, also of ''Salon'', recognized the validity of the main points in the essay, but like Rossetto, Kamiya attacked Barbrook &amp; Cameron's "ludicrous academic-Marxist claim that high-tech libertarianism somehow represents a [[recrudescence]] of racism."&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture historian [[Kazys Varnelis (historian)|Kazys Varnelis]] of Columbia University found that in spite of the privatization advocated by the Californian Ideology, the [[economic growth]] of Silicon Valley and California were "made possible only due to exploitation of the immigrant poor and defense funding...government subsidies for corporations and exploitation of non-citizen poor: a model for future administrations."&lt;ref&gt;Varnelis 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 documentary, ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', Curtis concludes that the Californian Ideology failed to live up to its claims:

{{quote|The original promise of the Californian Ideology, was that the computers would liberate us from all the old forms of political control, and we would become [[Randian hero]]es, in control of our own destiny.  Instead, today, we feel the opposite—that we are helpless components in a global system—a system that is controlled by a rigid logic that we are powerless to challenge or to change.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;}}

'''United Media''' was a large [[Column (periodical)|editorial column]] and [[comic strip]] newspaper [[print syndication|syndication]] service based in the United States, owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]], that operated from 1978 to 2011. It syndicated 150 comics and editorial columns worldwide. Its core businesses were the [[United Feature Syndicate]] and the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]].

==History==
[[E. W. Scripps]] started his newspaper career in the 1885, and owned 22 newspapers by 1910. In 1897, he created two companies, the '''Scripps-McRae Press Association''' and the '''Scripps News Association'''. In 1907, he combined a number of news providers into [[United Press Associations]] as a rival to [[Associated Press]].

On June 2, 1902, the new '''Newspaper Enterprise Association''' (NEA), based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], started as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general syndicate, offering comics, pictures and features as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monmonier |first1=Mark S. |title=Maps with the news: the development of American journalistic cartography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx8XR_6IMeAC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22Newspaper+Enterprise+Association%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=e5KXSq2LHo_-ywTEz5XnDg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Newspaper%20Enterprise%20Association%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-53411-4 |pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it had some 100 features available.&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hudson |first1=Frederick |last2=McClung Lee |first2=Alfred |others=Luther Mott, Frank |title=American journalism, 1690–1940, Volume 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFtfsd3wZeUC&amp;pg=PA589&amp;dq=%22Newspaper+Enterprise+Association%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=oaGXSr6wNZW-zATLiJjlDg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Newspaper%20Enterprise%20Association%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-22892-3 |pages=589–590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Feature Syndicate''' was formed in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Booker, M. Keith. "United Feature Syndicate," in ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 2014), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; It became a dominant player in the syndication market in the early 1930s. In March 1930, United Features acquired the [[Metropolitan Newspaper Service]] (ostensibly from the [[Bell Syndicate]]).&lt;ref name=EP30&gt;"United Feature Syndicate Buys Metropolitan Service From Elser: Both Firms Will Retain Separate Identities, With Elser Remaining as Vice-President — Monte Bourjaily to Direct Both Organizations," ''Editor &amp; Publisher'' (March 15, 1930). Archived at [http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/05/news-of-yore-1930-another-syndicate.html?m=1 "News of Yore 1930: Another Syndicate Gobbled,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (May 4, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt; And in late February 1931, Scripps acquired the ''[[New York World]]'', which controlled the syndication arms of the Pulitzer company: [[World Feature Service]]&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt; and [[Press Publishing Co.]]&lt;ref name=EP30 /&gt; (which unlike other syndicates were owned by the paper rather than being separate entities). An April 1933 article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' described United Feature as one of the "Big Four" American syndicates (along with [[King Features Syndicate]], [[Tribune Media Services|Chicago Tribune Syndicate]], and the [[Bell Syndicate]]).&lt;ref name="jh"&gt;[[Jeet Heer]], "Crane's Great Gamble", in Roy Crane, ''Buz Sawyer: 1, The War in the Pacific''. Seattle, Wash. : Fantagraphics Books, 2011. {{ISBN|9781606993620}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Features and NEA both became successful distributors of newspaper comics in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Goulart, ''The Adventurous Decade''. Arlington House, New Rochelle, N.Y. 1975. {{ISBN|9780870002526}} (p. 26-7,93-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, United Features Syndicate acquired and absorbed the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] and the [[Bell Syndicate|Bell-McClure Syndicate]] into its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, Dave. [https://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/goldberg-to-retire-from-united-media/ "Goldberg To Retire From United Media,"] ''Editor &amp; Publisher'' (December 17, 2001): "The executive joined United in 1972 when it bought Bell McClure Syndicate and North American Newspaper Alliance, where Goldberg was president."&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1978 Scripps merged United Features and NEA to form '''United Media Enterprises'''.&lt;ref name=UPIMay1978&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date= May 19, 1978 |title= News Features Services Merge As United Media |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19780519&amp;id=XV1YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-jQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5442,4579037 |newspaper=[[United Press International]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=2015-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United Features consolidates," ''The Comics Journal'' #44 (Jan. 1979), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Jim Davis's company, [[Paws, Inc.]], purchased the rights to ''[[Garfield]]'' (including the strips from 1978 to 1993) from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], while rights for the strip remain with Paws.

On June 3, 2010, United Media sold their licensing arm, along with the rights to ''[[Peanuts]]'', to [[Iconix Brand Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iconix-brand-group-closes-acquisition-of-peanuts-95534994.html|title=Iconix Brand Group Closes Acquisition of Peanuts|first=Iconix Brand Group,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licensemag.com/licensemag/Entertainment/Iconix-Forms-Peanuts-Worldwide/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/672956|title=Iconix Forms Peanuts Worldwide - License!

On February 24, 2011, United Media struck a distribution deal with Universal Uclick (now known as [[Andrews McMeel Syndication]]) for syndication of the company's 150 comic strip and news features, which became effective on June 1 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-uclick-to-provide-syndicate-services-for-united-media-116811443.html Universal Uclick to Provide Syndicate Services for United Media], PR Newswire, February 24, 2011. &lt;!--accessed February 24, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Magazine/united-media-outsources-content-to-universal-uclick-64912-.aspx United Media Outsources Content to Universal Uclick]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Editor &amp; Publisher, April 29, 2011. &lt;!--accessed April 29, 2011--&gt; {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the more than 40 comic strips United Media transferred to Universal Uclick, about 75% of them were United Features strips (as opposed to Newspaper Enterprise Association strips).
