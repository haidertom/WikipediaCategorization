'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeo-optics''', or '''archaeological optics''', is the study of the experience and ritual use of light by ancient peoples. Archaeological [[optics]] is a branch of sensory archaeology, which explores human perceptions of the physical environment in the remote past, and is a sibling of [[archaeoastronomy]], which deals with ancient observations of celestial bodies, and archaeological acoustics, which deals with applications of sound.

Research by several investigators around the world has uncovered how ancient peoples encountered and used the [[camera obscura]] principle for a variety of purposes. In a darkened chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Assimina Kaniari and Marina Wallace, eds.) London: Zidane. 153.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical basis==

=== Light ===
Visible [[light]], a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, encompasses wavelengths between 380-750 nanometers, which humans perceive as the colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Light behaves according to a well-defined set of rules: it travels in straight lines, unless otherwise refracted or reflected by another object, or curved by gravity.

=== Vision ===
An [[eye]] is essentially a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Explanation of camera obscura operations derived from Pollack, P. (1969). The Picture History of Photography: From the Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day. New York: Harry N. Abrams. 18.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image is known as a [[camera obscura]] (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a [[Nautilus#Senses|nautilus]], during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.

=== Camera obscura ===
The camera obscura principle is not limited to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, H. and Gernsheim, A. (1969). The History of Photography: From the Camera Obscura to the Beginning of the Modern Era. New York: McGraw-Hill. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, D. (1988). Life above the Jungle Floor. New York: Simon and Schuster. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of experience is available across time.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, E. (2004). Pinhole Photography: Rediscovering a Historic Technique (3rd ed). Oxford: Focal Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image created appears like an upside-down movie. A camera obscura relies on the contrast between the bright exterior world and a dim interior space, so that a greater contrast produces a more obvious projected image. Absolute darkness in the interior is not necessary, but there must be a significant difference between the two illumination levels.

==Archaeological basis==

=== Architecture ===
The archaeological record is replete with excavations of built structures across time, but due to the natural decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less likely it is for artifacts to have survived. For example, [[Paleolithic]] shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;For a good overview of Palaeolithic dwellings structures and strategies see Cattelain, P. and Hauzeur, A. (1998). “Des premiers abris aux premières maisons.” In Les grandes inventions de la Préhistoire (Bellier C. and Cattelain, P. eds.) (Guides archéologiques du Malgré-Tout) Treignes: CEDARC. 37-46; and De Beaune, S. (2012). “Aux origins de la construction.” In Édifice et Artifice (R. Carvais, A. Guillerme, V. Nègre, J. Sakarovitch, eds.) Premier Congrès francophone d’histoire de la construction Paris, 2008  Paris: Piccard. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, some [[Neolithic]] structures retain above ground elements. The Neolithic saw the rise of agriculture and the establishment of settlements, which produced a surplus of foodstuffs and an increase in population density. A large, coordinated labor force enabled the process of hauling enormous stones to build large, permanent structures. By about 5000 BP, many groups of people over a widespread area were erecting large timbers and stones, or megaliths, to enclose communal spaces. Into historical times, the development of writing offered another layer of information, with descriptions of the physical appearance, materials, design, use, and events related to structures. This combination of remnants and records enhances the accuracy of archaeo-optical analysis.

=== Archaeological optics and archaeoastronomy ===
There is some evidence that prehistorical structures oriented upon the sun's position on the horizon also created camera obscura situations. Examples in Western Europe include midwinter sunrise at [[Newgrange]],&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson. 117, 123-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  midwinter sunset at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E.W. (1997). “Maeshowe and the Winter Solstice: ceremonial aspects of the Orkney Grooved Ware culture.” Antiquity 71. 338-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and midsummer sunrise at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, S. (2010). “Bryn Celli Ddu Passage Tomb, Anglesey: Alignment, Construction, Date and Ritual.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 76. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

While archaeoastronomical studies have traditionally discussed these kinds of monument as observatories, fieldwork conducted in the 1990s at [[Clava cairn|Balnuaran]] of Clava by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips suggests the midwinter sunset would have cast images inside two [[Passage Tombs|passage tombs]]. By temporarily reconstructing the collapsed roofs of these monuments, they noted that the act of viewing the sun along their passageways was not only potentially blinding but could only be clearly viewed by one person at a time. In contrast, an audience of over twenty people could stand with their backs to the opening to observe the effects of sunlight falling upon deliberately patterned stonework built into walls of both chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” Current Archaeology 165. 332-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations inspired Scott to speculate that these structures were camera obscuras, and that an optical projection of the sun’s disc would reproduce the movements of the sun through the sky for many people to see at once.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological optics and the archaeology of the senses ===
Archaeological optics contributes to a wider discipline, the archaeology of the senses. Rather than just recording the remains of the past such as standing stones or built walls, this wider discipline emphasizes how the spaces in-between these features could have been arenas for sensory experiences, even if parts of the original structures have disappeared. Among the senses, vision has been a major consideration, including studies of visibility between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, A.B.  and Woodwood, P.J. (1996). “The topography of some barrow cemeteries in Bronze Age Wessex.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 62. 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  interactions with geology and topography,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (1998). Ruined buildings, ruined stones: enclosures, tombs and natural places in the Neolithic of south-west England. World Archaeology 30. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeoastronomical alignment,&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  or color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. and MacGregor, G., eds. (2002). Colouring the past: the significance of colour in archaeological research. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, anthropology has revealed societies that emphasize the other senses&lt;ref&gt;Howes, D. and Classen, C., eds. (1991). The varieties of sensory experience. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  including qualities such as scent and smell.&lt;ref&gt;Classen, C., Howes, D., and Synnott, A. (1994). Aroma: the cultural history of smell. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  The social significance of the sensory of food and drink,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilakis, Y. (1999). “Food technologies/technologies of the body: the social context of wine and oil production and consumption in Bronze Age Crete.” In World Archaeology 31(1). 38-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  and touch and texture&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, V. (2002). “Experiencing texture and transformation in the British Neolithic.”In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 21(3). 249-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  can also be considered.

Other studies have examined archaeomusicology and archaeoacoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C and Lawson, G., eds. (2006). Archaeoacoustics. Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palaeolithic bone artifacts have been interpreted as musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, J.V.S. (1960). “Penny whistles and prehistory.” Antiquity 34, 6-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  or ‘sound producing devices’,&lt;ref&gt;Lund. C. (1981). “The archaeomusicology of Scandinavia.” In World Archaeology 12. 246-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  while some natural features within caves have been found to emit unusual sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dams, L. (1984). “Preliminary findings at the ‘Organ’ Sanctuary in the cave of Nerja, Malaga, Spain.” In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 3. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been suggestions that Paleolithic cave art clusters in locations where caverns have especially resonant properties.&lt;ref&gt;Reznikoff, I. and Dauvois, M. (1988). “La dimension sonore des grottes ornées.” In Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française 85. 238-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s the sonic properties of built architecture came under increasing scrutiny with investigations into vocally induced resonances inside chambered Neolithic sites,&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, P. and Jahn, R (1996). “Preliminary investigations and cognitive considerations of the acoustical resonances of selected archaeological sites.” In Antiquity 70. 665-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the wider acoustic phenomenon within a variety of megalithic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Keating. D. (1999). “Architecture and sound: an acoustic analysis of megalithic monuments in prehistoric Britain.” In Antiquity 73. 325-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaeology of the senses, including archaeological optics, emphasizes that the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were likely to have been used and understood in very different ways by people through time.

==Development of the field of archaeological optics==

The study of ancient perceptions of light developed from many disparate sources — archaeologists, artists, antiquarians, and astronomers  — with precursors reaching back at least a millennium. In 1998, archaeologist Ronnie Scott speculated that Neolithic [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Scotland might have been used as camera obscuras.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Robert Temple published an investigation into [[Nimrud lens|crystal lenses]] that date to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, R. (2000). The Crystal Sun: The Most Secret Science of the Ancient World. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeo-optics, as yet unnamed, arose as a formal line of inquiry beginning in 2005, with a presentation by Matt Gatton and his colleagues of “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art” at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. They made subsequent presentations at the University of Lisbon in 2006, and Archaeology Institute at Oxford University in 2007. A small number of researchers independently began to undertake archaeological optics fieldwork at Neolithic passage tombs. In 2011, Morgan Saletta published a paper noting camera obscura projections at two sites in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 364-73.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2011, Gatton began documenting optical projections at sites in Denmark. Aaron Watson, in collaboration with Ronnie Scott, began to record the archaeo-optic properties of monuments in Scotland in 2012, and Wales in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the concept of archaeological optics as a broader academic field has coalesced with Constantinos Papadopoulos and Holley Moyes’s planning of the Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology, which brought researchers working along similar lines into contact.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palaeolithic archaeological optics==

=== Paleolithic structures ===
The Lower Paleolithic was a time of early humans such as [[Homo habilis]] and [[Homo erectus]].

====Taphonomy====

The actual physical evidence of Paleolithic shelters is limited to permanent materials like stone and bone. No wooden post or animal hide has been found, because these materials disintegrate over the course of time. But the existence of the perishable elements can be established. Postholes prove the existence of the wooden supports. The alignment of the holes or a circle of support stones describes a footprint of a framework. The area covered by flint scattered from blade work, and other household activities, further demarcates the interior shape of the structure.

The types of stones, bones, and minerals found at the campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there are a host of ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until the onset of the modern era.

====Lifeways====
The people of the Paleolithic existed prior to agriculture and the domestication of animals, and they would have lived as small bands of [[hunter-gatherers]], moving from place to place, exploiting plant, animal, and mineral resources. Two of the factors that influenced choice of location were proximity to fresh water and animal migration routes.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P.G. (1985). Pyrenean Prehistory: A Palaeoeconomic Survey of the French Sites. Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paleolithic foragers would also set up camp overlooking fields inhabited by herds of hoofed herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D. (1987). The Field Guide to Early Man. New York: Diagram Group. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleolithic campsites were characterized by repeated, seasonal, short-term occupation. While the inhabitants were quite mobile, without beasts of burden, shelters were not transported. A tent might stand at its location for a few years before it deteriorated and had to be rebuilt. The archaeological record describes shelters rebuilt over-and-over on roughly the same spot. Bands of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers followed an annual circuit with shelters built at strategic points along the way.

====Hearths====
Paleolithic campsites were dotted with external fire pits and internal hearths. The internal hearths were not open-burning fires, but were hollow areas that held heated stones and charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D. and Bullinger, J. (2012). “Identifying dwellings in Upper Palaeolithic open-air sites: The Magdalenian site at Monruz (Switzerland) and its contribution to analysing palimpsest.” In A Mind Set on Flint: Studies in Honour of Dick Stapert (Niekus, M., Barton, N., Street, M., Terberger, T., eds.)

Hot stones and charcoals would be rolled, with sticks or bones, onto a thick animal hide and conveyed a couple of meters from the fire pit to the hearth. The next day the task would be repeated: hearths were taken apart and reassembled routinely. Frequent heating caused the rocks to discolor and crumble. Once a rock was no longer effective at holding heat, it was thrown in a nearby refuse pit along with animal bones and other household waste. An internal stone hearth is an effective strategy for staying warm, but it did not provide any light.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D., and Bullinger, J.

Groningen Archaeological Studies, Vol. 16. Groningen: Barkhuis. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interiors of the tents were then dim places, where ancient people would have witnessed the camera obscura effect.

=== Paleolithic archaeological optics ===
Paleolithic archaeological optics involves investigations into the image projection capacities of Paleolithic tent reconstructions.

====Reconstructions====
The suitability of Paleolithic tents/shelters for coincidental camera obscura formation was explored during a set of experiments under the direction of Matt Gatton in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set of experiments took place on a bison ranch in Oldham County, Kentucky, where a small, rudimentary bison hide [[teepee]] was erected next to a pasture, and images of the bison were cast through a hole in the hides and projected into the tent. The second set of experiments occurred at a rock shelter outside of Irvine, Estill County, Kentucky, where the investigators leaned a framework of tree branches against a rock wall and covered it with bison hides. The image of a horse outside was projected through a rough hole in the hides and into the interior space. The third set of experiments took place at the Musée du Malgré-Tout in Belgium, where archaeologists Pierre Cattelain and Claire Bellier reconstructed a variety of Paleolithic structures in several places in France, Germany and Ukraine. A smattering of holes was present in the hide coverings of each tent. At the German site, images were projected inside the reconstruction onto a rabbit hide.

====Statistical analysis====
The tent reconstructions established some plausibility of accidental camera obscura formation during the Paleolithic, but plausibility is not probability, so the question of the probable frequency of projected images was explored by [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] statistical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 181-190 Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2012). “Projecting Projection: A statistical analysis of cast-light images.” In Pleistocene Coalition Newsletter #18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To evaluate the probability of an unknown event a series of conditional probabilities were used to create a chance tree using [https://www.treeage.com/products/ TreeAge Pro 2011] (Williamstown, MA). The conditions affecting the appearance of projected images are the general context of the shelter, aperture existence, aperture size, sunlight exposure, weather, occupancy, and the specific context of the dwelling. Given the different situations regarding variables; the probability of a person observing a projected image inside a Palaeolithic dwelling ranged from 1% to 8% per day, or 4 to 29 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiplying the yearly occurrences by the range of years and the estimated human population; camera obscura images could have been observed anywhere from 54.8 billion to 4.38 trillion times (5.48x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 4.38x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) over the course of prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications ===
The likely prevalence of prehistoric camera obscuras throughout the human experience suggests several important implications for the development of art, religious beliefs, philosophy and existing cave art.

====Art====
The origins of art have been a significant mystery, because art, as a form of communication, is largely a social construct. The core issue is that there can be no intention to represent an object or scene without first knowing that such a depiction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, I. and Noble, W. (1989). “The Archaeology of Perception: Traces of Depiction and Language.” In Current Anthropology 30. 129.	&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have encountered great difficulty coming up with explanations of how prehistoric people first stumbled upon the idea of the possibility of representation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, D. (2002). Mind in the Cave. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeo-optical explanation is that images projected inside a dwelling space provided, according to Cambridge professor Nigel Spivey, “… a prototypical visual experience that triggers the concept of representation…”&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence, E-mail from Nigel Spivey to Matt Gatton sent on Monday, March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the images would be shared experiences, visible by everyone in the tent or structure at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W., and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic.” In the Official Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Lisbon 2006, Global State of the Art--SO7 (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) Oxford: Archaeopress. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group could thus collectively experience, discuss, verify, confirm, investigate, and interpret the images projected on the surfaces before them. It is the communal aspect of the images that makes the development of visual art socially feasible.

“A randomly projected image stands for a real object; it says bison without being a flesh and blood bison, planting the idea of a referent, the conceptual beginning of art.” -Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura” in Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faith====
It is also possible that camera obscura images could have fostered religious belief. A broad definition of religion is a belief in an alternative realm that influences physical reality. Theologian Rudolf Otto held that the origins of religion are to be found in the concept of the sacred, the divine presenting itself as something “wholly other” (ganz andere).&lt;ref&gt;Otto, R. (1950 ed.). The idea of the holy; an inquiry into the non-rational factor in the idea of the divine and its relation to the rational [Harvey, J.W., trans.]. New York: Oxford University Press, 1950 ed. Originally published in German as Das Heilige (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The images projected in Paleolithic tents would have offered an early gateway to the concept of an alternative realm, a glimpse of an "other", that initiated a belief in something that was not seen moment to moment. The images, once seen, lingered in the mind, and took root in the culture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The camera’s image instantly splits a quasi-reality away from reality, peeling off an ‘other’ from the ‘is’; instilling the very idea that animals, plants, and humans have existences in other forms, spirits, on other planes.” - Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once the concept of an alternative realm had taken root, it would have provided a domain for agents of an "other" world to intervene in human affairs. The notion of spirit forms is the very root of animism, the oldest known, and perhaps first, form of religion. The incidental image is possibly the first glimpse of the "divine".&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy====

The core issue of metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. The images in a Paleolithic tent would trigger a cascade of thoughts about the essence of reality: What is ''that'' plane of existence? And reflexively, what is ''this'' plane?&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only by glimpsing an alternative reality does this reality become open to question — the very start of abstract examination.

====Schematicized distortions====
The projections by camera obscura can also explain some common features among cave paintings of animals and people. Paleolithic [[Cave painting|cave art]] is well known for iconic, schematicized figures, usually with extremely small heads and enormous, often bowed, bodies. Examples of the core elements of some Paleolithic cultures’ visual lexicon — repetition, disconnection, movement, superimposition, and distortion — are expressed in engravings on flat stones and bones within the habitation sites and also on the walls of deep caves.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “The Camera and the Cave: Understanding the style of Palaeolithic art.” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 5 (Feliks, J., ed.) September–October.

In May 2005, Matt Gatton, Walter Brock, and Dylan Brock set up a room-sized camera obscura on a farm in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The image of a horse was projected on to a small flat stone. It was natural for the artist to catch the image with his torso, the engraving stone secured against the body, and the eyes looking down on the inverted image. In this scenario it was advantageous to tilt the stone slightly. The more the stone was tilted the more the image of the animal distorted, the animal’s head reducing in size and the stomach bowing downward, quite like the distortions seen in some deep cave art.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distortion is known as the [[keystone effect]]. Gatton proposed that the deep cave distortions may have resulted from the camera obscura effects within the tents.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Drawing experiments” in “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleolithic archaeo-optic concepts in wider culture ===

The hypothesis that paleolithic people would have seen camera obscura effects within their shelters—Gatton’s Paleolithic Camera Obscura Theory—has gained wider exposure in the last several years, including specific references in the following venues.

==Neolithic archaeological optics==
The [[Neolithic]] period offers the possibility to explore optical image projections within built architecture. Neolithic structures range from modest houses to enormous enclosures and mounds, and were constructed using combinations of earth, timber and stone. Archaeo-optic fieldwork has focused upon [[megalithic]] monuments.

=== Megalithic structures ===
Megaliths, or large stones, come in two main types of architectural presentations: freestanding and earth-covered. Individual and groupings of standing stones  — in formations of circles, lines, ovals, ‘U’-shapes, or rectangles — were not employed to support the weight of soil above them, but served as markers. Megalithic chambers designed to bear the weight of a mound of earth, turf, rubble or stone have been classified into groups, including [[dolmen]]s, portal dolmens, [[gallery grave]]s, [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tombs]], [[passage tomb]]s, and [[Court cairn|court tombs]]. The term "dolmen" describes groupings of erected stones supporting one large, flat roof stone, like an oversized rudimentary table. "Portal dolmens" have an angled stone slab supported by uprights that define a chamber, often with an entrance. "Gallery" graves are elongated dolmens consisting of two rows of upright stones (orthostats) supporting a series of flat roof stones (lintels). "Wedge" tombs are wider at the mouth, and narrower as they recede inward. "Passage tombs" have a long boulder-built passage that leads to a buried chamber. "Court" tombs are so-named because they have what appears to be a courtyard encircled by standing stones in front of the tomb chamber. Although many of these structures now appear as freestanding monuments, their stones were often the skeletal substructures of mounds removed by erosion or human action.

A major focus for megalithic chambers is in western Europe: Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, and Iberia. Their origin, chronology and purpose is a subject of ongoing research and debate. In fact, they are not limited to Europe, and are found across Eurasia and the entire globe. Their significance in past cultures is suggested by the labor and resources required to create them. The painstakingly and intricately constructed mounds were significant feats, requiring tens of thousands of hours to construct. For example, it has been speculated that a workforce of 400 working continuously for two months every year would have taken around 16 years to construct the 200,000 tonne cairn at Newgrange.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London: Thames and Hudson. 117-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British Isles and Ireland it is possible that many different kinds of chambered monument, including those constructed from timber, may have been suited to the creation of optical phenomenon. Recent studies have focused upon one format in particular: the megalithic passage tomb.

====Passage tombs====
Passage tombs comprise a single stone-built passageway that gives access to a central chamber, and there may be adjoining chambers or cells. This structure is entirely covered by a mound that might consist of earth, rubble, turf or clay. Their distribution extends across the west of Europe. Determining the exact numbers of these sites is problematic due to the poor preservation of many. There are over one hundred and fifty proven passage tombs in Ireland, with an overall estimate of over three hundred in total,&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  roughly five hundred in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Nualláin, S.Ó. (1979). “The Megalithic Tombs of Ireland” in Expedition 21, no. 3, University of Pennsylvania. 11. See also Møder med Danmarks oldtid (2011) (exhibition). National Museet, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;  and over 250 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, A.S. and Ritchie, J.N.G. (2001). The Chambered Cairns of the Central Highlands. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification has been further divided into groups such as the Orkney-Cromarty, Maeshowe and Clava traditions, but all retain the same fundamental format. Their construction likely began in the earlier Neolithic soon after 5600 BP&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1991). The Chambered Cairns of Caithness. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  and extends to around 4000 BP at excavated examples of Clava Cairn passage tombs,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A new investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  but this need not imply that they were constructed or used throughout this time.

====Passage tomb Preservation====
The survival of passage tombs is variable and dependent upon many factors. The excavation of two later Neolithic passage graves at Balnuaran of Clava demonstrated that their architecture was inherently unstable and would have likely collapsed within decades of their construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley. R. (1998). “Architecture, Imagination and the Neolithic world.” In Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory, (Mithen, S., ed.). London: Routledge. 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier examples, including the Orkney-Cromarty format, appear to generally have been more robust. Passage tombs could also be reused in later times, including the Iron Age and early Medieval, and their Neolithic content was sometimes removed. Some were destroyed when new structures were built upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hingley, R. (1996). “Ancestors and identity in the later prehistory of Atlantic Scotland: the reuse and reinvention of Neolithic monuments and material culture.” In World Archaeology 28. 231-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most have required consolidation, reconstruction or strengthening to allow public access. In the Boyne Valley, Newgrange and Knowth have undergone significant excavation and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;   In Orkney, the roof of the chamber within Maeshowe has been restored following damage caused by Vikings in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, recent building work has significantly altered their appearance, a critical factor that has to be taken into account when observing and interpreting optical phenomena within their passages and chambers.

====Conundrum of use====
Passage tombs across Europe have long been a focus for myths and legends. Medieval lore has it that wizards, giants, witches, or demons erected the great stones, and that the mounds were the homes of gnomes, elves, faeries, and goblins.&lt;ref&gt;Burl, A. (1999). Circles of Stone: The Prehistoric Rings of Britain and Ireland. London: Harvill Press. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Denmark, passage graves are still referred to as jættestuer (troll houses). An analysis of Irish folk tales revealed that megalithic mounds both served as the burial places of ancient heroes, and were the abodes of supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many passage tombs do indeed contain the remains of the dead—sometimes in significant quantities. For example, excavations at [[Chambered cairn#Maeshowe|Quanterness]] revealed the bones of 157 individuals of various ages, but the total number held within the tomb may have been nearer to 400.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains and artifacts are also found at some sites, including beads, stone balls and pottery.

It appears that burial was not the sole function of passage "tombs". Some sites contain little evidence of human remains, although this could reflect their subsequent histories, while others have evidence for activities by the living. Fires were burnt within sites in Orkney&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and at Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange in Ireland there are examples where images were carved in situ upon stones within their interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. (2004). “By Way of Illustration: Art, Memory and Materiality in the Irish Sea and Beyond.” In The Neolithic of the Irish Sea: Materiality and Traditions of Practice, (Cummings, V. and Fowler, C., eds.) Oxford: Oxbow. 202-13.&lt;/ref&gt;    The passages at a number of sites align with sunrise or sunset at pivotal times of the year causing their otherwise darkened chambers to be illuminated. Many demonstrate extraordinary acoustic properties. Together, these factors suggest that passage tombs might be interpreted as venues for diverse activities that involved both the living and the dead.

=== The use of passage tombs as camera obscuras ===
The principal fieldwork exploring the optical properties of passage tombs has been conducted by Matt Gatton in Denmark, Morgan Saletta in France, Aaron Watson in Wales, Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott in Scotland, and Eva Bosch in Spain.

====Format====
The format of passage tombs is uniquely suited to the creation and control of optical projections. These structures reproduce the fundamental format of a camera obscura&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  and fieldwork has demonstrated that they can indeed have remarkable projection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chamber offers a dark space while the single passageway enables the movement of light to be closely controlled. In some cases their basic configuration alone is sufficient to cast a projection,&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a small number offer mechanisms through which light can be closely controlled. For example, the roof-box at Newgrange has evidence for the repeated relocation of quartz blocks that could have been used to manipulate optical projections.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of cases, however, additional apertures were required.

====Restricted access====
The entrances at many passage tombs appear to have been temporarily sealed in a variety of ways: boulders, slabs, blocks, planks or wooden frameworks, as evidenced by postholes by the entrance. Maeshowe has a recess near to the passage entrance that holds a carefully balanced portal stone that can be pivoted into place.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 51.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves a narrow gap between the top of this block and the passage lintels, thereby allowing light to enter even when the passageway is impassable to people.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the roof box at Newgrange is situated above the passageway, as is a comparable feature within Cairn G at Carrowkeel. These apertures could be operated independently to the passages. Even in the absence of such devices only minor additions - stone blocks, a hole in a wooden plank, or an animal hide hung between posts at the entrance - are required to convert the monument into an operational camera obscura. The passage serves as a conduit for light and the rear of the chamber acts as a projection surface.

====Aperture plane====
The character of optical projections within passage tombs is determined by a number of interconnected factors. Lighting inside the monument needs to be low but total darkness is not always required, depending on the relative brightness outside.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Palaeo-camera and the Concept of Representation.” In Pleistocene Coalition News 2 (3). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W. and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The Case for Image Projection in the Palaeolithic.” In Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Global State of the Art (SO7), BAR S2108, (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) 135-41. Oxford: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt;    Observations at the Grey Cairns of Camster by Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott showed that it was possible to cast projections in fog, rain and under heavy cloud, but that such conditions significantly impaired their clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size and brightness of projections can be adjusted both by modifying the size of the aperture and moving the aperture plane itself in relation to the focal plane, which is frequently the wall of the chamber aligned with the passageway. Increasing the focal distance by moving the aperture along the passage increases the size of the projection but also reduces its brightness. Reducing the aperture diameter results in a more focused, but increasingly dark, image. A further contributing factor is the texture of the surface upon which the image is projected. For example, observations by Aaron Watson have revealed that the slab that constitutes the back wall of the chamber at Bryn Celli Ddu is smooth enough to carry a detailed image.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, projections inside Cuween Hill fall upon rough stone walling, requiring the distance between the aperture and focal plane to be increased, thereby enlarging the image in order to render it visible.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of images projected within Neolithic passage tombs ===

====Images of the sun====
When aligned upon the sun, a properly configured passage tomb is capable of casting an enlarged image of the solar disc. As long as the aperture remains static this projected solar disc will move along the wall as the sun moves across the sky. During sunrise, for example, the sun’s image will appear to travel across the chamber and then out along the walls of the passageway. Gatton has suggested that images carved upon the chamber walls of Cairn T at Loughcrew may reproduce these movements of the sun’s disc.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, archaeologist Morgan Saletta reported solar projections within the sites of Grotte de Bounias and Grotte de la Source during equinoctial sunsets. These were a result of the architectural format of these monuments creating sufficiently restricted apertures to cast a distinct, though unfocused, projection.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M.  (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of midsummer sunrise in 2014 and 2015, Aaron Watson documented solar projections within Bryn Celli Ddu. By locating the aperture close to the chamber it was possible to cast a distinct image of nearby trees and the rising sun, together framed by the outline of the passage. In contrast, relocating the aperture to the passage entrance significantly enlarged the sun’s disc to a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of aligned monuments====
If a passage tomb is aligned upon another monument, the camera obscura method can be used to project recognisable images of that monument into the chamber. For example, while the setting sun shines directly into Maeshowe’s chamber when the sun is at its southwestern extreme (winter solstice sunset), there is also a reverse alignment (summer solstice sunrise) when the sun is at its northeastern extreme. This will illuminate the distant Barnhouse Stone such that its image could be projected inside Maeshowe’s chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Balnuaran of Clava, two neighbouring passage tombs share a south-westerly axis in order that their passageways open towards the midwinter sunset.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only does the cairn to the south-west appear centrally framed when looking down the passage from that to the north-east, but fieldwork by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips has documented how the midwinter setting sun appears to descend directly into the apex of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” In Current Archaeology 165. 332-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of the landscape====
Many passage tombs are set in elevated situations with extensive views, or even focused upon distinctive topographic features. These would therefore appear within optical projections inside their chambers. Aaron Watson has documented optical projections inside Cuween Hill, Orkney, that feature expansive views across the Bay of Firth. Inside the Dwarfie Stane, also in Orkney, it is possible to cast a panoramic image of the uplands of Hoy.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of passage tombs may have lost their lintels and roofs it is possible to consider the views that may originally have been projected into their chambers. For example, the ruinous site of Badnabay, north-west Scotland, appears to be aligned upon a mountain with a distinctive profile.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of people====
Reflected sunlight can illuminate people located within passage tomb forecourts, creating what Gatton has described as "spirit" projections due to their ephemeral, spectral qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  When backlit these figures appear as dark silhouettes, but at those times when the sun is behind the monument, and the forecourt area brightly lit, they are enhanced in color and detail. Aaron Watson has photographed optical projections of people inside Cuween Hill, Wideford Hill, Vinquoy Hill, the Dwarfie Stane and the Grey Cairns of Camster.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera obscura projections are animated in a manner akin to cinematography and, while projected human figures appear upside down and back to front, they move in real time. This creates distinctive illusions where individuals, or even groups of people, can appear to emerge from the chamber wall. As the angles between the external subject and the aperture become increasingly oblique, projections can also be cast upon the floor, walls and ceiling of a monument. This can create the illusion of a human shadow moving through the passage tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immersive multisensory experiences within passage tombs ===
Passage tomb architecture spatially constrains the number of people who can simultaneously occupy their chambers, effectively restricting access to specialist kinds of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (1992). “Monuments, Movement and the Context of Megalithic Art.” In Vessels for the Ancestors, (Sharples, N. and Sheridan, A., Eds.) Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  and unusual combinations of sensory experience. Whether these sites embody astronomical orientations, occupy special places in the landscape, or acted as the receptacles for ancestral remains, the camera obscura theory expands the significance and meaning of light entering these monuments.

Inverted images of the outside world, viewed by people located in the depths of a megalithic cairn, would very effectively generate a sense of "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, people in the Neolithic did not share present-day knowledge of optical physics, and would have had their own understandings. Even from a scientific perspective, however, the act of witnessing the projection of the sun’s disc, or human figures emerging from a stone wall, is rather suggestive of an encounter with the supernatural. It has been suggested that projections of the sun may have been interpreted as the manifestation of a Neolithic solar deity.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, optical projections converge with other sensory qualities of these places, potentially including the presence of the remains of the dead, rock art, and dynamic archaeo-acoustic sound effects. There is also a possibility that these kinds of experiences were combined and choreographed in order to maximize their theatrical impact upon an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2001). “The Sounds of Transformation: Acoustics, Monuments and Ritual in the British Neolithic.” In The Archaeology of Shamanism, (Price, N., ed.) London: Routledge. 178-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than silent places of the death, passage tombs may have acted as places where people could engage with powerful multi-sensory experiences that transported their occupants to other dimensions, or brought them into the presence of forces that are difficult to imagine in the present day.

==Ancient Egyptian funerary monuments==
The Ancient Egyptians may have also witnessed—and recorded—camera obscura effects. Ancient Egyptian texts, known collectively as the [[Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld|Books of the Netherworld]], describe pharaonic funerary complexes as sun-powered resurrection machines that somehow affected a merger of the pharaoh's soul with the sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, M. (1997). The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient Mysteries. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 20. For an explanation of how the sun sets off the resurrection process see page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continuation of the entire cosmos was dependent upon the sun god who was regenerated in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. (1999). Akhenaten and the Religion of Light [David Lorton, trans.] Ithaca: Cornell University Press. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptian concept of the pharaonic soul was complicated and divided into several aspects. The [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka .28vital spark.29|''ka'' aspect]] was a spirit double, created at birth, with the physical appearance of the person. After death, the ''ka'' would leave the body and travel through the underworld at night and return to its physical representation (the mummy, statue, or artworks) each morning. [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] mortuary temples, which faced east toward the dawn sun and were affixed to the side of [[pyramid]]s during the pyramid building era, featured a darkened inner sanctuary with a ''ka'' statue of the pharaoh. When the sun rose on the horizon, its rays would travel down the central passageway of the temple, and project the image of the sun onto the ''ka'' and, conversely, reflect the ''ka'' back to the sun, uniting the two.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the conceptual leap that underpins Ancient Egyptian culture — the pharaoh’s soul road on a beam of light.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek mystery cult rites==
Mystery religions dominated the Mediterranean sphere during classical antiquity. The foremost Mystery sect was the hallowed rite of the Goddess [[Persephone]] at Eleusis, Greece, which held sway for nearly two thousand years (from at least 1500 BCE until the end of fourth century CE). The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] started out as a small localized religion, grew steadily, and were adopted as part of the state religion of nearby Athens around 600 BCE.

Inside the dark cavernous temple was a sacred smaller building that held cult objects, normally sculptural idols, and a very bright fire. In the temple, the initiates had a direct face-to-face experience with the gods, who appeared as phantoms of light. Plato describes initiates experiencing “perfect, simple, calm, and blissful apparitions [eudaímona phásmata] in a pure light …” ([[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D250c 250c]).

The optical principle of the camera obscura — an image cast into a dark area from an adjacent bright area via a small aperture — works irrespective of the scale of the dark and light areas. If the inside of a room is made very bright and the outside is very dark then a hole will cast the image from the smaller space to the larger, rather like a movie projector in a theater.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Gatton has proposed the priests (or priestesses) at Eleusis had operated a rudimentary projection booth, an "Eleusinian Projector", where the priest’s holy fire-room acted as the box of light and the dark cavernous space crowded with initiates was the theater.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The initiates were not directing their attention toward the priest or the sacred house, but looking the other direction at spectral images that they believed were gods, shining and moving about…” 	-Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">'''Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State''' is a project funded by the [[European Research Council]] with research carried out at the [[British Museum]], the [[British Library]], [[SOAS, University of London]], and [[Leiden University]]. The leading researchers are Dr. Michael Willis, Dr. Sam van Schaik, Dr. [[Nathan W. Hill]] and Dr. Peter Bisschop.&lt;ref&gt;https://asiabeyondboundaries.org/about/ (Retrieved June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The project was one of thirteen synergy grants awarded in 2013 and the only synergy grant in the humanities for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1270_en.htm |title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - ERC Synergy Grants: 13 frontier research projects to get €150 million |publisher=Europa.eu |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project will run from 2014 to 2020.

[[File:South Asia in 400 CE.tif|thumb|Map of south Asia in ''circa'' 400 CE showing principal kingdoms and city states]]

==Objectives==
The project is focussing on the history and culture of early medieval India, specifically the period of the [[Gupta]] dynasty (''circa'' 320-510 CE). Although characterised as a ‘golden age’ in modern scholarship — and marked by developments that shaped South Asia for more than a thousand years — research on this pivotal moment is fragmented and compartmentalised. The purpose of the project is to move beyond these limitations and to recover a more compelling picture of this influential period and its impact on India and her neighbours. The project achieves this aim through the development of online research tools, a series of workshops, and publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.soas.ac.uk/south-asia-institute/events/asia-beyond-boundaries/ (Retrieved June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Aims==
The project is interdisciplinary in design and aims to: 
* Investigate the constitution of the Gupta kingdom and its relationship with surrounding states
* Chart the polities that flourished concurrently in central and southeast Asia
* Define and analyse specific appropriations inspired by Indian examples and map how Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali, the media of political and religious discourse, came to be used across Asia beside regional languages such as [[Pyu]], [[Kannada]] and [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]]
* Scrutinize how temples and monasteries emerged as autonomous socio-economic institutions with stable endowments, thereby possessing the resources needed to become long-standing trans-regional nodes of learning, ritual practice

==Research Themes and Open Sources==
Concerns about prevailing 'silos of knowledge' emerged primarily in management studies in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Lessard, Donald R., and Srilata Zaheer. "Breaking the Silos: Distributed Knowledge and Strategic Responses to Volatile Exchange Rates." ''Strategic Management Journal'' 17, no. 7 (1996): 513-33. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486730.&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis has had little impact beyond the commercial sector, however, especially in cultural and historical research where modern nation states, regional languages, and established disciplinary protocols have reinforced the [[status quo]]. In moving beyond these constraints, three research themes have been developed to cross the disciplines and regions covered by the project. The project design involves making all core data and analysis freely available online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">{{about|the linguistic term||Bongo Bongo Land}}
'''Bongo-Bongo''' in [[linguistics]] is used as a name for an [[imaginary language]]. It is most commonly invoked in [[Etymology|etymological studies]] to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a name for a [[constructed language]] invented by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] as a teaching tool in linguistics.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;Murray, N. ''Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates'' [[Cambridge University Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|978-0521128469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological studies==
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term ''Bongo-Bongo approach'' or ''Bongo-Bongo effect''.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; For example, when comparing random [[Underlying representation|surface forms]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as ''hegi'' (Basque for "ridge") and ''hegy'' (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Anthropology==
The concept can also be found occasionally in [[anthropology]] where the ''Bongo-Bongo'' are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, [[Bongo Bongo Land]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kippenberg, HG (ed) ''Concepts of Person in Religion and Thought (Religion and Reason, No 37)'' [[Walter de Gruyter|de Gruyter]] (1990) {{ISBN|978-3110121599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''

*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

{{Expert-subject|literature|date=February 2012}}
'''Chiastic structure''', or '''chiastic pattern''', is a [[literary technique]] in [[motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s and other textual passages.  An example of chiastic structure would be two ideas, A and B, together with variants A' and B', being presented as A,B,B',A'.  Alternative names{{cn|date=August 2015}} include '''ring structure''', because the opening and closing 'A' can be viewed as completing a circle, '''palistrophe''',&lt;ref&gt;The term "palistrophe" was coined in:  {{citation |first= Sean E. |last= McEvenue |title= The Narrative Style of the Priestly Writer |publisher= Biblical Institute Press |place= Rome |year= 1971 |oclc= 292126 }}.{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or symmetric structure. It may be regarded as [[chiasmus]] scaled up from clauses to larger units of text.

These often [[symmetric]]al patterns are commonly found in ancient literature such as the [[epic poetry]] of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Classicist Bruno Gentili describes this technique as "the cyclical, circular, or 'ring' pattern (''ring composition''). Here the idea that introduced a compositional section is repeated at its conclusion, so that the whole passage is framed by material of identical content"&lt;ref&gt;Gentili, Bruno, ''Poetry and Its Public in Ancient Greece: From Homer to the Fifth Century'', trans. A. Thomas Cole (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), 48&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile in classical prose, scholars often find chiastic narrative techniques in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Herodotus frequently uses ring composition or ‘epic regression’ as a way of supplying background information for something discussed in the narrative. First an event is mentioned briefly, then its precedents are reviewed in reverse chronological order as far back as necessary; at that point the narrative reverses itself and moves forward in chronological order until the event in the main narrative line is reached again."&lt;ref&gt;Boedeker, Deborah. "Epic Heritage and Mythical Patterns in Herodotus." Published in ''Companion to Herodotus'', ed. Egbert J. Bakker, Irene J. F. de Jong, and Hans van Wees (Brill, 2002), 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Various chiastic structures are also seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Quran]]. 

Chiastic structures also appear in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]]. The [[contrapposto]] technique of sculpture in Ancient Greek sculpture often lead to this chiastic structure, such as in the [[Diadumenos]] of [[Polykleitos]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Chiastic.svg|thumb|120px|When read left to right, up to down, the first topic (A) is reiterated as the last, and the middle concept (B) appears twice in succession. (Also, the middle concept could appear just once.)]]
The term ''chiastic'' derives from the mid-17th century term [[chiasmus]], which refers to a ''crosswise arrangement'' of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. ''Chiasmus'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''khiasmos'', a word that is ''khiazein'', marked with the letter ''[[Chi (letter)|khi]]''. From ''khi'' comes ''chi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Chiasmus |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiasmus |work=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chi'' is made up of two lines crossing each other as in the shape of an ''X''. The line that starts leftmost on top, comes down, and  is rightmost on the bottom, and vice versa. If one thinks of the lines as concepts, one sees that concept A, which comes first, is also last, and concept B, which comes after A, comes before A. If one adds in more lines representing other concepts, one gets a chiastic structure with more concepts.
See Proverbs 1:20-33; vs 20-21=A, v 22=B, v 23=C, vs 24-25=D, vs 26-28=E, vs 29-30=D', v 31=C', v 32=B', v 33=A'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|1993|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemonic device==
[[Oral literature]] is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. In his study of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], Cedric Whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure "of the most amazing virtuosity" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Cedric M. |last= Whitman |title= Homer and the Heroic Tradition |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |year= 1958 |oclc= 310021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Hebrew Bible==

{{main|Book of Daniel#Chiasm in the Aramaic section}}

In 1986, [[William H. Shea]] proposed that the [[Book of Daniel]] is composed of a ''double-chiasm''. He argued that the chiastic structure is emphasized by the two languages that the book is written in: [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew]]. The first chiasm is written in ''Aramaic'' from chapters 2-7 following an ABC...CBA pattern. The second chiasm is in ''Hebrew'' from chapters 8-12, also using the ABC...CBA pattern. However, Shea represents Daniel 9:26 as "D", a break in the center of the pattern.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1986|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Wenham]] has analyzed the [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood narrative]] and has shown that it is essentially an elaborate chiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "The Coherence of the Flood Narrative" ''Vetus Testamentum'' 28 (1978) 336–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the earlier study of grammatical structure by F. I.  Andersen,&lt;ref&gt;F. I. Andersen, ''The Sentence in Biblical Hebrew'' (The Hague, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham illustrated a chiastic structure as displayed in the following two tables.

{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiastic structure of the Genesis Flood Narrative
|-
|A: Noah and his sons (Gen 6:10)
:B: All life on earth (6:13:a)
::C: Curse on earth (6:13:b)
:::D: Flood announced (6:7)
::::E: Ark (6:14-16)
:::::F: All living creatures (6:17–20 )
::::::G: Food (6:21)
:::::::H: Animals in man’s hands (7:2–3)
::::::::I: Entering the Ark (7:13–16)
:::::::::J: Waters increase (7:17–20)
::::::::::X: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::::::::J: Waters decrease (8:13–14)
::::::::I': Exiting the Ark (8:15–19) 
:::::::H': Animals (9:2,3)
::::::G': Food (9:3,4)
:::::F': All living creatures (9:10a)
::::E':  Ark (9:10b)
:::D’:No flood in future (9:11)
::C': Blessing on earth (9:12–17)
:B': All life on earth (9:16)
A: Noah and his sons (9:18,19a)
|}

Within this overall structure, there is a numerical mini-chiasm of 7s, 40s, and 150s:
{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiasm of the numbers 7, 40, and 150
|-
|α: Seven days waiting to enter Ark (7:4)
:β: Second mention of seven days waiting (7:10)
::γ: 40 days (7:17)
:::δ: 150 days (7:24)
::::χ: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::δ': 150 days (8:3)
::γ': 40 days (8:6)
:β': Seven days waiting for dove (8:10)
α': Second seven days waiting for dove (8:12)
|}

The two mentions of the 150 days refer to the same period, and the first 40 days (7:13,17) are part of the 150 days. All this is consistent with the date in 8:4. There was no compelling reason to repeat the first 7-day figure of waiting to enter the Ark except for the corresponding two 7-day figures for the dove. The second mention of the 150 days was also because of the chiasmus. The chiastic structure explains the repetition of these figures. Before these ancient literary conventions were recognized, followers of the [[Documentary Hypothesis]] explained the repetition by hypothesizing two different authors or redactors (J or Jahwist and P or Priestly sources). The repetition may also show the literary artistry of a single author or editor, either working from one tradition or weaving together the J and P sources in chiastic fashion.

==Use in the Quran==

While there are many examples of chiastic structure in the Quran, perhaps the most well known is in the 'Verse of the Throne' or 'Ayat al-Kursi'. The verse contains 9 sentences which exhibit chiasmus, but perhaps more interesting is that it is found in the longest chapter of the Quran, [[Al-Baqara]], which itself contains a fractal chiastic structure in its 286 verses, i.e. where each (outer) chiasm is composed of (inner) chiastic structures reflected in some sense in the analogue outer chiasm. One such analysis of the chapter is shown below (from &lt;ref&gt;Abu Zakariya, "Ring Theory: the Quran’s Structural Coherence", September 21 2015, https://www.islam21c.com/islamic-thought/ring-theory-the-qurans-structural-coherence/ &lt;/ref&gt;; alternate and/or more detail analyses can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Raymond K.

==ABC…CBA pattern==

===''Beowulf''===
In literary texts with a possible [[Oral literature|oral]] origin, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', chiastic or ring structures are often found on an intermediate level, that is, between the (verbal and/or grammatical) level of [[chiasmus]] and the higher level of chiastic structure such as noted in the Torah. John D. Niles provides examples of chiastic figures on all three levels.&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that for the instances of ll. 12–19, the announcement of the birth of (Danish) Beowulf, are chiastic, more or less on the verbal level, that of chiasmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each of the three main fights are organized chiastically, a chiastic structure on the level of verse paragraphs and shorter passages. For instance, the simplest of these three, the fight with [[Grendel]], is schematized as follows:

A: Preliminaries
*Grendel approaching
*Grendel rejoicing
*Grendel devouring Handscioh
:B: Grendel's wish to flee ("fingers cracked")
::C: Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:::HEOROT IN DANGER OF FALLING
::C': Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:B': "Joints burst"; Grendel forced to flee
A': Aftermath
*Grendel slinking back toward fens
*Beowulf rejoicing
*Beowulf left with Grendel's arm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=925–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Niles provides a diagram of the highest level of chiastic structure, the organization of the poem as a whole, in an introduction, three major fights with interludes before and after the second fight (with Grendel's mother), and an epilogue. To illustrate, he analyzes Prologue and Epilogue as follows:

'''Prologue'''&lt;br&gt;
A: Panegyric for [[Scyld]]&lt;br&gt;
:B: Scyld's funeral
::C: History of Danes before [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]]
:::D: Hrothgar's order to build [[Heorot]]

'''Epilogue'''&lt;br&gt;
:::D': Beowulf's order to build his barrow
::C': History of [[Geats]] after Beowulf ("messenger's prophecy")
:B': Beowulf's funeral
A': Eulogy for Beowulf&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|p=930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Paradise Lost''===
The overall chiastic structure of  [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' is also of the ABC…CBA type:

A: Satan's sinful actions (Books 1–3)&lt;br&gt;
:B: Entry into Paradise (Book 4)
::C: War in heaven (destruction) (Books 5–6)
::C': Creation of the world (Books 7–8)
:B': Loss of paradise (Book 9)

{{Collecting Hobby}}

The [[hobby]] of '''collecting''' includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual ''collector''. Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others.

In collections of manufactured items, the objects may be [[antique]] or simply [[collectable]]. Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. The word ''vintage'' describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. Previously commonplace items that are now rare are called [[ephemera]].

Collecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.

==Types of collection==
[[File:Stamp album sleeve.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|Stamp album used for [[stamp collecting|collecting stamps]]]]
{{See also|list of collectables}}

The most obvious way to categorise collections is by the type of objects collected. Most collections are of manufactured commercial items, but natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies, rocks, and seashells can also be the subject of a collection. For some collectors, the criterion for inclusion might not be the type of object but some incidental property such as the identity of its original owner.

Some collectors are generalists with very broad criteria for inclusion, while others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others—called ''completists'' or ''completionists''—aim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek a limited number of items per category (e.g. one representative item per year of manufacture or place of purchase).&lt;ref&gt;For example, book collector [[Rush Hawkins]] (1831 – 1920) sought the first and second books from every European printer before 1501, while illuminated manuscript collector [[Henry Yates Thompson]] (1838 – 1928) maintained a collection of exactly 100 items, selling his least preferable items to make room for new ones.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of objects is important to some collectors but irrelevant to others. Some collectors maintain objects in pristine condition, while others use the items they collect.

==&lt;span id="Price guide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Value of collected items==
[[File:Herbert Kullmann May 1914 sale catalogue.jpg|thumbnail|Herbert Kullmann, picture sale catalogue by [[Bernheim-Jeune]], Paris, May 1914.]]

After a [[collectable]] has been purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value is linked to what is called the [[secondary market]]. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally paid for it. A ''price guide'' is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.

Products often become more valuable with age. The term ''[[antique]]'' generally refers to manufactured items made over 100 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] requires that an antique "must be over 100 years of age at the time of importation". {{Cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/359/kw/duty%20on%20antiques/session/L3RpbWUvMTUwODM1NjAyMC9zaWQvY3U0S012dm4%3D|title=Duty on personal and commercial imports of antiques, artwork|last=U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Information Center|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some fields, such as [[antique car]]s, the time frame is less stringent. For [[antique furniture]], the limit has traditionally been set in the 1830s. Collectors and dealers may use the word ''vintage'' to describe older collectables that are too young to be called antiques,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the arts and crafts sales website [[Etsy]] requires "vintage" items sold on their platform to be "at least 20 years old". {{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/help/article/4946/ref]|title=Vintage Items on Etsy|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Art Deco]] and [[Art Nouveau]] items, [[carnival glass|Carnival]] and [[depression glass|Depression]] glass, etc. Items which were once everyday objects but may now be collectable, as almost all examples produced have been destroyed or discarded, are called ''[[ephemera]]''.

==Psychological aspects==

Psychological factors can play a role in both the motivation for keeping a collection and the impact it has on the collector's life. These factors can be positive or negative.

The hobby of collecting often goes hand-in-hand with an interest in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting [[deltiology|postcards]] may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors even become experts in their field.

Maintaining a collection can be a relaxing activity that counteracts the stress of life, while providing a purposeful pursuit which prevents boredom. The hobby can lead to social connections between people with similar interests and the development of new friendships, it has also been shown to be particularly common among academics. 

Collecting for most people is a choice, but for some it can be a compulsion, sharing characteristics with [[Compulsive hoarding|obsessive hoarding]]. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

It has been speculated{{by who|date=August 2018}} that the widespread appeal of collecting is connected to the hunting and gathering that was once necessary for human survival. Collecting is also associated with memory by association and the need for the human brain to catalogue and organise information and give meaning to ones actions.

==History==
[[Image:Musei Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|350px|right|"Musei Wormiani Historia", the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] from the ''Museum Wormianum'' depicting [[Ole Worm]]'s cabinet of curiosities]]

Collecting is a practice with a very old cultural history. In [[Mesopotamia]], collecting practices have been noted among royalty and elites as far back as the third millennium, B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomason |first1=Alison Karmel Thomason |title=Luxury and Legitimation: Royal Collecting in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=2005 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |location=Hampshire, U.K. |isbn=0754602389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] collected books from all over the known world at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The Medici family, in Renaissance Florence, made the first effort to collect art by private patronage, this way artists could be free for the first time from the money given by the Church and Kings; this citizenship tradition continues today with the work of private art collectors. Many of the world's popular [[museum]]s—from the [http://www.metmuseum.org/ Metropolitan] in New York City to the [http://www.museothyssen.org/ Thyssen] in Madrid or the [http://www.franzmayer.org.mx/ Franz Mayer] in Mexico City—have collections formed by the generous collectors that donated them to be seen by the general public.

The collecting hobby is a modern descendant of the "[[cabinet of curiosities]]" which was common among scholars with the means and opportunities to acquire unusual items from the 16th century onwards. Planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back at least to [[George Thomason]] in the reign of Charles I and [[Samuel Pepys]] in that of Charles II. Collecting engravings and other prints by those whose means did not allow them to buy original works of art also goes back many centuries. The progress in 18th-century Paris of collecting both works of art and of ''curiosité'', dimly echoed in the English ''curios'', and the origins in Paris, Amsterdam and London of the modern [[art market]] have been increasingly well documented and studied since the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chronologically some essential works are C. Blanc, ''Le trésor de la curiosité'' (1857-58), E. Bonnaffé, ''Les collectionneurs de l'ancienne France'' (1873), l. Courajod, ''La livre-journal de Lazare Duvaux'' (1873), L. Clément de Ris, ''Les amateurs d'autrefois'' (1877), A. Maze-Sencier, ''Le livre des collectionneurs'' (1893), G. Reitlinger ''The Economics of Taste'' (1961), G. Glorieux's monograph, ''À [[l'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of larger numbers of people in collecting activities comes with the prosperity and increased leisure for some in the later 19th century in industrial countries. That is when collecting such items as antique china, furniture and decorative items from oriental countries becomes established. The first price guide was the [[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons catalogue]] issued in November 1865.

===On the Internet===

The Internet offers many resources to any collector: personal sites presenting one's collection, online collectable catalogs, dealer/shops websites displaying their merchandise, Internet trading platforms, collector clubs, [[autograph club]], collector forums and collector mailing lists.

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space.

extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning.

PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks].

MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts from the literature==
Some high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

===Important categories of creativity===
Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George
|author2=Johnson, Mark

|year=2008
|publisher=University of Chicago press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful. [[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistic]] inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Creativity and the Brain, In: A Handbook of Creativity for Teachers.

Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

===Poetry===
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid gray; padding:5px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:right; background:lightyellow"&gt;
More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.&lt;br&gt;I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.&lt;br&gt;I need it for my dreams.
&lt;small&gt;Racter, from ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, San Francisco: Computer Music Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/introducing-mechanic-miner/|title=Introducing Mechanic Miner|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/why-i-think-mechanic-miner-is-exciting/|title=Why I Think Mechanic Miner Is Cool|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12770">[[File:Dramatism Pentad.png|thumbnail|A diagram of the dramatistic pentad  depicting Attitude as a derivative of Agent.]]
The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Educational entertainment''' (also referred to by the [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/edutainment |title=Definition of "Edutainment" |access-date=2015-02-14 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214122205/http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/edutainment |archive-date=2015-02-14 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''edutainment'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edutainment |title=edutainment |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113084132/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/edutainment |archive-date=2012-11-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is media designed to [[education|educate]] through [[entertainment]]. Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers' opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rapeepisarn |first1=K. |last2=Wong |first2=K.

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|format=pdf|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739.jpg|link=[[:File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739]].jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'']]
[[Poor Richard's Almanack|''Poor Richard’s Almanack'']] demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|title=Turning to Education for Fun|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2015-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-12|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105130008/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Diane Disney (1957). ''The Story of Walt Disney''. NY: Henry Holt and Co. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-0-7868-5562-9}}. As cited in Shale, Richard (1982). ''Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press. p. 15.{{ISBN|9780835713108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the [[United States|U.S.]] into [[World War II]] also had a major impact on the popularity of educational entertainment, as a relationship between Disney and the U.S. government formed; Disney was able to experiment with educational and nonfiction films in a way that continued even after the war,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II|last=Shale|first=Richard|publisher=UMI Research Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8357-1310-8|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=67, 109, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with series such as ''[[True-Life Adventures]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Walt and the Promise of Progress City|last=Gennawey|first=Sam|publisher=Ayefour Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0-615-54024-5|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walt Disney's Disneyland|''Disneyland'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=Catherine L.|title=The Strange Case of Dr. von Braun and Mr. Disney: Frontierland, Tomorrowland, and America’s Final Frontier|journal=The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=416–429|doi=10.3138/jrpc.25.3.416|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the transcript of an interview with [[Alexander P. de Seversky]] from The Walt Disney Archives, of which its date and interviewer is unknown,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the following quotation is found:{{Quote|text=It is a new kind of entertainment that goes far beyond simply "amusing" its audience.

With dramatic action it exposes the basic ideas that will rid the mind of confusion and clarify the war thinking of the public.|sign=Walt Disney|source=Interview with Alexander de Seversky}}Since the 1970s, various groups in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America have used edutainment to address health and social issues such as [[substance abuse]], [[immunization]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and [[cancer]]. Initiatives in major universities, such as [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Michael J.|first2=Cody|last3=Rogers|first3=Everett M.|last4=Sabido|first4=Miguel|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-1-135-62456-9|location=|pages=7, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[NGOs]] such as PCI-Media Impact, and government agencies such as the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/|title=Entertainment Education {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120135351/https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/ToolsTemplates/EntertainmentEd/|archivedate=2017-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced edutainment content.

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|title=EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN FACTUAL NATURE PICTURES|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.&lt;ref name="elysianworld2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archivedate=December 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.&lt;ref name="edutainer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter &amp; Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|,]] which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archivedate=2017-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article [["Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning"]] Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1491447|title=Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning|first=Ralph S.|last=Izard|date=12 May 1967|publisher=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=45|issue=1|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,&lt;ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millefeuille about psoriasis&lt;ref name="Millefeuille"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.&lt;ref name="This is Axiom"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002413 | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&amp;nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, B., Park, H., &amp; Baek, Y. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers and Education, 52, 800-810&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archivedate=2017-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2006|isbn=3-540-25093-X|location=|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.&lt;ref name="Onion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &amp;#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archivedate=November 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."&lt;ref name="Onion2" /&gt;

=== Theme parks ===
{{Main|Amusement park#Educational theme parks}}
[[File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT.jpg|link=[[:File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT]].jpg|thumb|[[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], an attraction at [[Epcot]]]]
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dream It! Do It!: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms|last=Sklar|first=Marty|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4231-7406-6|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|access-date=|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=0-385-48975-7|location=|pages=485–499|doi=|id=|coauthors=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|url=|journal=Issues in Informing Science &amp; Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 1–13|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|url=|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/165165|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S. A.|last3=Smilek|first3=Daniel|date=2013-01-01|title=The way we encounter reading material influences how frequently we mind wander|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00892/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|page=892|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00892|issn=1664-1078|pmid=24348444|pmc=3842750|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409030804/http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00892/abstract|archivedate=2016-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''. Heinemann. {{ISBN|978-0-434-59300-2}} {{oclc|14271773}}. As cited in Beato, Greg (2015-03-19).

Retrieved 2017-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on "the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balloffet|first=Pierre|last2=Courvoisier|first2=François H.|last3=Lagier|first3=Joelle|date=2014|title=From Museum to Amusement Park: The Opportunities and Risks of Edutainment|url=|journal=International Journal of Arts Management|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A '''fiction-writing mode''' is a manner of writing with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.

[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA143 143-65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in ''Poetics'', referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, pp.  3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in ''The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing'' (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called ''fiction-writing modes''—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jessica Page Morrell, in ''Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing'' (2006), mentioned six ''delivery modes'': action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Peter Selgin, in ''By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers'' (2007), mentioned five writing ''methods'': action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.&lt;ref&gt;Selgin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Mike Klaassen, in ''Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life'' (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
{{main article|Narration}}
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term "narration" as a [[rhetorical mode]] of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.

==Description==
[[Description]] is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story.  Together with [[dialogue]], narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.  Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition==
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}
Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information.  Exposition may be used to add [[drama]] to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kernen|Kernen]], 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarization==
[[:wikt:summarisation|Summarization]], or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA144 144-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "tell" in the [[axiom]] "[[Show, don't tell]]" is often in the form of summarization.  Summarization may be used to:

* connect parts of a story
* report details of less important events
* skip events that are irrelevant to the plot
* convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA145 145].&lt;/ref&gt;
* vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA140 140-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introspection==
{{main article|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Introspection may also be used to:
* enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen [[characterisation]]
* increase tension
* widen the scope of a story&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kress|Kress]], 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* play a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene and sequel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickham|Bickham]], 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA12 12-22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA50 50-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recollection==
[[Recollection]] is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character [[Memory|remembers]] a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying [[Back-story|backstory]] by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story.  Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool.  Recollection could be considered a subset of [[#Introspection|introspection]], but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.  Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.  For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA113 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensation==
[[Sensation (fiction)|Sensation]] is used to portray a character's [[perception]]s. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA173 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
The fiction-writing mode of [[emotion]] conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid|Reid]], 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kempton|Kempton]], 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayhE_0hlH34C&amp;pg=PA148 148].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA74 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Action (fiction)|Action]] is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA142 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt; and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
[[Transition (fiction)|Transitions]] in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. 
* ''Interiority''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt; includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Exteriority'' includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dialogue'' represents a character's speech: conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Activity'' includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">The '''Futures of American Studies''' is a weeklong academic summer institute dedicated to presenting new work and critiquing the field of [[American Studies]] held at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The first Futures of American Studies Institute was held in the summer of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The Futures of American Studies. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald E. Pease]], Professor of English at Dartmouth College, founded, organizes, and directs the annual Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Futures of American Studies,'' Edited by Donald E. Pease, Robyn Wiegman, Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2957-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of the Institute==
After the [[School of Criticism and Theory]] left Dartmouth for [[Cornell University]] in 1995, Dartmouth faculty member Donald E. Pease started the Futures Institute as an alternative summer program for faculty and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Futures Institute celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its founding.

==Institute Description==
The Institute is divided into two daily plenary sessions, which feature current work from Institute faculty, and multiple three-hour research seminars in which all participants present and discuss their own work-in-progress. Speakers in the plenary sessions typically examine the relation between emergent and residual practices in the field of American Studies from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Participants come from a variety of programs and schools and represent fields as diverse as American history, social geography, American literature, gender studies, and the digital humanities. The Institute welcomes participants who are involved in a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and who are interested in current critical debates in American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">The '''Glasgow Chronology''' is a proposed revision of the [[Egyptian chronology]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966). "[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1966_3_SpecialArticles.pdf Jewish Studies in American Liberal-Arts Colleges and Universities]," ''American Jewish Year Book'' 67 (1966), 1–30; here: p. 3.

Retrieved 2016-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as "the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries".&lt;ref&gt;Band (1966), p. 5. In the 2002 reprint, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985). ''World Register of University Studies in Jewish Civilization: Inventory of Holdings'' (Vol. 1). Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

===Europe===

====University College London====
[[University College London]] (UCL) houses the largest department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies in Europe. The department is the only one in the UK to offer a full degree course and research supervision in Jewish Studies at the BA Honours, MA, MPhil and PhD levels in every subject of Hebrew and Jewish Studies—philology, history, and literature—covering virtually the entire chronological and geographical span of the Hebrew and Jewish civilisation from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the modern period. As the first university in England to open its doors to Women, Roman Catholics and Dissenters, UCL was also the first to admit Jewish students. This traditional link of the College with the Anglo-Jewish community is very much alive today. Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (1778–1859), one of the leading figures in the struggle for Jewish emancipation in England, was among the principal founders of University College and the chief promotor of its Hebrew department. At his instigation, [[Hyman Hurwitz]] was appointed as the first Professor of Hebrew in 1828. In 1967 the department was renamed the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies and extended to include, in addition to the established courses in Hebrew language and literature, a much wider range of courses with an emphasis on Jewish history.

Along with general courses on Middle Eastern history and culture, students in the FAMES Hebrew programme study Hebrew language, literature, and culture of all periods (ancient, medieval, and modern). The teaching staff include [https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/faculty/biographies/hebrew specialists in each of these periods], including Dr. Aaron Hornkohl, Prof. Geoffrey Khan, Prof. Nicholas de Lange, Dr Yaron Peleg, and Dr. Michael Chaim Rand. A student may officially combine Hebrew with Arabic or a Modern European Language. 

====Birobidzhan Jewish National University====
The [[Birobidzhan Jewish National University]], a [[Russia]]n university, works in cooperation with the local Jewish community of [[Birobidzhan]]. The university is unique in the [[Russian Far East]].

In recent years,{{when|date=May 2014}} the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] has grown interested in its Jewish roots. Students study Hebrew and Yiddish at a Jewish school{{which|date=May 2014}} and Birobidzhan Jewish National University. In 1989, the Jewish center founded its [[Sunday school]], where children study[[Yiddish]], learn [[Jewish dance|Jewish folk dance]], and learn about the history of Israel. The [[Israeli government]] helps fund the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204084032/http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''laconic phrase''' or '''laconism''' is a concise or [[wikt:terse|terse]] statement, especially a [[wikt:blunt|blunt]] and [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptical]] rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms'', 1984, ''s.v.'' 'concise' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8N4UReTJYhUC&amp;pg=PA172 p. 172].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Percy Smith, ''Synonyms Discriminated'' (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=17sXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA541 p. 541].&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Laconia]], the region of Greece including the city of [[Sparta]], whose ancient inhabitants had a reputation for verbal austerity and were famous for their blunt and often [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] remarks.

==Uses==
A laconic phrase may be used for efficiency (as in [[military jargon]]), for emphasis, for philosophical reasons (especially among thinkers who believe in minimalism, such as [[Stoicism|Stoics]]), or to better deflate a pompous individual.

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|138px|left|[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] ([[Hellenistic art#Later Roman copies|Roman copy]] of a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] bust)]]
A prominent example involves [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedon]]. After invading southern Greece and receiving the submission of other key [[city-state]]s, he turned his attention to Sparta and asked menacingly whether he should come as friend or foe. The reply was "''Neither''."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 233e [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html 1] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0198:chapter=69&amp;highlight=neither%2Cphilip 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing patience, he sent the message: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5n4iLuNvHlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0199766495&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikk--Mr6bXAhVJ7GMKHRt2BxEQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=raze&amp;f=false ''The Animal Spirit Doctrine and the Origins of Neurophysiology''], C.U.M. Smith, ''et al., Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Spartan [[ephor]]s again replied with a single word: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If.''&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De garrulitate'', 17 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0288%3Asection%3D17 1] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_garrulitate*.html 2] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20140804211840/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/49190/ 3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Subsequently, neither Philip nor his son [[Alexander the Great]] attempted to capture the city.{{refn|group=note|Sparta then declined to participate in Macedon's [[Wars of Alexander the Great#Persia|invasion of the Persian Empire]], a fact memorialized in a proclamation Alexander sent to Athens with armor captured at the [[Battle of the Granicus]]: [[:wikiquote:Macedonia#Historians|"Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia."]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'', I, 16, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Clear}}

===In humor===
The Spartans were especially famous for their dry, understated wit,&lt;ref name="Stuttard2014"&gt;{{cite book|first= David|last= Stuttard|title=A History of Ancient Greece in Fifty Lives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VAc7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;q=laconic+wit|date=14 October 2014| publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn= 978-0-500-77221-8|page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as "laconic humor". This can be contrasted with the "[[Attic Greek|Attic]] salt" or "Attic wit" {{ndash}} the refined, poignant, delicate humour of Sparta's chief rival, [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="Belfield1897"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry H.|last= Belfield|title= Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son and godson|url=

Various more recent groups also have a reputation for laconic humor: Icelanders in the [[Icelandic Sagas|sagas]],&lt;ref name = "Hallberg1962"&gt;Peter Hallberg, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sq0Ku9yBDJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=laconic_repartee The Icelandic Saga]'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Anglophone world, Australians (''cf.''

==History==
[[File:Chilon of Sparta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chilon of Sparta]]]]
Spartans paid less attention than other [[ancient Greeks]] to the development of [[Education in ancient Greece|education]], [[Ancient Greek art|arts]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Hippias Major]]'' 285b–d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some view this as having contributed to the characteristically blunt Laconian speech. However, [[Socrates]], in [[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']], appears to reject the idea that Spartans' economy with words was simply a consequence of poor literary education: "... they conceal their wisdom, and pretend to be blockheads, so that they may seem to be superior only because of their [[Spartan army|prowess in battle]] ... This is how you may know that I am speaking the truth and that the Spartans are the best educated in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]] and [[rhetoric|speaking]]: if you talk to any ordinary Spartan, he seems to be stupid, but eventually, like an expert marksman, he shoots in some brief remark that proves you to be only a child".&lt;ref&gt;''Protagoras'' 342b, d–e, from the translation given at the end of the section on Lycurgus in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207014704/http://www.e-classics.com/index.html e-classics.com].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|An alternative translation based on those by A. Beresford and R.E. Allen is as follows: "...they claim not to have any interest in [philosophy] and put on this big show of being morons...because...they want people to think that their superiority rests on fighting battles and being manly... You can tell that what I say is true, and that Spartans are the best educated in philosophy and argument, by this: if one associates with the most inferior Spartan, one at first finds him somewhat inferior in speech; but then at some chance point in the discussion he throws in a remark worthy of noticing, brief and terse, like a skilled marksman, so that the person he's talking to appears no better than a child."&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, R.E.|title=The Dialogues of Plato| volume= 3: Ion, Hippias Minor, Laches, and Protagoras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7StRBqCrebwC&amp;pg=203|year=1984|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300074383|pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Socrates was known to have admired Spartan laws,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Crito]]'' 52e.&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Laconophilia#Ancient Laconophilia|many other Athenians]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 544c.&lt;/ref&gt; but modern scholars have doubted the seriousness of his attribution of a secret love of philosophy to Spartans.&lt;ref name = "Taylor1949"&gt;[[A.E. Taylor|Taylor, A.E.]], [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato:  The Man and His Work''], Meridian Books, 6th ed., 1949; on [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;pg=PA255 p. 255] Taylor suggests Socrates is mocking, in jest, other Greeks who affect a Spartan lifestyle as the epitome of rugged manliness for not realizing their models are closet intellectuals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taylor2002"&gt;Taylor, C.C.W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=mXkxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=9780199555659&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+ordinary+Spartan ''Plato: Protagoras''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199555659}}, 2009; pp. 43, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005"&gt;Beresford, A., [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato: Protagoras and Meno''], Penguin Books 2005, p. 151.; see [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers#v=snippet&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers commentary] (click on "61" link).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Spartans [[Myson of Chenae]] and [[Chilon of Sparta]] have traditionally been counted among the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; both were famous for many laconic sayings.{{refn|group=note|Examples include "We should not investigate facts by the light of arguments, but arguments by the light of facts" for Myson,&lt;ref name="laertius"&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iHpVDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Lives of the Eminent Philosophers]''. Translated by Pamela Mensch.

In general, however, Spartans were expected to be men of few words, to hold rhetoric in disdain, and to stick to the point. Loquacity was considered frivolous and unbecoming of sensible, down-to-earth [[Spartiate|Spartan peers]]. A Spartan youth was reportedly liable to have his thumb bitten as punishment for too verbose a response to a teacher's question.&lt;ref name="Cartledge2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Cartledge|title=Spartan Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgFlxZ14hkoC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=2012-12-13|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23124-5|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spartan===
*A [[wit]]ticism attributed to [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], the possibly legendary lawgiver of Sparta, was a response to a proposal to set up a [[democracy]] there: "Begin with your own family."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Lycurgus'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html 1] [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033-h/14033-h.htm#LIFE_OF_LYKURGUS 2] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lycurgus*.html 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
*On another occasion, Lycurgus was reportedly asked the reason for the less-than-extravagant size of Sparta's [[sacrifice]]s to the [[Religion in ancient Greece|gods]]. He replied, "So that we may always have something to offer."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When he was consulted on how Spartans might best forestall invasion of their homeland, Lycurgus advised, "By remaining poor, and each man not desiring to possess more than his fellow."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When asked whether it would be prudent to build a [[defensive wall]] enclosing the city, Lycurgus answered, "A city is well-fortified which has a wall of men instead of brick."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt; (When another Spartan was later shown an Asian city with impressive fortifications, he remarked, "Fine quarters for women!"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 230c.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Responding to a visitor who questioned why they put their fields in the hands of the [[helots]] rather than cultivate them themselves, [[Anaxandridas II|Anaxandridas]] explained, "It was by not taking care of the fields, but of ourselves, that we acquired those fields."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica'' (Sayings of Spartans), 217a. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;
*King [[Demaratus]], being pestered by someone with a question concerning who the most exemplary Spartan was, answered "He that is least like you."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*On her husband [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]]'s departure for battle with the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] at [[Thermopylae]], [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]] asked what she should do. He advised her: "Marry a good man and bear good children."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 225a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lacaenarum Apophthegmata'' (Sayings of Spartan Women), 240e. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical examples===
[[File:Pyrrhus.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]]]
* When [[Ben-Hadad I]], king of [[Aram-Damascus]], attacked [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], he sent a message: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in [[Samaria]] to give each of my men a handful." Ahab replied, "One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off."&lt;ref&gt;[[I Kings]] 20:10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A traveler from [[Sybaris]], a city in southern Italy (which gave rise to the word ''[[:wikt:sybarite|sybarite]]'') infamous in the ancient world for its luxury and gluttony, was invited to eat in a Spartan [[Syssitia|mess hall]] and tasted their [[black broth]]. Disgusted, he remarked, "No wonder Spartans are the bravest of men. Anyone in their right mind would rather die a thousand times than live like this."&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' Book IV, 138d; Book XII, 518e; trans. quoted in [[Andrew Dalby|Dalby, A.]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=qZe4TquzL6qIiAK09KnwBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=wtLgAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=senses+would+rather+die Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy in Greece]''. London: Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|0-415-15657-2}}, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When news of the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] reached Athens in 336&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[strategos]] [[Phocion]] banned all celebratory sacrifice, saying: "The army which defeated us at [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Chaeronea]] has lost just one man."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Phocion|"Phocion"]], 16.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The heavy price of defeating the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[Battle of Asculum (279 BC)]] prompted [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] to respond to an offer of congratulations with "If we win one more battle we will be doomed" ("One more [[Pyrrhic victory|such victory]] and the cause is lost"; in Greek: Ἂν ἔτι μίαν μάχην νικήσωμεν, ἀπολώλαμεν ''Án éti mían máchēn nikḗsōmen, apolṓlamen'').&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Pyrrhus|"Pyrrhus"]], 21.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">A '''loosely associated statement''' is a type of [[simple non-inferential passage]] wherein statements about a general subject are juxtaposed but make no inferential claim.&lt;ref name="Conciselogic"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=17 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[rhetorical device]], loosely associated statements may be intended by the speaker to infer a claim or conclusion, but because they lack a coherent logical structure any such interpretation is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as loosely associated statements prove nothing and attempt no obvious conclusion.&lt;ref name="Logicofarguments"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.julianhermida.com/algoma/law1studyarguments.htm | title=The logic of arguments | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely associated statements can be said to serve no obvious purpose, such as illustration or explanation.&lt;ref name="NONargument"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/polen/LC9_Help/1/12loosely.htm | title=NONargument - Loosely associated statements | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included statements can be premises, conclusions or both, and both true or false, but missing from the passage is a claim that any one statement supports another.

== Examples ==
In ''A concise introduction to logic'', Hurley demonstrates the concept with a quote by [[Lao-Tzu]]:

{{quote |Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind. |Lao-Tzu}}

While each clause in the quote may seem related to the others, each provides no reason to believe another.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Walken - 1984.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Christopher Walken]] performing a monologue in the 1984 stage play ''[[Hurlyburly]]'']]
In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

'''Museolog''' is a web-driven [[software]] system for cataloging museum information. It is an advanced tool for museum records management, based on the international standards. It was developed by EUROCLID within the UNESCO HeritageNet project, and localized by the non-governmental organization, Open Systems. Using this software, initial functions of input and editing of museum catalogues are provided what has been described as "a modern intuitive graphical interface using forms and menus." Museolog is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/museolog/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing museum objects==

Museolog allows the user to create a record across several interactive sessions. It is also possible to save non-validated, incomplete records for future completion.

Access to the database is regulated by a system of managing access rights, to various levels of functionaries in the museum.

It is also possible manage object movements (when an object is moved from one place to another within the museum, or on loan to an external place), and restoration work. To track movement, a 'movement sheet' is printed. This software allows the user to print a list of all objects on loan, including details like origin and destination place.

When restoration work is undertaken, the type of work (e.g. cleaning), the physical method used, and digital photos taken before and after can be recorded.

==Searching the museum==

Searching and selecting records is also possible, from the catalogue, through the use of Boolean queries. Retrieved records are shown as a short-list of titles; clicking on any would show the full record. Selected records are printable, with any relevant images inserted in the document.

In keeping with current methods of photographing museum exhibits, digital images are indexed in the database. These images are archived, using recordable CD-roms. CDs are then numbered and indexed in the database, making retrieval easy of all museum objects.

==More functions==

Users can save the current state of the database on a CD-R; there is the possibility of rebuilding this when needed due to any possible hardware or software crash. Data from the database can also be exported in XML format, making it transferable to other databases or website. This software also allows for managing [[thesauri]] and authority lists. Users can load, browse, edit and export [[thesauri]] and terminology resources, thus allowing for cooperative terminology definition and exchanges.

==Versions available==

As of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556 July 7, 2007] the versions that were available were [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148371 4.5-6 for Linux] and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148372 4.6 for Windows], both released in mid-2005.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2018}}
{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Statement
! Other names
|-
| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}
| Syllables must have no codas.
| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

'''''Pars pro toto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑːr|z|_|p|r|əʊ|_|ˈ|t|əʊ|t|əʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pars_pro_toto|title=pars pro toto {{!}} Definition of pars pro toto in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈpars proː ˈtoː.toː|lang}}), [[Latin]] for "a part (taken) for the whole",&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pars%20pro%20toto |title=pars pro toto - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[figure of speech]] where the name of a ''portion'' of an object, place, or concept represents its ''entirety''. It is distinct from a [[merism]], which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; [[metonymy]], where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or [[synecdoche]], which can refer both to this and its inverse: the whole representing a part.

In the context of language, ''pars pro toto'' means that something is named after a part of it, or after a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole.  For example, "glasses" is a ''pars pro toto'' name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass.
Examples of common ''pars pro toto'' usage in political geography include "[[Russia]]" or "[[Russian people|Russians]]", for the entire former [[Russian Empire]] or former [[Soviet Union]] or its people, [[China]] for [[People's Republic of China]], [[Holland]] for the [[Netherlands]], and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of "[[England]]" in that language for "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]". Among English-speakers "[[Great Britain]]" or "Britain" is a common ''pars pro toto'' shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. [[Switzerland]]'s name (in German ''Schweiz'') comes from its central Canton of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]].

The inverse of a ''pars pro toto'' is a ''[[totum pro parte]]'', in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as widespread use of "[[Americas|America]]" (which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically, with alliteration, alongside Asia, Africa, "Europa", and ultimately [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) in place of "[[United States of America]]", "United States" or "US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Arts Ltd. |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/totum_pro_parte.html |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology (ODLT) s.v. totum pro parte |publisher=ODLT |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[synecdoche]]'' is used for both, as well as similar metaphors, though in Greek it literally means "simultaneous understanding".

'''Philandry''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[men]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Philandry |edition=2nd revised |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philandry |title=Philandry |work=[[WordNet]] |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misandry]]''. Philandry is not to be confused with [[androphilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to men or [[masculinity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[androphobia]]'').

== Etymology ==
''Philandry'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''andro'' (man). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to women (females) are [[philogyny]] for "fondness towards women" and [[misogyny]] for "hatred of women". Parallel terms for humanity in general are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C.

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SummaryDiagramVertical.png|frame|right|The transition of [[communication technology]]: [[oral culture]], [[manuscript culture]], print culture, and [[Information Age]]]]
'''Print culture''' embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of [[visual communication]]. One prominent scholar in the field is [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], who contrasted print culture, which appeared in Europe in the centuries after the advent of the Western [[printing-press]] (and much earlier in China where [[woodblock printing]] was used from 594 AD), to ''scribal culture''. [[Walter Ong]], by contrast, has contrasted written culture, including scribal, to [[oral culture]]. Ong is generally considered one of the first scholars to define print culture in contrast to [[oral culture]].  These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture.  The development of [[printing]], like the development of [[writing]] itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation.

In terms of image-based communication, a similar transformation came in Europe from the fifteenth century on with the introduction of the [[old master print]] and, slightly later, [[popular prints]], both of which were actually much quicker in reaching the mass of the population than printed text.

Print culture is the conglomeration of effects on human society that is created by making printed forms of communication. Print culture encompasses many stages as it has evolved in response to technological advances. Print culture can first be studied from the period of time involving the gradual movement from oration to script as it is the basis for print culture. As the printing became commonplace, script became insufficient and printed documents were [[mass production|mass-produced]]. The era of physical print has had a lasting effect on human culture, but with the advent of digital text, some scholars believe the printed word is becoming obsolete.

The [[electronic media]], including the [[World Wide Web]], can be seen as an outgrowth of print culture.

== The development of print ==

===Prior to print===
[[Oral culture]] was all that existed. Oral culture gradually found the need to store what was said for long periods of time, and slowly developed scribal culture. Scribal culture being inaccurate and tedious at best developed into print culture. Each segment is rich with its own effects on the world. Scribal culture, defined by the written or physical conveying of ideas, is important to understand in achieving a grasp on the unfolding of print culture itself. Scholars disagree over when scribal culture developed. [[Walter Ong]] argues that scribal culture cannot exist until an alphabet is created, and a form of writing standardized. On the other hand, [[D. F. McKenzie]] argues that even communicative notches on a stick, or structure, represent “text”, and therefore scribal culture.

Ong suggests scribal culture is defined by an alphabet. McKenzie says that the key to scribal culture is non-verbal communication, which can be accomplished in more ways than using an alphabet. These two views give rise to the importance of print culture. In scribal culture, procuring documents was a difficult task, and documentation would then be limited to the rich only. Ideas are difficult to spread amongst large groups of people over large distances of land, not allowing for effective dissemination of knowledge.

Scribal culture also deals with large levels of inconsistency. It was always considered that the oldest document was the most accurate, as it had been copied the least. In the process of copying documents, many times the meaning became changed, and the words different. Reliance on the written text of the time was never exceedingly strong. Over time, a greater need for reliable, quickly reproduced, and a relatively inexpensive means of distributing written text arose. Scribal culture, transforming into print culture, was only replicated in manners of written text.

===Development of print===
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]] 
The Chinese invention of [[paper]] and [[woodblock printing]], at some point before the first dated [[book]] in 868 (the [[Diamond Sutra]]) produced the world's first print culture.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1-4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of [[books]], on subjects ranging from [[Confucian|Confusion Classics]] to [[science]] and [[mathematics]], were printed using [[woodblock printing]].

[[Paper]] and [[woodblock printing]] were introduced into Europe in the 15th Century, and the first printed [[book]]s began appearing in Europe. Chinese movable type was spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing which was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; East metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Polenz, Peter von. |title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

S. Stavrianos]] |title=A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century |edition=7th |year=1998 |origyear=1970 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-923897-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]] (circa 1450) greatly reduced the amount of labor required to produce a book leading to a tremendous increase in the number of books produced. Early printers tried to keep their printed copies of a text as faithful as possible to the original manuscript. Even so, the earliest publications were still often different from the original, for a short time, in some ways [[manuscript]]s still remaining more accurate than printed books.

Hand-copied illustrations were replaced by first [[woodcut]]s, later [[engraving]]s that could be duplicated precisely, revolutionizing technical literature (Eisenstein 155).

== Print culture, the Renaissance, and the Reformation ==
Eisenstein has described how the high costs of copying scribal works often led to their abandonment and eventual destruction.  Furthermore, the cost and time of copying led to the slow propagation of ideas. In contrast, the printing press allowed rapid propagation of ideas, resulting in knowledge and cultural movements that were far harder to destroy.

Eisenstein points to prior renaissances (rebirths) of classical learning prior to the printing press that failed.  In contrast, the Renaissance was a permanent revival of classical learning because the printing of classical works put them into a permanent and widely read form.

Similarly, Eisenstein points to a large number of prior attempts in Western Europe to assert doctrines contrary to the ruling Catholic Church.  In contrast, the [[Protestant Reformation]] spread rapidly and permanently due to the printing of non-conformist works such as the [[95 Theses]].

===Renaissance===
With the shift towards printing presses in the West, after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a method that was cheap, fast, and filling the demand for books, the Renaissance truly came into its own.  Even though the printing press was a paradigm shifting invention, printing had many critics, who were afraid that books could spread lies and subversion or corrupt unsuspecting readers.  Also, they were afraid that the printed texts would spread heresy and sow religious discord.  The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book produced with moveable type in Europe.  Martin Luther's Bible, which was published in German in 1522, started the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Latin's importance as a language started languishing with the rise of texts written in national languages.  The shift from scholarly Latin to everyday languages marked an important turning point in print culture.  The vernacular Bibles were important to other nations, as well.  The [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] Authorized Version was published in 1611, for example.  Along with the religious tracts, the scientific revolution was largely due to the printing press and the new print culture.  Scholarly books were more accessible, and the printing press provided more accurate diagrams and symbols.  Along with scientific texts, like the works of [[Copernicus]],  [[Galileo]], and [[Tycho Brahe]], atlases and cartography started taking off within the new print culture, mostly due to the exploration of different nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
With the rise of literacy, books and other texts became more entrenched in the culture of the West.  Along with literacy and more printed words also came censorship, especially from governments.  In France, [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] were both imprisoned for their works.  Other authors, like [[Montesquieu]] and [[Diderot]], had to publish outside France.  Censored books became a valuable commodity within this environment, and an underground network of book smugglers started operating within France.  Diderot and Jean d'Alembert created the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', which was published in 1751 in seventeen folio volumes with eleven volumes of engravings.  This work embodied the essence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print culture and the American Revolution==

===A profound impact===
Numerous eras throughout history have been defined through the use of print culture. The [[American Revolution]] was a major historical conflict fought after print culture brought the rise of literacy. Furthermore, print culture's ability to shape and guide society was a critical component before, during, and after the Revolution.

===Pre-Revolution===
Many different printed documents influenced the beginning of the revolution. The [[Magna Carta]] was originally a scribal document of 1215, recording an oral transaction restricting the power of English kings and defining rights of subjects. It was revitalized by being printed in the 16th century and widely read by the increasingly literate English and colonial population thereafter.  The Magna Carta was used as a basis for the development of English liberties by [[Sir Edward Coke]] and became a basis for writing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Additionally, during the 18th century, the production of printed newspapers in the colonies greatly increased. In 1775, more copies of newspapers were issued in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] than were printed in all of New England in 1754, showing that the existence of the conflict developed a need for print culture. This onslaught of printed text was brought about by the anonymous writings of men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was noted for his many contributions to the newspapers, including the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]]. This increase was primarily due to the easing of the government's tight control of the press, and without the existence of a relatively free press, the American Revolution may have never taken place. The production of so many newspapers can mostly be attributed to the fact that newspapers had a huge demand; printing presses were writing the newspapers to complain about the policies of the British government, and how the British government was taking advantage of the colonists.

In 1775, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote the pamphlet "[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]," a pamphlet that introduced many ideas of freedom to the Colonial citizens. Allegedly, half a million copies were produced during the pre-revolution era. This number of pamphlets produced is significant as there were only a few million freed men in the colonies. However, "Common Sense" was not the only manuscript that influenced people and the tide of the revolution. Among the most influential were [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]]' "Rights of the British Colonies" and  [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]'s "Farmer's Letters". Both of these played a key role in persuading the people and igniting the revolution.

===During the Revolution===
Newspapers were printed during the revolution covering battle reports and propaganda. These reports were usually falsified by Washington in order to keep morale up among American citizens and troops. Washington was not the only one to falsify these reports, as other generals (on both sides) used this technique as well. The newspapers also covered some of the battles in great detail, especially the ones that the American forces won, in order to gain support from other countries in hopes that they would join the American forces in the fight against the British.

Before the Revolution, the British placed multiple acts upon the colonies, such as the [[stamp act]]. Many newspaper companies worried that the British would punish them for printing papers without a British seal, so they were forced to temporarily discontinue their work or simply change the title of their paper. However, some patriotic publishers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration of their title.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is a very important written document that was drafted by the original thirteen colonies, as a form of print culture that would declare their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained the justifications for doing so.  While it was explicitly documented on July 4, 1776, it was not recognized by [[Great Britain]] until September 3, 1783, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

===Post-Revolution===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], a cluster of free states in need of a government was created. The basis for this government was known as the [[Articles of Confederation]], which were put to effect in 1778 and formed the first governing document of the United States of America. This document, however, was found to be unsuitable to outline the structure of the government, and thus showed an ineffectual use of print culture, and since printed texts were the most respected documents of the time, this called for an alteration in the document used to govern the confederation.

It was the job of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to reform the document, but they soon discovered that an entirely new text was needed in its place. The result was the [[United States Constitution]]. In the form of written word, the new document was used to grant more power to the central government, by expanding into branches. After it was ratified by all of the states in the union, the Constitution served as a redefinition of the modern government.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was noted as saying, “The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” This serves as an excellent example of how newspapers were highly regarded by the colonial people. In fact, much like other forms of 18th century print culture, newspapers played a very important role in the government following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Not only were they one of the few methods in the 18th century to voice the opinion of the people, they also allowed for the ideas to be disseminated to a wide audience, a primary goal of printed text. A famous example of the newspaper being used as a medium to convey ideas were the [[Federalist Papers]]. These were first published in New York City newspapers in 1788 and pushed for people to accept the idea of the United States Constitution by enumerating 85 different articles that justified its presence, adding to a series of texts designed to reinforce each other, and ultimately serving as a redefinition of the 18th century.

== The state of print today ==
Today, print has matured to a state where the majority of modern society has come to have certain expectations regarding the printed book:
* The knowledge contained by printed books is believed to be accurate.
* The cited author of a printed book does indeed exist and is actually the person who wrote it.
* Every copy of a printed book is identical (at least in the important aspects) to every other copy, no matter how far apart the locations are in which they are sold.

Copyright laws help to protect these standards. However, a few regions do exist in the world where literary [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] has become a standard commercial practice. In such regions, the preceding expectations are not the norm. (Johns 61)

Currently, there are still approximately 2.3 billion books still sold each year worldwide. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to the ever-growing popularity of the [[Internet]] and other forms of digital media.

== Transition to the digital era ==
As David J. Gunkel states in his article "What's the Matter with Books?", society is currently in the late age of the text; the moment of transition from print to electronic culture where it is too late for printed books and yet too early for electronic texts. Jay David Bolter, author of ''Writing Space'', also discusses our culture in what he calls "the late age of print."  The current debate going on in the literary world is whether or not the computer will replace the printed book as the repository and definition of human knowledge. There is still a very large audience committed to printed texts, who are not interested in moving to a digital representation of the repository for human knowledge. Bolter, in his own scholarship and also along with Richard Grusin in ''Remediation'', explains that despite current fears about the end of print, the format will never be erased but only remediated.  New forms of technology (new media) will be created which utilize features of old media, thus preventing old media's (aka print's) erasure.  At the same time, there are also concerns over whether obsolescence and deterioration make digital media unsuitable for long-term archival purposes. Much of the early paper used for print is highly acidic, and will ultimately destroy itself.

The way that information is transferred has also changed with this new age of digital text and the shift towards electronic media. Gunkel states that information now takes the form of immaterial bits of digital data that are circulated at the speed of light. Consequently, what the printed book states about the exciting new culture and economy of bits is abraded by the fact that this information has been delivered in the slow and outdated form of physical paper.

In the article, [http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Eeleclaw/ylj5.html "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment"], the author notes that expectations will change as information becomes less tied to specific locations, and as machines become networked and linked to other machines. This means that in the future certain goods will not be associated with their origins.

The article "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192001/http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~eleclaw/ylj4.html]) also mentions how the new electronic age will make print better. Placing information into electronic form not only liberates the information from its pages but removes the need for specialized spaces to hold particular kinds of information. People have become increasingly accustomed to acquiring information from our homes that used to be only accessible from an office or library. Once computers are all [[computer networking|networked]], all information should, at least in theory, be accessible from all places. Print itself contained a set of invisible and inherent censors, which [[electronic media]] is helping to remove from the creation of text. Points of control that are present in print space are no longer present as distribution channels multiply, as copying becomes faster and cheaper, as more information is produced, as economic incentives for working with information increase, and as barriers and boundaries that inhibited working with information are crossed.

== Changes in technology and its effect on print culture ==
There are more online publications, [[Academic journal|journals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and businesses than ever before. While this brings society closer, and makes publications more convenient and accessible, ordering a product online reduces contact with others. Many online articles are anonymous, making the '[[death of the author]]' even more apparent. Anyone can post articles and journals online anonymously. In effect, the individual becomes separated from the rest of society.

The advances of technology in print culture can be separated into three shifts: 
*spoken language to the written word, 
*the written word to Printing press, 
*the printing press to the computer/internet.

The written word has made history recordable and accurate.  The printing press, some may argue, is not a part of print culture, but had a substantial impact upon the development of print culture through the times. The printing press brought uniform copies and efficiency in print. It allowed a person to make a living from writing. Most importantly, it spread print throughout society.

The advances made by technology in print also impact anyone using cell phones, laptops, and personal digital organizers. From novels being delivered via a cell phone, the ability to text message and send letters via e-mail clients, to having entire libraries stored on PDAs, print is being influenced by devices.

== Non-textual forms of print culture ==

Symbols, logos and printed images are forms of printed media that do not rely on text. They are ubiquitous in modern urban life. Analyzing these cultural products is an important part of the field of [[cultural studies]].  Print has given rise to a wider distribution of pictures in society in conjunction with the printed word.  Incorporation of printed pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books gave printed material a wider mass appeal through the ease of [[visual culture|visual communication]].

== Text and Print ==

There is a common miscommunication that occurs when discussing that which is
print and that which is text. In the literary world, notable scholars such as
[[Walter Ong]] and [[D.F. McKenzie]] have disagreed on the meaning of text. The
point of the discussion at hand is to have a word that encompasses all forms
of communication - that which is printed, that which is online media, even a
building or notches on a stick.  According to Walter Ong text did not come
about until the development of the first alphabet, well after humanity existed.
According to Mckenzie primitive humans did have a form of text they used to
communicate with their cave drawings.  This is discussed in [[literary theory]]. Print, however, is a representation of that which is printed, and
does not encompass all forms of communication (e.g. a riot at a football game).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">In certain theories of [[syntax]], an '''R-expression''' (short for ''referring expression'') is a category in the three-way classification of [[noun phrases]] in binding theory, the other two being [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphors]] and [[pronominal]]s. According to [[principle C]] of binding theory, R-expressions must be free. R-expressions include names (e.g. Mary, John) and definite DPs (e.g. the cat).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Crystal]]; A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chomsky]]'s [[government and binding theory]], an R-expression is an overt NP analysed as [-a. -p] (not anaphor and not pronominal), and hence subject only to Principle C of the Binding Theory, namely, that it be free (unbound) in all domains. Examples of typical R-expressions are "Lisa", "the dog", "my pet unicorn", "the last chapter of the book", and "Janel's cigarettes". The name is derived from the phrase ''[[referring expression]]'', used in semantics for the largest class of NPs, but the GB usage is not synonymous with the semantic sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. L.

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==

[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory
Right Hand Drive Vehicles For Postal Carriers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===

[[Image:roberto busa e index thomisticus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Vicenza]], the second of five children, he attended primary school in [[Bolzano]] and grammar school in [[Verona]] and in [[Belluno]]. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope John Paul I]]. In 1933 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled "The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of [[Ontology]], [[Theodicy]] and [[Scientific methodology|Scientific Methodology]] and, for some years, a librarian in the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy of [[Gallarate]].

==The ''Index Thomisticus''==
In 1946 he planned the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with [[Thomas J. Watson]], the founder of [[IBM]], and was able to persuade him to sponsor the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the ''Index Thomisticus''. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age web-based version] made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the [http://itreebank.marginalia.it ''Index Thomisticus'' Treebank] project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.

==The Busa Prize==
The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) awards the "Busa Prize", which honors leaders in the field of [[digital humanities|humanities computing]]. The
first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include:

      <comment>There was absolutely a rigidly enforced division. Women in ancient Greece rarely held public or political roles. One exception may be Aspasia of Miletus, who was a courtesan. Otherwise, most wives and daughters were largely confined to a secluded portion of the household known as the Gynaeceum.</comment>

Terms such as '''separate spheres''' and '''domestic–public dichotomy''' refer to a [[social phenomenon]], within [[modern society|modern societies]] that feature, to some degree, an [[empirical]] separation between a [[private sphere|domestic or private sphere]] and a [[Public sphere|public or social sphere]]. This observation may be  controversial, and is often also seen as supporting [[Patriarchy|patriarchal ideologies]] that seek to ''create or strengthen'', any such separation between spheres, and to confine women to the domestic/private sphere.

The patriarchal ideology of separate spheres, based primarily on notions of [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|biologically determined gender roles]]  and/or patriarchal religious doctrine, claims that women should avoid the public sphere &amp;ndash; the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and law. Women's "proper sphere", according to the ideology, is the realm of domestic life, focused on childcare, housekeeping, and religion.&lt;ref name="kuersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ryle |first1= Robyn |title= Questioning gender: a sociological exploration |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CHHz_p-j9hMC&amp;pg=PA342 |edition= |year= 2012 |publisher= SAGE/Pine Forge Press |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-6594-1 |pages= 342&amp;ndash;43|chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observable phenomena, however, the existence of separate spheres is much older.

==History==
The idea that women should inhabit a separate domestic sphere has been extant in [[Western thought]] for centuries, extending as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery | last2= |first2= |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

The modern ideology of separate spheres emerged in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory|last1=Wells|first1=Christopher|publisher=[[Routledge]]|others=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99802-4|editor1-last=Kowaleski-Wallace|editor1-first=Elizabeth|editor1-link=|location=London, New York|page=519|language=|chapter=Separate Spheres|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=blI0_52wIwYC&amp;pg=PA519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the industrialization of the Western world, family members worked side by side and the workplace was located mostly in and around the home. With the shift from home-based to factory production, men left the home to sell their labor for wages while women stayed home to perform unpaid domestic work. The separate spheres ideology reflected and fueled these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise encyclopedia of sociology|last1=Adams|first1=Michele|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|editor1-last=Ritzer|editor1-first=George|editor1-link=|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.; Malden, MA|pages=156&amp;ndash;57|chapter=Divisions of household labor|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=J.

Feminist writers like Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lucy Stone demanded political equality for women as well as men and provided searing criticisms of the "separate sphere" ideals that confined women exclusively to the domestic sphere. Theorists such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] have argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the [[means of production]] and consequently became a private, separate sphere. As a result, Engels contended, women were excluded from participating directly in the production process and relegated to the subordinate domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to 19th-Century America|last1=Edwards|first1=Laura F.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-20985-0|editor1-last=Barney|editor1-first=William L.|editor1-link=|location=Malden, MA|pages=225&amp;ndash;226|chapter=Gender and the Changing Roles of Women|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=elgGfYla0hwC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major commentator on the modern idea of "separate spheres" was the French political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="kerber1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kerber |first1= Linda K. | authorlink1 = Linda K.

[[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any "intrinsic" predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [[Cult of Domesticity|"Cult of True Womanhood"]], an ideal of [[femininity]] prevalent among the [[Upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es in the 19th century. "True women" were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Welter |first1= Barbara |authorlink1=  |last2=  |first2=  |year= 1966 |title= The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820–1860 |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–174 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi= 10.2307/2711179 |url= https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |accessdate=  |jstor= 2711179 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113000/https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |archivedate= 2011-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of the separate spheres ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt;

In [[Woman, Culture, and Society]] (1974), [[Michelle Rosaldo]] emphasizes the idea that these separate spheres can be explained in terms of a dichotomy, in the sense that these gender-oriented domains are viewed as so totally separate that it only reinforces the ideology of gender separation and inequality. Activities given to men, versus those assigned to women, were seen as having more value and contributing greatly to the society. Adversely, the woman's so-called simpler roles of housework and childrearing were held at a much lesser value. Rosaldo argues a "universal asymmetry" between the sexes that primarily caused these separations to arise. This model mainly focuses on the generational subordination of women in relation to men throughout history and across different cultures, defining the domestic and public spheres in very black and white terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:00972854|title=Woman, culture, and society|last=Rosaldo|first=Michelle Zimbalist|last2=Lamphere|first2=Louise|last3=Bamberger|first3=Joan|date=1974|isbn=0804708509|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier model, however, has since been challenged by researchers in the field, claiming the spheres cannot be outlined in such simplistic terms. Woman, Culture, and Society&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gender-in-cross-cultural-perspective/oclc/951536398?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F|date=2016|isbn=9780205247288|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-editor Louis Lamphere breaks down Rosaldo's model and discusses the spheres in different terms. Lamphere primarily dispels the concept of "universal asymmetry", looking toward various societies worldwide for proof. Even in some Middle Eastern cultures that place women in extreme positions of subordination, the model could not be so easily applied. This is because the domestic and public spheres are almost always overlapping in some way, regardless of a cultural female subservience or even egalitarianism. Women enter public spaces in order to fulfill certain duties that fall within their domestic responsibilities. Men must return to the private, or domestic, space eventually to bring home the spoils of his labor in the public sphere. In this sense, there are two separate spheres created and enforced by gender ideologies; but they are not dichotomous. They, instead, form an integrated system of life in society, varying only in levels of intensities from culture to culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to Cary Franklin, the women’s rights movements in the mid-1960s proposed that to achieve true equality between the sexes, it is necessary for the laws to be put in place to move past the simple separate spheres model and address the “interspherical impacts”. In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) pushed for equality of women in society and in the workplace and in order to attain this equality, there would have to be changes in family regulation. NOW stressed the importance of focusing on structurally altering the family sphere in order to then create gender equality in the education and workplace spheres. The family sphere is acting as a catalyst seeing that without a change in it, women would simply lack access to the opportunities that men already have available to them. Franklin also pointed out that the gender inequality among the American population in the 60’s and 70’s was a major contributor to the civil rights statutes of the Second Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/global/article/GALE%7CA376853033/165d132476e2721e8ea83c8ef676695a?u=txshracd2548|title=Redirect Page|website=bi.galegroup.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotman|first=DeborahL.|date=2006|title=Separate Spheres?: Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity|jstor=506286|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=666–674|doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Rotman, an anthropologist at Notre Dame, analyzed this concept of separate spheres specifically among the people of Deerfield, Massachusetts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In this community, there was a clear divide between men and women by means of a “proper allocation” in which females were given the domestic residence or sphere and the men were given the “economically productive agricultural land”. Men would migrate away from the women if agriculture was depleting in their given agricultural space. As the men were moving to work outside the home, women began to acclimate to the economic atmosphere and gain more opportunities in the public sphere with all the men working elsewhere. These women soon had various roles in the public and private spheres in Deerfield. As equal rights began to become part of the ideological framework in Deerfield, women found themselves voting in school boards, working on municipal water projects and working in fundraisers as men had done before them. Despite the traditional understanding of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of completely separate public and private spheres, the Deerfield community challenged these “dichotomies of domesticity” and paved the way for equal rights for men and women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The separation between female and male spheres was heavily influenced by [[biological determinism]],&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Roy |first1= Anupama |title= Gendered citizenship: historical and conceptual explorations |chapter = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko4sVA2JRJUC&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orient Longman]] |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-250-2797-3| page= 80&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grana |first1= Sheryl J. |title= Women and justice |chapter = 'Nature' and Biology | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5IKdJLjtbtoC&amp;pg=PA20 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-7002-3| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion that women and men are naturally suitable for different social roles due to their biological and genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= Jodi |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of gender and society |volume= 2 | year= 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= Los Angeles |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 586, 602&amp;ndash;603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of biological determinism was popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and among such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argued that women were inherently different from men and should devote themselves to [[reproduction]] and domesticity.&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt; Women were considered passive, dependent on men, and, due to their reproductive capacity, ill-suited for life outside the domestic realm.&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Adams |first1= Michele | last2 = Coltrane | first2 = Scott | editor1-first= Michael S. |editor1-last= Kimmel |editor1-link= Michael Kimmel |editor2-first= Jeff | editor2-last= Hearn | editor3-last = Connell | editor3-first = Raewyn |title= Handbook of studies on men and masculinities |chapter = The Cultural Ideal of Separate Spheres| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UvAZD45BMDoC&amp;pg=PA231 |year= 2005 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London |isbn= 978-0-7619-2369-5| pages= 231&amp;ndash;32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau described women's primary duties in ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', stating that "women's entire education should be planned in relation to men. To please men, to be useful to them, to win their love and respect, to raise them as children, to care for them as adults, correct and console them, make their lives sweet and pleasant; these are women's duties in all ages and these are what they should be taught from childhood."&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt;

The popular beliefs about inherent sex differences remained deeply embedded in popular consciousness throughout the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beyond separate spheres: intellectual roots of modern feminism |last= Rosenberg |first= Rosalind |authorlink= Rosalind Rosenberg |coauthors= |year= 1982 |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |location= New Haven |isbn= 978-0-300-02695-5 |pages= 114, 207, 245&amp;ndash;46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DpZ0Yzs_Cj8C&amp;pg=PA114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, however, [[dissident]] [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and other [[Social science|social scientists]] began to challenge the biological determination of human behavior, revealing great similarities between men and women and suggesting that many sex differences were socially constructed.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt; Despite these new insights and social and economic changes such as women's entry into the labor force, the separate spheres ideology did not disappear.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt;

Similarly, [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] supported the separate spheres ideology and opposed women's suffrage as well as other attempts to broaden women's influence in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter= Conservative Protestantism and the Separate Spheres | title= Ungodly women: gender and the first wave of American fundamentalism |last= DeBerg |first= Betty A.|year= 1990 |publisher= [[Augsburg Fortress]] |location= Minneapolis |isbn= 978-0-8006-2439-2 |pages= 43&amp;ndash;58 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkRgooQLV0C&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological conservatism has been found to have a stable effect on the endorsement of separate spheres ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bartkowski |first1= John P. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Xiaohe | editor1-first= Christopher G. |editor1-last= Ellison |editor1-link=  |editor2-first= Robert A. | editor2-last= Hummer |title= Religion, families, and health: population-based research in the United States |chapter = Religion and Family Values Reconsidered: Gender Traditionalism among Conservative Protestants | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5rvZ4hnClO8C&amp;pg=PA106 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]] |location= New Brunswick, N.J. |isbn= 978-0-8135-4945-3| pages= 106&amp;ndash;125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] propagated a view of womanhood which reinforced gendered division.&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Cathy | authorlink1 = | last2= |first2= |year= 2006 |title= Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions? |journal= [[Transformation (journal)|Transformation]] |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 228&amp;ndash;35|publisher= SAGE Publications |doi= 10.1177/026537880602300406 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gisborne]]'s ''An Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex'' (1797) and [[Henry Venn (Clapham Sect)|Henry Venn]]'s ''The Complete Duty of Man'' (1763) were two popular evangelical texts which described proper behavior for men and women, arguing that a woman's primary duty was to care for those in her domestic circle and obey her husband.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

==Effects==
In her paper "Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions", Cathy Ross suggests that the separate spheres ideology had ambiguous effects on women's lives.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt; She argues that while it "was clear that women were supposed to be subordinate and that home and children were their sphere", the separation of spheres enabled women "to reach out to other women in sisterhood, in solidarity, on the common ground of domesticity".&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

The ideology of separate spheres contributed to resistance to [[coeducation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]|location=New York|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the emergence of gendered educational institutions such as the [[female seminary]] and [[women's college]] in [[higher education]], and the [[woman's club]] in [[continuing education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's club movement|first=Christine|last=Woyshner|page=477|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[teaching]] as a woman's profession was also closely linked to the ideology of separate spheres, as women came to be regarded as uniquely skilled at [[classroom management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|pages=48, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coeducational universities in the late 19th century, the separation of spheres contributed to the emergence of [[home economics]] as a field of advanced study for the woman's sphere,&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; and the [[dean of women]] as frequently the only high-ranking woman administrator in coeducational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=How Deans of Women Became Men | first=Robert Arthur  | last=Schwartz | journal=[[The Review of Higher Education]] | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=1997 | doi=10.1353/rhe.1997.0011 | page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it created a space for women's academic and professional advancement, the separation of spheres also provided an excuse for keeping women out of fields not specifically marked as female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Tolley | first= Kim | title= The Science Education of American Girls | year= 2003 | isbn=978-0-415-93472-5 | publisher= RoutledgeFalmer |location= New York| page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many talented woman scientists were pushed into professorships in home economics rather than in their principal fields.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Melissa|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8|chapter=Home Economics|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women educators resisted this typecasting even while working within the framework of separation. [[Frances Shimer]], founder of [[Shimer College]], which was a woman's school from 1866 to 1950, insisted that she was "in favor of the co-education of the sexes" and that the education at her school was equal to what was given to young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='My whole ambition has ever been to do something smart': Frances Wood Shimer, Cinderella Gregory, and the 1853 Founding of Shimer College|first=Doris |last=Malkmus|journal=Journal of Illinois History|volume=6|issue=3|pages=212&amp;ndash;213|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Commentary ==
A recent study by Jacqueline Henke explores the history of the separate spheres model in America. Henke points out that between 1820 and 1860 (a period sometimes called the dawn of separate spheres) three parenting models were common for two-parent, mother/father families:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Parenting duties are wholly the responsibility of mothers
&lt;br&gt;
2. Parenting duties are separated into fatherly responsibilities and motherly responsibilities
&lt;br&gt;
3. Parenting duties are shared equally among mothers and fathers.
&lt;br&gt;
According to Henke, many parenting books from this era suggested that mothers should take primary responsibility for their children. Yet, some parenting books argued that mothers and fathers should have separate childrearing duties or a completely equal distribution of childrearing responsibilities. Henke argues that, even during the height of domestic ideology and the dawn of separate spheres, parenting advice was not monolithic. Furthermore, the lived realities parents and families during this era were more diverse than the ideals of parenting books.

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''skomorokh''' (скоморох in [[Russian language|Russian]], скоморохъ in [[Old East Slavic]], скоморaхъ in [[Church Slavonic]]) was a [[medieval]] East Slavic [[harlequin]], or actor, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for oral/musical and dramatic performances. The [[etymology]] of the word is not completely clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&amp;morpho=1&amp;basename=%5Cusr%5Clocal%5Cshare%5Cstarling%5Cmorpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;text_word=%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85&amp;method_word=substring Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary entry for skomorokh]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] σκώμμαρχος (cf. σκῶμμα, "joke"); from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaramuccia'' ("joker", cf. [[English language|English]] ''[[scaramouch]]''); from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''masẋara''; and many others.

The skomorokhs appeared in [[Kievan Rus]] no later than the mid-11th century, but [[fresco]] depictions of skomorokh musicians in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] date to the 11th century.

The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' on skomorokhs concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced them as devil servants. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church often railed against them and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God or being downright diabolical. For example [[Theodosius of Kiev]], one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the 11th century, called the skomorokhs "evils to be shunned by good Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Feodosii Pecherskii, ''Sochinenia'', I. I. (Izmail Ivanovich) Sreznevksii, ed., in ''Ucheniia zapiski vtorogo otdelenie Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk'', Vol. 2, no. 2, (St. Petersburg: Tipografii Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, 1856), 195; See Russell Zguta, "Skomorokhi: The Russian Minstrel-Entertainers", ''Slavic Review'' 31 No. 2 (June 1972), 297&amp;ndash;298; Idem, ''Russian Minstrels: A History of the Skomorokhi'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups, who considered them not just useless but even ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy.

They were persecuted in the years of the [[Mongol yoke]], when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. Its art reached its peak in the 15th to the 17th centuries. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches, called ''glumy'' (глумы), performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of [[domra]], [[balalaika]], [[gudok]], [[bagpipes]] or [[buben]] (a kind of [[tambourine]]). The appearance of [[Russian puppet theatre]] was directly associated with skomorokh performances.

Skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares, engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually, the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun-loving saucy ''[[muzhik]]'' (мужик) of comic simplicity. In the 16 and 17th centuries, skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a ''vataga'' (ватага, big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and civilian authorities. 

In 1648 and 1657, [[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei Mikhailovich]] issued [[ukase]]s banning skomorokh art as blasphemous, but actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century, skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|balagans|ru|3=Балаган}}'' (балаган) and ''[[rayok]]s'' (раёк).

In [[anthropology]], '''privilege''' is a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/privilege | title=Privilege &amp;#124; Definition of privilege in English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], privilege is the [[perceived]] rights or advantages that are assumed to be available only to a particular person or group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Lucal, B., 1996.

Teaching Sociology, pp.245-255.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1318739?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in the context of [[social inequality]], particularly in regard to [[ageism|age]], [[disability]], [[Race (human classification)|ethnic or racial category]], [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], and [[social class]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Geographies of Privilege |last = Twine |first = France Winddance |publisher = Routledge |year = 2013 |isbn = 978-0415519618 |location = |pages = 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common examples involve having access to a higher education and housing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under a newer usage of the term, privilege can also be emotional or psychological, regarding comfort and personal self-confidence, or having a sense of belonging or worth in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Privilege: A Reader |last = Kimmel |first = Michael S. |publisher = Westview Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0813344263 |location = |pages = 1, 5, 13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as an academic concept, but has since been invoked more widely, outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/05/check-your-privilege-means |title= Check your privilege!

== History ==
[[File:Du Bois, W. E. B..jpg|thumb|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], author of the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]].'']]
The concept of privilege dates back to 1903 when American [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] published the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', in which he wrote that although [[African American]]s were observant about [[white Americans]] and conscious of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination]], white Americans did not think much about African Americans, nor about the effects of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0253218483|location = |pages = 121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = W.E.B.

In 1988, American [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-racism activist [[Peggy McIntosh]] published the essay ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences through Work in Women’s Studies'', in which she documented forty-six privileges which she, as a white person, experienced in the United States. For example: "I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me", and "I do not have to educate my children to be aware of [[systemic racism]] for their own daily physical protection". McIntosh described [[white privilege]] as an "invisible package of unearned assets" which white people do not want to acknowledge, and which leads to them being confident, comfortable, and oblivious about racial issues, while non-white people become unconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McIntosh's essay has been credited for stimulating academic interest in privilege, which has been extensively studied in the decades since.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last = O'Brien|first = Jodi A.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1412909167|location = |pages = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Princeton University]] first-year student Tal Fortgang wrote ''Checking My Privilege'', a widely debated article in which he condemned classmates who told him to "check his privilege" for attributing his success in life to "some invisible patron saint of white maleness", and "for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theprincetontory.com/main/checking-my-privilege-character-as-the-basis-of-privilege/|title=Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege|last=Fortgang|first=Tal|date=2 April 2014|work=The Princeton Tory|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh afterwards told the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systemically. She argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|title=The Origins of Privilege|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|date=13 May 2014|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as [[racism|race]], [[ageism|age]], [[genderism|gender]], [[heteronormativity|sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[citizenship]], [[religion]], [[physical ability]], health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Plural and Changing Identities: Beyond Identification|last = Casella|first = Eleanor C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|isbn = 9780306486944|location = |pages = 217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNhM_dsYIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Experiences|last = Garnets|first = Linda|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0231124133|location = |pages = 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a white [[lesbian]] [[Professor|university professor]] benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in the Therapy Hour: Voices of Female Clinicians Working with Men (The Routledge Series on Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men)|last = Sweet|first = Holly Barlow|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415885515|location = |pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.

In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|last = Sorrells|first = Kathryn|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1412927444|location = |pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness of privilege ==
Some academics{{such as|date=October 2018}} highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Racial-Cultural Psychology and Counseling, Training and Practice|last = Carter|first = Robert T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0471386292|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes the state of having privilege as being "like running with the wind at your back", unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege.  One writer{{who|date=October 2018}} has referred to such denial as a form of "[[microaggression]]" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last = Sue|first = Derald Wing|publisher = Wiley|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0470491409|location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege, and instead look for ways to justify or minimize the effects of privilege stating that their privilege was fully earned. They justify this by acknowledging the acts of individuals of unearned dominance, but deny that privilege is institutionalized as well as embedded throughout our society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to researchers{{who|date=October 2018}}, privileged individuals resist acknowledging their privileges because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts. Instead it was partly due to a system that has developed to support them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a [[meritocracy]], which researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a [[Meritocracy#Criticism|myth]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Privilege: Teaching and Learning as Allies in the Classroom|last = Case|first = Kim|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415641463|location = |pages =63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School (Princeton Studies in Cultural Sociology)|last = Khan|first = Shamus Rahman|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0691156231|location = |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda Kaye|publisher = SAGE Publications|location = |pages = 471 |isbn=9781452265568 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AP1yAwAAQBAJ |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gendered Society'', Michael Kimmel wrote that when privileged people do not feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race|last = Halley|first = Jean|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1442203075|location = |pages = 67, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

=== Examples of Privilege ===

====Workplace sexism====
{{synthesis|reason="Is that statistically significant?"|date=October 2018}}
Hays, a recruitment firm, sent the same job application to thousands of employers, only changing the name. One was "Simon", the other "Susan". Experienced hiring managers offered "Simon" an interview 15% more often than "Susan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-same-resume-with-different-names-nets-different-results/news-story/a2a182fb4570e948c27ce63139ee66b1 | title=The same resume with different names nets different results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational Racism====
According to McKinley et al.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Students of color are pushed toward academic failure and continued social disenfranchisement. Racist policies and beliefs, in part, explain why children and young adults from racially marginalized groups fail to achieve academically at the same rate as their White peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, Angelina E. Castagno and Emma Maughan
Review of Research in Education 
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning (2007), pp. 159-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of privilege has been criticized for ignoring relative differences among groups. For example, Lawrence Blum argued that in American culture there are status differences among [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[Cambodian American|Cambodians]], and among [[African American]]s, black immigrants from the [[Caribbean American|Caribbean]], and black immigrants from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/publications/publications/A57.pdf|title='White privilege': A mild critique|first=Lawrence|last=Blum|date=2008|journal=Theory and Research in Education|volume=6|doi=10.1177/1477878508095586|issue=6(3) |pages=309–321|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum agreed that privilege exists and is systemic yet nonetheless criticized the label itself, saying that the word "privilege" implies luxuries rather than rights, and arguing that some benefits of privilege such as unimpeded access to [[education]] and [[housing]] would be better understood as rights.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; "[[White privilege]]", Michael Monahan argued, would be more accurately described as the advantages gained by whites through historical disenfranchisement of non-whites rather than something that gives whites privilege above and beyond normal human status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monahan, Michael J.|year=2014|title=The concept of privilege: a critical appraisal|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1080/02580136.2014.892681|issn=0258-0136|eissn=2073-4867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sock''' and '''buskin''' are two ancient symbols of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Greek theatre, actors in tragic roles wore a boot called a [[buskin]] (Latin ''cothurnus'') that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[Soccus|sock]] (Latin ''soccus'').

[[Melpomene]], the muse of tragedy, is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing buskins. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], the muse of comedy, is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and comic’s socks. Some people refer to the masks themselves as "Sock and Buskin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Mackay|title=A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries Traced Etymologically to the Ancient Language of the British People as Spoken Before the Irruption of the Danes and Saxons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKXTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1887|publisher=S.

In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.

'''Transmediation''' is the process of translating a work into a different medium. The definition of what constitutes transmediation would depend on how medium is defined or interpreted. In [[Understanding Media|Understanding media]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] offered a quite broad of medium "an extension of ourselves": &lt;blockquote&gt;"In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30734000|title=Understanding media : the extensions of man|last=1911-1980.|first=McLuhan, Marshall,|others=Lapham, Lewis H.,|isbn=0262631598|edition=First MIT Press edition, 1994|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=30734000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From McLuhan's definition, it is possible to infer the definition of transmediation could involve at least two different dimensions: a [[sensory]]{{dn|date=October 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña|first=Ernesto|last2=James|first2=Kedrick|date=2018-04-10|title=Raw Harmonies: Transmediation through raw data|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01635|journal=Leonardo|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1162/leon_a_01635|issn=0024-094X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] translation. When referring to medium as a sensory mode, transmediation would require to move between sensory modes (e.g., visual to aural, aural to tactile). When referring to transmediation as semiotic translation, transmediation can refer to the process of "responding to cultural texts in a range of sign systems -- art, movement, sculpture, dance, music, and so on -- as well as in words." [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/semali2/ Semali and Fueyo] 

Transmediation may utilize more than one media form. All the components of a transmediated work are interlinked with each other to form the whole network. Therefore, transmediated works are closely linked to semiotics and technology in the context of digital media. Transmediation can include response to traditional printed texts, as well as [[multimedia]] materials including [[video]], [[animation]], a [[website]], a [[podcast]], a [[game]], etc.

Transmediation is closely linked to [[semiotics]], which is the impact study of signs. Academic researchers and educators interested in transmediation are often also interested in [[media literacy]], [[visual literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[critical literacy]].

[http://www.edutopia.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=art_1361&amp;issue=oct_05 Leonard Shlain] highlights the importance of engaging students in the process of transmediation when writing, "Digital information comes in multiple forms, and students must learn to tell stories not just with words and numbers but also through images, graphics, color, sound, music, and dance. There is a grammar and literacy to each of these forms of communication. Bombarded with a wide variety of images regularly, students need sharp visual-interpretation skills to interact with the media analytically. Each form of communication has its own rules and grammar and should be taught in ways that lead students to be more purposeful, specific, and concise in communicating."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C. Baker |chapter=Syntax |title=The Handbook of Linguistics |editor=Mark Aronoff |editor2=Janie Rees-Miller |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-4051-0252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Women's rights''' are the [[rights]] and [[entitlement]]s claimed for [[women]] and [[girl]]s worldwide, and formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the nineteenth century and [[feminist movement]] during the 20th century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of [[human rights]] through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.&lt;ref name="Hosken"&gt;Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May 1981), pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right: to bodily integrity and [[autonomy]]; to be free from [[sexual violence]]; to [[women's suffrage|vote]]; to hold public office; to enter into legal contracts; to have equal rights in [[family law]]; [[right to work|to work]]; to fair wages or [[equal pay for equal work|equal pay]]; to have [[reproductive rights]]; to [[right to property|own property]]; [[Right to education|to education]].&lt;ref name=quarterly&gt;Lockwood, Bert B.

In ancient Egypt women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a men, however rightful entitlements depended upon [[social class]]. Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property.

Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the [[city states]] of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women of Ancient Greece|last = Nardo|first = Don|publisher = Lucent Books|year = 2000|location = San Diego|page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records also exist of women in ancient [[Delphi]], [[Gortyn]], [[Thessaly]], [[Megara]] and [[Sparta]] owning land, the most prestigious form of [[private property]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 33| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[Women in Classical Athens]] had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the ''[[oikos]]'' headed by the male ''[[Kurios|kyrios]]''. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman's ''kyrios''. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the ''kyrios'' would do so on their behalf.&lt;ref name="google114"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 114| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only acquire rights over [[property]] through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her ''kyrios'' had the right to dispose of a woman's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 115| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only enter into a contract worth less than the value of a "''[[medimno]]s'' of barley" (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading.&lt;ref name="google114"/&gt; Women were excluded from ancient [[Athenian democracy]], both in principle and in practice.

This separation would entail living in a room called a ''[[gynaeceum|gynaikeion]]'', while looking after the duties in the home and having very little exposure with the male world. This was also to ensure that wives only had legitimate children from their husbands. Athenian women received little education, except home tutorship for basic skills such as spin, weave, cook and some knowledge of money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although [[Spartan]] women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tierney| first = Helen| title = Women's studies encyclopaedia, Volume 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1999| pages = 609–10| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&amp;dq=spartan+women| isbn = 978-0-313-31072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B.

[[Plato]] acknowledged that extending [[civil and political rights]] to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 300| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| pages = 32–35| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to these views, the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophers]] argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="Colish"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages: Stoicism in classical Latin literature |last=Colish |first=Marcia L. |year=1990 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-09327-0 |pages=37–38  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WY-2MeZqoK0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=stoics%2Bslavery#v=onepage&amp;q=stoics%2Bslavery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they followed the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity, and practiced these views in their lives as well as their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;

{{Details|Women in ancient Rome}}
Roman law, similar to Athenian law, was created by men in favor of men.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Se|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 422–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women had no public voice, and no public role which only improved after the 1st century to the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[A. N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211, 268; Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeborn women of [[ancient Rome]] were [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] who enjoyed legal privileges and protections that did not extend to [[peregrinus (Roman)|non-citizens]] or [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman society]], however, was [[patriarchal]], and women could not vote, hold [[Roman magistrate|public office]], or serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268; Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the upper classes exercised political influence through marriage and motherhood. During the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Cornelia Africana|mother of the Gracchus brothers]] and [[Aurelia Cotta|of Julius Caesar]] were noted as exemplary women who advanced the career of their sons. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], women of the emperor's family could acquire considerable political power, and were regularly depicted in official art and on coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, "The Emperor and His Advisors", ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University History, 2000), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of the Roman society was the ''[[pater familias]]'' or the male head of the household who exercised his authority over all his children, servants, and wife.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="David Johnston 1999 p. 134"&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, '' A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Chapter IV; Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Athenian women, Roman women had a guardian or as it was called "tutor" who managed and oversaw all her activity.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; This tutelage had limited female activity but by first century to sixth century BCE, tutelage became very relaxed and women were accepted to participate in more public roles such as owning or managing property and or acting as municipal patrons for gladiator games and other entertainment activities&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Childbearing was encouraged by the state. By 27–14 BCE the ''[[ius trium liberorum]]'' ("legal right of three children") granted symbolic honors and legal privileges to a woman who had given birth to three children, and freed her from any male guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest period of the [[Roman Republic]], a bride passed from her father's control into the "hand" ''(manus)'' of her husband.

[[File:Bronze young girl reading CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Bronze statuette of a young woman reading (latter 1st century)]]
The first [[Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]], framed his ascent to sole power as a return to [[mos maiorum|traditional morality]], and attempted to regulate the conduct of women through [[Leges Iuliae|moral legislation]]. [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|Adultery]], which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Severy, ''Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Empire'' (Routledge, 2002; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defined broadly as an illicit sex act ''([[stuprum]])'' that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. Therefore, a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery when he had sex with a [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]], [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slave]], or person of marginalized status ''([[infamia|infamis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McGinn, "Concubinage and the Lex Iulia on Adultery", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 121 (1991), p. 342; Nussbaum, "The Incomplete Feminism of Musonius Rufus", p. 305, noting that custom "allowed much latitude for personal negotiation and gradual social change"; [[Elaine Fantham]], "''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome", in ''Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 124, citing [[Papinian]], ''De adulteriis'' I and [[Modestinus]], ''Liber Regularum'' I.

[[Stoicism|Stoic philosophies]] influenced the development of Roman law. Stoics of the Imperial era such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Musonius Rufus]] developed theories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|just relationships]]. While not advocating equality in society or under the law, they held that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously, and that therefore men and women had an equal need for philosophical education.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; These philosophical trends among the ruling elite are thought to have helped improve the status of women under the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ratnapala| first = Suri| title = Jurisprudence| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009| pages =134–35 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=tNwdWlXxZt8C&amp;dq=Stoic+law+women| isbn = 978-0-521-61483-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had no system of state-supported schooling, and education was available only to those who could pay for it.

====Byzantine Empire====
Since Byzantine law was essentially based on Roman law, the legal status of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in the public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 440–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women'roles being domestic instead of being public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There was also a growing trend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but they could still inherit properties and own land.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As a rule the influence of the church was exercised in favor of the abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious life, and of due provision for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were friendly toward the clergy. The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as tutors was sanctioned by Justinian.

The restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high rank with women of low rank were extended by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], but it was almost entirely removed by [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Second marriages were discouraged, especially by making it legal to impose a condition that a widow's right to property should cease on remarriage, and the [[Leonine Constitutions]] at the end of the 9th century made third marriages punishable. The same constitutions made the benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Volume 28|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=1911|isbn=|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|location=|pages=783|chapter=Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
[[File:Bound_feet_(X-ray).jpg|thumb|right|[[Foot binding]], a practice commonly inflicted on [[Women in China|Chinese women]] between the 10th century and the early 20th century. The image shows an X-ray of two bound feet.]]
{{Main|Women in ancient and imperial China|Women in China}}
Women throughout historical and ancient China were considered inferior and had subordinate legal status based on the [[Confucianism|Confucian law]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 426–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Imperial China, the "[[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|Three Obediences]]" promoted daughters to obey their fathers, wives to obey their husbands, and widows to obey their sons. Women could not inherit businesses or wealth&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and men had to adopt a son for such financial purposes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Late imperial law also featured seven different types of divorces. A wife could be ousted if she failed to birth a son, committed adultery, disobeyed her parents-in-law, spoke excessively, stole, was given to bouts of jealousy, or suffered from an incurable or loathsome disease or disorder.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But there were also limits for the husband – for example, he could not divorce if she observed her parent's in-law's mourning sites, if she had no family to return to, or if the husband's family used to be poor and since then had become richer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The status of women in China was also low largely due to the custom of [[foot binding]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} About 45% of Chinese women had bound feet in the 19th century. For the upper classes, it was almost 100%. In 1912, the Chinese government ordered the cessation of foot-binding. Foot-binding involved alteration of the bone structure so that the feet were only about 4 inches long. The bound feet caused difficulty of movement, thus greatly limiting the activities of women.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near each other, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Inasmuch.html?id=04TOSAAACAAJ |title=Inasmuch |author=Mary H.

Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, USA. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan"&gt;Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, "Piloted to Serve", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piloted to Serve97 personen vinden dit leuk |url=https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe |title=Piloted to Serve |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Republic of China (1912–49)]] and earlier Chinese governments, women were legally bought and sold into slavery under the guise of domestic servants. These women were known as [[Mui Tsai]]. The lives of Mui Tsai were recorded by American feminist [[Agnes Smedley]] in her book Portraits of Chinese Women in Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Parts of this book are available online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKReN05ujW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Portraits+of+Chinese+Women+in+Revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI-Led7NLlxgIVjSmICh3LRwWC#v=onepage&amp;q=Portraits%20of%20Chinese%20Women%20in%20Revolution&amp;f=false], at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1949 the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had been overthrown by communist guerillas led by [[Mao Zedong]], and the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in the same year. In May 1950 the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted the [[New Marriage Law]] to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed marriage by proxy and made marriage legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the legal age of marriage to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".

The [[Qur'an]], revealed to [[Muhammad]] over the course of 23 years, provided guidance to the [[Islamic community]] and modified existing customs in Arab society.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L.

Syracuse University Press. {{ISBN|0-8156-2908-7}} (pbk); p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; From 610 and 661, known as the [[early reforms under Islam]], the Qur'an introduced fundamental reforms to customary law and introduced rights for women in marriage, divorce, and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]]. By providing that the wife, not her family, would receive a dowry from the husband, which she could administer as her personal property, the Qur'an made women a legal party to the [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in customary law, inheritance was limited to male descendants, the Qur'an introduced rules on inheritance with certain fixed shares being distributed to designated heirs, first to the nearest female relatives and then the nearest male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]] "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, [[Fiqh|Islamic legislation]] meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]], to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schimmel| first = Annemarie| title = Islam | publisher = SUNY Press| year = 1992| page = 65| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m7oKd-H1BzYC&amp;dq=compared+to+the+pre-Islamic+position+of+women,+Islamic+legislation+meant+an+enormous+progress%3B+the+woman+has+the+right,+at+least+according+to+the+letter+of+the+law,+to+administer+the+wealth+she+has+brought+into+the+family+or+has+earned+by+her+own+work| isbn = 978-0-7914-1327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medieval women hunting.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Women performing tasks during the Middle Ages]]
Women's rights were protected already by early Medieval Christian Church: one of the first formal legal provision for the right of wives was promulgated by [[Council of Agde|council of Adge]] in 506, which in Canon XVI stipulated that if a young married man wished to be ordained, he required the consent of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIjEVrB3b4kC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768|last=Halfond|first=Gregory I.|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004179763|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Church and culture in the Middle Ages regarded women as weak, irrational and vulnerable to temptation who was constantly needed to be kept in check.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in England in the middle ages|last = Ward|first = Jennifer|publisher = A &amp; C Black|year = 2006|isbn = 1852853468|location = New York|pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2017}} This was reflected on the Christian culture in England through the story of [[Adam and Eve]] where Eve fell to Satan's temptations and led Adam to eat the apple. It was belief based on St.Paul, that the pain of childbirth was a punishment for this deed that led mankind to be banished from the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's inferiority also appears in many medieval writing for example the 1200 AD theologian [[Jacques de Vitry]] (who was rather sympathetic to women over others) emphasized for female obedience towards their men and expressed women as being slippery, weak, untrustworthy, devious, deceitful and stubborn.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The church also promoted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as a role model for women to emulate by being innocent in her sexuality, being married to a husband and eventually becoming a mother. That was the core purpose set out both culturally and religiously across Medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rape was also seen in medieval England as a crime against the father or husband and violation of their protection and guardianship of the women whom they look after in the household.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's identity in the Middle Ages was also referred through her relations with men she was associated with for example "His daughter" or "So and so's wife".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite all this, the Church still emphasized on the importance of love and mutual counselling within a marriage and prohibited any form of divorce so the wife would have someone to look after her.

In the legal system, women were regarded as the properties of men so any threat or injury to them was in the duty of their male guardians.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In Irish law, women were forbidden to act as witnesses in courts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, they could not be members of a jury and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Medieval Western European Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k09yF2Ub-pYC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=women+in+middle+ages+law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY4_jzj9PJAhWMaxQKHUFmA6AQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=women%2520in%2520middle%2520ages%2520law&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 12 November 2012|isbn = 9781136522031|first = Linda E.|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.

The Swedish law protected women from the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives.&lt;ref name="Beattie"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Married Women and the Law in Premodern Northwest Europe|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=36uGH4HNUWoC|publisher = Boydell Press|date = 1 January 2013|isbn = 9781843838333|first = Cordelia|last = Beattie|first2 = Matthew Frank|last2 = Stevens}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wife's property and land also could not be taken by the husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; This mean a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. In Swedish law, women would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in their treatment towards women than most European countries.

Medieval marriages among the elites were arranged in a way that would meet the interests of the family as a whole.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Theoretically a woman needed to consent before a marriage took place and the Church encouraged this consent to be expressed in present tense and not future.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Marriage could also take place anywhere and minimum age for girls would have to be 12 while 14 for boys.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Northern Europe====
The rate of [[Weregild|Wergild]]  suggested that women in these societies were valued mostly for their breeding purposes. The [[Weregild|Wergild]] of woman was double that of a man with same status in the [[Alemannic German|Aleman]] and [[Bavaria]]n legal codes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women In Dark Age and Early Medieval Europe|last = Jewell|first = Helen M|publisher = Palgrave Mcmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 0333912594|location = New York|pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weregild|Wergild]] of a woman meanwhile was triple that of a man with same status in [[Salian Franks|Salic]] and Repuarian legal codes for women of child bearing age, which constituted from 12–40 years old.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; One of the most Germanic codes from the [[Lombards|Lombard]] tradition, legislated that women be under the control of a male ''mundoald'' which constituted her father, husband, older son or eventually the king as a last resort if she had no male relatives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A woman needed her mundold's permission to manage property but still could own her own lands and goods. Certain areas with [[Visigoths|Visgothic]] inheritance laws until the 7th century were favorable to women while all the other laws were not.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Before Christianization of Europe, there was little space for women's consent for marriage and marriage through purchase  (or ''Kaufehe'') was actually the civil norm as opposed to the alternative marriage through capture (or ''Raubehe'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However Christianity was slow to reach other Baltic and Scandinavian areas with it only reaching King [[Harald Bluetooth]] of Denmark in the year 950 AD.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Those living under [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and [[Iceland]]ic laws used  marriages to forge alliances or create peace usually without the women's say or consent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However divorce rights were permitted to women who suffered physical abuse but protections from harm were not given to those termed "wretched" women such as beggars, servants and slave women. Having sex with them through force or without consent usually had zero legal consequence or punishment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During the [[Viking Age]], women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Grágás]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as ''odalkvinna'', all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could, further more, inherit not only property, but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother: a woman with such status was referred to as ''[[ringkvinna]]'', and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as for example the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, unless she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  
After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as ''maer'' and ''mey'', reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages was normally arranged by the clan.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.
Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (''gydja'') and oracles (''sejdkvinna'');&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ingelman-Sundberg, Catharina, ''Forntida kvinnor: jägare, vikingahustru, prästinna'' [Ancient women: hunters, viking wife, priestess], Prisma, Stockholm, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; they were active within art as poets (''skalder'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[rune master]]s, and as merchants and medicine women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   They may also have been active within military office: the stories about [[shieldmaiden]]s is unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the [[Birka female Viking warrior]] may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed. 
A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie &amp; Strömberg, Ulla-Britt, Tusen svenska kvinnoår: svensk kvinnohistoria från vikingatid till nutid, 3. (A Thousand Swedish Women's Years: Swedish Women's History from the Viking Age until now), [omarb. och utök.] uppl., Norstedts akademiska förlag, Stockholm, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married: a woman in such a position was called ''frilla''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there was no "legitimate" or "illegitimate" children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
These liberties gradually disappeared from the changed after the introductions of Christianity, and from the late 13th-century, they are no longer mentioned.&lt;ref name="Anamma 2002"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: ''Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet'' (''Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality'') Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christian Middle Ages, the [[Medieval Scandinavian law]] applied different laws depending of the local county law, signifying that the status of women could vary depending of which county she was living in.

====Europe====
=====16th and 17th century Europe=====
[[File:Malleus maleficarum, Köln 1520, Titelseite.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]), a book endorsing the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|extermination of witches]].]]
[[File:Witches Being Hanged.jpg|thumb|An image of suspected witches being hanged in England, published in 1655]]
The 16th and 17th century saw numerous [[witch trial]]s, which resulted in thousands of people across Europe being executed, of whom 75-95% were women (depending on time and place).&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Killing Women – Gender, Sorcery, and Violence in Late Medieval Germany|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUfhZceOsrgC|publisher = GRIN Verlag|date = 1 November 2010|isbn = 9783640741830|first = James|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executions mostly took place in German-speaking lands, and during the 15th century the terminology "witchcraft" was definitely viewed as something feminine as opposed to prior years.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Famous witchcraft manuals such as the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' and ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus|Summis Desiderantes]]''  depicted witches as diabolical conspirators who worshipped Satan and were primarily women. Culture and art at the time depicted these witches as seductive and evil, further fuelling moral panic in fusion with rhetoric from the Church.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

The origin of the female "witch" myth traces back to Roman mythical night creatures known as Strix, who were thought to appear and disappear mysteriously in the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; They were also believed by many to be of transformed women by their own supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This Roman myth itself is believed to  originate from the Jewish Sabbath which described non-supernatural women who would suspiciously leave and return home swiftly during the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Authors of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' strongly established the link between witchcraft and women by proclaiming greater likelihood for women to be addicted to "evil".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Late Medieval and Reformation Europe|last = Jewell|first = Helen M.|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 0333912578|location = New York|pages = 123–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors and inquisitors [[Heinrich Kramer]] and Jacob Sprengerh justified these beliefs by claiming women had greater credulity, impressionability, feeble minds, feeble bodies, impulsivity and carnal natures which were flaws susceptible to "evil" behavior and witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These sort of beliefs at the time could send female hermits or beggars to trials just for offering remedies or herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These set of developed myths eventually lead to the 16-17th century witch trials which found thousands of women burned at stake.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

By 1500, Europe was divided into two types of secular law.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 428–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was customary law which was predominant in northern France, England and Scandinavia, and the other was Roman based written laws which was predominant in southern France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Customary laws favoured men more than women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, inheritance among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was passed on to the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, do certain trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In areas governed by Roman-based written laws women were under male guardianship in matters involving property and law, fathers overseeing daughters, husbands overseeing wives and uncles or male relatives overseeing widows.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Throughout Europe, women's legal status centered around her marital status while marriage itself was the biggest factor in restricting women's autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Custom, statue and practice not only reduced women's rights and freedoms but prevented single or widowed women from holding public office on the justification that they might one day marry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965.&lt;ref name="Badr-1984"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–69 |doi=10.2307/840274|ref=harv|author2=Mayer, Ann Elizabeth|publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers [[Jane Anger]], [[Emilia Lanier|Aemilia Lanyer]], and the prophetess [[Anna Trapnell]].

Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 75. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-1189-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite relatively greater freedom for [[Anglo-Saxon women]], until the mid-19th century, writers largely assumed that a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal order]] was a natural order that had always existed.&lt;ref name="Maine"&gt;Maine, Henry Sumner. Ancient Law 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; This perception was not seriously challenged until the 18th century when [[Jesuit]] missionaries found [[matrilineality]] in native North American peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph-François Lafitau|Lafitau, Joseph François]], cited by Campbell, Joseph in, Myth, religion, and mother-right: selected writings of JJ Bachofen. Manheim, R (trans.) Princeton, N.J. 1967 introduction xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[John Locke]] opposed marital inequality and the mistreatment of women during this time.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender and Good Governance in John Locke|url = http://www.ajsih.org/index.php/ajsih/article/view/56|journal = American Journal of Social Issues and Humanities|date = 19 July 2012|issn = 2276-6928|volume = 2|issue = 4|first = Ikechukwu|last = Anthony|first2 = O. S. A.|last2 = Kanu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well known for advocating for marital equality among the sexes in his work during the 17th century. According to a study published in the ''American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities,'' the condition for women during Locke's time were as quote:&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  English women had fewer grounds for divorce than men until 1923 &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Husbands controlled most of their wives' personal property until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]] and [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Children were the husband's property&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Rape was legally impossible within a marriage&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
*  Wives lacked crucial features of legal personhood, since the husband was taken as the representative of the family (thereby eliminating the need for women's suffrage). These legal features of marriage suggest that the idea of a marriage between equals appeared unlikely to most Victorians.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; (Quoted from ''Gender and Good Governance in John Locke, American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities Vol 2''&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;)

Other philosophers have also made the statements regarding women's rights during this time. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in ''An Occasional Letter on the Female Sex 1775'' where he states (as quote) :&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The English Literatures of America: 1500-1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsRmAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 19 December 2013|isbn = 9781317795407|language = en|first = Myra|last = Jehlen|first2 = Michael|last2 = Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If we take a survey of ages and of countries, we shall find the women, almost without exception... adored and oppressed... they are ... robbed of freedom of will by the laws...Yet such, I am sorry to say, is the lot of women over the whole earth. Man with regard to them, has been either an insensible husband or an oppressor."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A paternal society can find prefer to make women's rights a man's duty, for instance under English common law husbands had to maintain their wives. This duty was abolished in 2010.&lt;ref name="UKEqualityAct"&gt;{{cite web |title=Equality Act 2010 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15 |publisher=UK Government Legislation |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OldLawsOfEngland"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sir William Blackstone |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769) |url=https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115 |website=Lonang Institute |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social, and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded [[freedom of religion]], the abolition of [[slavery]], rights for women, rights for those who did not own property, and [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sweet| first = William| title = Philosophical theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights| publisher = University of Ottawa Press| year = 2003| page = 4| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_V_KuJGcJSAC&amp;dq=%22natural+law%22+women+%22human+nature%22| isbn =978-0-7766-0558-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], for example, thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| pages = 29–30| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| id = | isbn =978-0-8122-1854-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that: "This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society". The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as "almost a parody...of the original document". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility." The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: "Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility". De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:

"All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1869 essay "[[The Subjection of Women]]" the English philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women deserve the [[right to vote]], though his proposal to replace the term "man" with "person" in the second [[Reform Bill of&amp;nbsp;1867]] was greeted with laughter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and defeated by 76&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries&lt;ref name="Brave new world – Women's rights"/&gt; but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women's suffrage in Britain.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; Initially only one of several women's rights campaigns, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women's movement at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The women’s suffrage movement in Britain, 1866–1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-0-312-21853-9 |pages=1–2 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within British jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as [[property law]] and [[marriage law]] gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by the [[Reform Act 1832]] and the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;Phillips, Melanie, ''The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement'' (Abacus, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] led the public campaign on women's suffrage and in 1918 a bill was passed allowing women over the age of 30 to vote.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

By the 1860s, the economic sexual politics of middle class women in Britain and its neighboring Western European countries was guided by factors such as the evolution of 19th century [[Consumerism|consumer]] culture, including the emergence of the [[department store]], and [[Separate spheres]].
In ''Come Buy, Come Buy: Shopping and the Culture of Consumption in Victorian Women's Writing'', Krista Lysack's literary analysis of 19th century contemporary literature claims through her resources' reflection of common contemporary norms, "Victorian femininity as characterized by self-renunciation and the regulation of appetite."&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"&gt;Lysack, Krista. Come buy, come buy : shopping and the culture of consumption in Victorian women's writing. n.p.: Athens : Ohio University Press, c2008., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; And while women, particularly those in the middle class, obtained modest control of daily household expenses and had the ability to leave the house, attend social events, and shop for personal and household items in the various department stores developing in late 19th century Europe, Europe's socioeconomic climate pervaded the ideology that women were not in complete control over their urges to spend (assuming) their husband or father's wages. As a result, many advertisements for socially 'feminine' goods revolved around upward social progression, [[exoticism]]s from the [[Orient]], and added efficiency for household roles women were deemed responsible for, such as cleaning, childcare, and cooking.&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Erika Diane.

=====Russia=====
By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was a patriarchal society that subordinated women to men, and the young to their elders. [[Peter the Great|Peter the great]] relaxed the second custom, but not the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = 443–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In terms of laws, there were double standards to women. Adulterous wives were sentenced to forced labor, while men who murdered their wives were merely flogged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the death Peter the Great, laws and customs pertaining to men's marital authority over their wives increased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1782, civil law reinforced women's responsibility to obey her husband.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1832, the Digest of laws changed this  obligation into "unlimited obedience".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 18th century, Russian orthodox church further got its authority over marriage and banned priests from granting divorce, even for severely abused wives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1818, Russian senate had also forbade separation of married couples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During [[World War I]], caring for children was increasingly difficult for women, many of whom could not support themselves, and whose husbands had died or were fighting in the war. Many women had to give up their children to children's homes infamous for abuse and neglect. These children's homes were unofficially dubbed as "angel factories". After the [[October Revolution]], the Bolsheviks shut down an infamous angel factory known as the 'Nikolaev Institute' situated near the Moika Canal. The Bolsheviks then replaced the Nikolaev Institute with a modern maternity home called the 'Palace for Mothers and Babies'. This maternity home was used by the [[Bolsheviks]] as a model for future maternity hospitals. The countess who ran the old Institute was moved to a side wing, however she spread rumours that the Bolsheviks had removed sacred pictures, and that the nurses were promiscuous with sailors. The maternity hospital was burnt down hours before it was scheduled to open, and the countess was suspected of being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Cathy |date=1987 |title=Women in Revolutionary Russia |location=Great Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=39 |isbn=0 521 31969 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which women could participate in [[Japanese society]] has varied over time and social classes. In the 8th century, Japan had women emperors, and in the 12th century ([[Heian period]]) women in Japan occupied a relatively high status, although still subordinated to men. 
From the late [[Edo period]], the status of women declined. In the 17th century, the "[[Onna Daigaku]]", or "Learning for Women", by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] author [[Kaibara Ekken]], spelled out expectations for Japanese women, lowering significantly their status.&lt;ref name=Ekken&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekken|first1=Kaibara|title=Onna Daigaku A Treasure Box of Women's Learning.|date=2010|publisher=Gardners Books|isbn=0955979676|url=https://archive.org/stream/womenwisdomofjap00kaib/womenwisdomofjap00kaib_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Meiji period]], industrialization and urbanization reduced the authority of fathers and husbands, but at the same time the Meiji Civil Code of 1898 denied women legal rights and subjugated them to the will of household heads.&lt;ref name="Womeninworldhistory"&gt;[http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/WR-04.html The Meiji Reforms and Obstacles for Women Japan, 1878–1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 20th century the status of women improved greatly. Although Japan is often considered a very conservative country, it was in fact earlier than many European countries on giving women legal rights in the 20th century, as the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]]  provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women’s equality in Japan. Japan for instance enacted women's suffrage in 1946, earlier than several European countries such as [[Switzerland]] (1971 at federal level; 1990 on local issues in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]]), [[Portugal]] (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931), [[San Marino]] in 1959, [[Monaco]] in 1962, [[Andorra]] in 1970, and [[Liechtenstein]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/votes_to_women.shtml|title=Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Timeline:When women got the vote|author=BBC|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voter Turnout in Western Europe Since 1945: A Regional Report |author1=Rafael López Pintor |author2=Maria Gratschew |author3=Tim Bittiger |publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance |year=2004 |isbn=978-9185391004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Australia=====
[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Australia's first female political candidate, [[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] (1825-1910)]]
The history of women's rights in [[Australia]] is a contradictory one: while Australia led the world in women's suffrage rights in the 19th century, it has been very slow in recognizing women's professional rights - it was not until 1966 that its [[marriage bar]] was removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://lrrpublic.cli.det.nsw.edu.au/lrrSecure/Sites/Web/pre_liberation/other/restrictions_pop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, reforms which allowed women both to vote and stand for office  in [[South Australia]] in the late 19th century  were a cornerstone for women's political rights in other parts of the world. In this regard, Australia differs from other cultures, in that women's suffrage in Australia was one of the earliest objectives of the feminist movement there (beginning with South Australia and Western Australia) unlike other cultures, such as Eastern European cultures, where at the turn of the 20th century the feminist movement  focused on [[labour rights]], access to professions and education, rather than political rights. To this day, Australia has a quite low percentage of women in business executive roles compared to other countries with equivalent corporate structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/australian-firms-trail-world-for-women-in-top-roles-11008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core concepts==
=== Natural rights ===
17th century [[natural law]] philosophers in Britain and America, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[John Locke]], developed the theory of [[natural rights]] in reference to ancient philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and the Christian theologist [[Aquinas]]. Like the ancient philosophers, 17th century natural law philosophers defended [[slavery]] and an inferior status of women in law.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 282 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on ancient Greek philosophers, natural law philosophers argued that [[natural rights]] were not derived from god, but were "universal, self-evident, and intuitive", a law that could be found in nature. They believed that natural rights were self-evident to "civilised man" who lives "in the highest form of society".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 297 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights derived from [[human nature]], a concept first established by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Citium]] in ''Concerning Human Nature''. Zenon argued that each rational and civilized male Greek citizen had a "divine spark" or "soul" within him that existed independent of the body. Zeno founded the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] and the idea of a human nature was adopted by other Greek philosophers, and later [[natural law]] philosophers and western [[humanists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 214 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle developed the widely adopted idea of [[rationality]], arguing that man was a "rational animal" and as such a natural power of reason. Concepts of human nature in ancient Greece depended on gender, ethnic, and other qualifications&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 212 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17th century natural law philosophers came to regard women along with children, slaves and non-whites, as neither "rational" nor "civilised".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"/&gt; Natural law philosophers claimed the inferior status of women was "common sense" and a matter of "nature". They believed that women could not be treated as equal due to their "inner nature".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; The views of 17th century natural law philosophers were opposed in the 18th and 19th century by [[evangelical]] [[natural theology]] philosophers such as [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Charles Spurgeon]], who argued for the abolition of slavery and advocated for women to have rights equal to that of men.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; Modern natural law theorists, and advocates of natural rights, claim that all people have a human nature, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other qualifications, therefore all people have natural rights.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"/&gt;

{{Further|Employment discrimination law in the European Union}}
[[Labour law|Employment rights]] for women include non-discriminatory access of women to jobs and [[equal pay]]. The rights of women and men to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the [[British Hong Kong]] Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkccsa.org/ |title=香港政府華員會 |publisher=Hkccsa.org |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torontosun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|title=Celebrating two lives well lived &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Toronto Sun|publisher=m.torontosun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716175556/http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawasun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos|publisher=ottawasun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704133812/http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connor |first=Kevin |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled |title=Life, love and service &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2012-04-08/city1333873203d3799095.html |title=曾參與二戰及香港保衛戰華裔夫婦.加美軍方墓前致最高敬意_星島日報_加拿大多倫多中文新聞網。 Canada Toronto Chinese newspaper |publisher=News.singtao.ca |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |title=世界日報電子報 – World Journal ePaper |publisher=Epapertor.worldjournal.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812123852/http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |title=明報新聞網海外版 – 加東版(多倫多) – Canada Toronto Chinese Newspaper – 社區新聞 |publisher=Mingpaotor.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812061427/http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in [[France]] until 1965&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Spain]] until 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm|title=Spain – SOCIAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[marriage bar]]s, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=23196053|title=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/history/scotland_britain_1880_now/employment_women/revision/3/|title=Standard Grade Bitesize History – Women and work : Revision, p. 3|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Women's suffrage}}
During the 19th century some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the [[right to vote]] – the right to participate in their government and its law making.&lt;ref name=Krolokke&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Other women opposed suffrage, like [[Helen Kendrick Johnson]], who argued in the 1897 pamphlet ''Woman and the Republic'' that women could achieve legal and economic equality without having the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|author=Kaevan Gazdar|publisher= John Hunt Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=Helen+Kendrick+Johnson+women%27s+rights&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih0Lja_ZrVAhUFnRQKHQdIA20Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Helen%20Kendrick%20Johnson%20women%27s%20rights&amp;f=false|year=2016 |isbn=978-1-78099-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]). During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/womenx2019s-suffrage |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Nordic countries]] gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century – Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War many other countries followed – the [[Netherlands]] (1917), [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]].

Late adopters in Europe were [[Greece]] in 1952, [[Switzerland]] (1971 at federal level; 1959–1991 on local issues at canton level), [[Portugal]] (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931) as well as the [[microstates]] of [[San Marino]] in 1959, [[Monaco]] in 1962, [[Andorra]] in 1970, and [[Liechtenstein]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/votes_to_women.shtml|title=Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Timeline:When women got the vote|author=BBC|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voter Turnout in Western Europe Since 1945: A Regional Report |author1=Rafael López Pintor |author2=Maria Gratschew |author3=Tim Bittiger |publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance |year=2004 |isbn=978-9185391004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, most provinces enacted women's suffrage between 1917–1919, late adopters being [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1922, [[Newfoundland]] in 1925 and [[Quebec]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/ProvinceTerritory/ProvincialWomenRightToVote.aspx|title=Women's Right to Vote in Canada|work=parl.gc.ca|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – [[Ecuador]] (1929), [[Brazil]] (1932), [[El Salvador]] (1939), [[Dominican Republic]] (1942), [[Guatemala]] (1956) and [[Argentina]] (1946). In [[India]], under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid 20th century – [[Japan]] (1945), [[China]] (1947) and [[Indonesia]] (1955). In Africa, women generally got the right to vote along with men through universal suffrage – [[Liberia]] (1947), [[Uganda]] (1958) and [[Nigeria]] (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after World War II, although in others, such as [[Kuwait]], suffrage is very limited.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/16/kuwait.women/index.html |title="Kuwait grants women right to vote" CNN.com (May 16, 2005) |publisher=CNN |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property rights===
During the 19th century some women, such as [[Ernestine Rose]], [[Paulina Wright Davis]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the [[Women's Property Rights|right to their property]] once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act &amp;#124; 1848 &amp;#124; New York State |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |title=Property Rights Of Women |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805171942/http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts |title=Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&amp;#93;)&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html |title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Women's History&amp;nbsp;– Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights for women continued to be restricted in many European countries until legal reforms of the 1960-70s. For example, in [[West Germany]], the law pertaining to rural farm succession favored male heirs until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/inheritance-laws/germany.php&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Head and master]] laws, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, were common until a few decades ago. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'' (1981), declared such laws unconstitutional.

=== Freedom of movement ===
[[File:A_Chinese_Golden_Lily_Foot,_Lai_Afong,_c1870s.jpg|thumb|left|Woman with [[Foot binding|bound feet]], 1870s]]
[[File:Ladies cabul1848b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|''Ladies of [[Kabul|Caubul]]'' (1848 lithograph, by James Rattray) showing the lifting of [[purdah]] in [[zenana]] areas –  Oriental and India Office Collection, British Library]]
[[Freedom of movement]] is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including   Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 September 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archive-date=1 April 2011 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, women have this right severely restricted, in law or in practice. For instance, in some countries women may not leave the home without a male guardian,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034&lt;/ref&gt; or without the consent of the husband – for example the personal law of [[Yemen]] states that a wife must obey her husband and must not get out of the home without his consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries which do not have legal restrictions, women's movement  may be prevented in practice by social and religious norms such as [[purdah]]. Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently in some Western countries: until 1983, in [[Australia]] the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171552/http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Various practices have been used historically to restrict women's freedom of movement, such as [[foot binding]], the custom of applying painfully tight binding to the feet of young Chinese girls, which was common between the 10th and 20th century.

Women's freedom of movement may be restricted by laws, but it may also be restricted by attitudes towards women in public spaces. In areas where it is not socially accepted for women to leave the home, women who are outside may face abuse such as insults, sexual harassment and violence.
Many of the restrictions on women's freedom of movement are framed as measures to "protect" women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empowerwomen.org/en/who-we-are/news/2016/2/freedom-of-movement-and-womens-economic-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the summer of 2017, an India women named Varnika Kundu shared a story on Facebook about being stalked by two men late at night.  Kundu was coming home after a night out with friends when two men began following her.  Kundu made it home unharmed, but was understandably shaken after the incident.  She posted her story on Facebook, hoping to bring awareness and warn other women, but was instead met with a backlash of trolls telling her she shouldn't have been out that late and that it was her fault for being in that situation.  This incident spawned the #AintNoCinderella movement, where women all over the world shared pictures of them being out past midnight with the hashtag in order to combat gender stereotypes and bias.&lt;ref&gt;https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/aint-no-cinderella-women-fight-for-safety-by-sharing-late-night-photos-on-twitter-4787653/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informing women about their legal rights===
The lack of legal knowledge among many women, especially in developing countries, is a major obstacle in the improvement of women's situation. International bodies, such as the United Nations, have stated that the obligation of states does not only consist in passing relevant laws, but also in informing women about the existence of such laws, in order to enable them to seek justice and realize in practice their rights. Therefore, states must popularize the laws, and explain them clearly to the public, in order to prevent ignorance, or misconceptions originating in [[myth|popular myth]]s, about the laws. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrimination===
Women's rights movements focus on ending [[discrimination]] of women. In this regard, the definition of discrimination itself is important. According to the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]], the right to freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation of states to treat in the same way persons who are in  analogous  situations, but  also the obligation to treat in a different way  persons  who are in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Case%20of%20Thlimmenos%20v%20Greece%20_2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard equity, not just "equality" is important. Therefore, states must sometimes differentiate between women and men – through for example offering [[maternity leave]] or other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (to take into account the biological realities of [[reproduction]]), or through acknowledging a specific historical context. For example, acts of violence committed by men against women do not happen in a vacuum, but are part of a social context: in ''Opuz v Turkey'', the ECHR defined [[violence against women]] as a form of discrimination against women;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interights.org/opuz/index.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;para 200: "[T]he Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as ''gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women''&lt;/ref&gt; this is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which at Article 3 states that "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and ''a form of discrimination against women'' [...]".&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different views on where it is appropriate to differentiate between women and men, and one view is that the act of [[sexual intercourse]] is an act where this difference must be acknowledged, both due to the increased physical risks for the woman,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the historical context of women being systematically subjected to forced sexual intercourse while in a socially subordinated position (particularly [[marital rape|within marriage]] and [[Wartime sexual violence|during war]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31473687_Why_Sexual_Penetration_Requires_Justification&lt;/ref&gt; States must also differentiate with regard to healthcare by ensuring that [[women's health]] - particularly with regard to [[reproductive health]] such as [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] - is not neglected. According to the World Health Organization "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal of states to acknowledge the specific needs of women, such as the necessity  of specific policies like the strong investment of states in reducing [[maternal mortality]] can be a form of discrimination. In this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such as menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, breastfeeding, as well as certain medical conditions, only affect women. The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] stipulates in its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' that states should "Examine  gender neutral  laws  and  policies  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  create  or 
perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal or modify them if they do so".  (paragraph 32).&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of gender neutral policy which harms women is that where medication tested in [[medical trial]]s only on men is also used on women assuming that there are no biological differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4800017 | pmid=27011778 | doi=10.18549/PharmPract.2016.01.708 | volume=14 | title=Women's involvement in clinical trials: historical perspective and future implications | year=2016 | journal=Pharm Pract (Granada) | page=708 | last1 = Liu | first1 = KA | last2 = Mager | first2 = NA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to health===

[[Health]] is defined by the World Health Organization as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/about/mission/en/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's health]] refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women's health is severely impaired in some parts of the world, due to factors such as inequality, confinement of women to the home, indifference of medical workers, lack of autonomy of women, lack of financial resources of women.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/topics/womens_health/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Discrimination against women occurs also through denial of medical services that are only needed by women.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Violations of women's right to health may result in [[maternal death]], accounting for more than 300.000 deaths per year, most of them in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Certain traditional practices, such as [[female genital mutilation]], also affect women's health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, young women and adolescent girls are the population most affected by [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/hiv-and-aids/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to education===

The right to [[education]] is a universal entitlement to education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2011/pdfs/Infonote_Women_and_the_right_to_education.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] prohibits discrimination in education, with discrimination being defined as "any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference which, being based on race, colour, ''sex'', language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12949&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention against Discrimination in Education|work=unesco.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] states at Article 3 that "The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant", with Article 13 recognizing "the right of everyone to education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|work=ohchr.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women's right to access to academic education is recognized as very important, it is increasingly recognized that academic education must be supplemented with education on [[human rights]], [[non-discrimination]], [[ethics]] and [[gender equality]], in order for social advancement to be possible. This was pointed out by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], the current [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], who stressed the importance of human rights education for all children: "What good was it to humanity that [[Josef Mengele]] had advanced degrees in medicine and anthropology, given that he was capable of committing the most inhuman crimes? Eight of the 15 people who planned the [[Holocaust]] at Wannsee in 1942 held PhDs. They shone academically, and yet they were profoundly toxic to the world. [[Radovan Karadžić]] was a trained psychiatrist. [[Pol Pot]] studied radio electronics in Paris.

====Legal rights====
Reproductive rights are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]. Reproductive rights were endorsed by the twenty-year Cairo Programme of Action which was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], and by the [[Beijing Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action]] in 1995.

In the 1870s feminists advanced the concept of ''voluntary motherhood'' as a political critique of ''involuntary motherhood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 55 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing a desire for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 56 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of [[contraception]], arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of [[procreation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 57 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated for periodic or permanent [[abstinence]].&lt;ref name="Gordon 2002 59"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 59 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights represents a broad concept, that may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to [[birth control|control one's reproductive functions]], the right to access quality [[reproductive health]]care, and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make reproductive choices free from [[coercion]], discrimination, and violence.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=8 December 2007 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=20 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights may also be understood to include [[sex education|education]] about [[contraception]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html |title=Template |publisher=Nocirc.org |date=10 December 1993 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), and [[forced abortion]] and [[forced sterilization]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"/&gt; The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are understood as rights of both men and women, but are most frequently advanced as women's rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;

In the 1960s, reproductive rights activists promoted women's right to bodily autonomy, with these social movements leading to the gain of legal access to contraception and abortion  during the next decades in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/MFWL.html|title=The March for Women's Lives, April 2004|website=www.jofreeman.com|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth control====

[[File:Birth Control Review 1919.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|Cover of the 1919 ''Birth Control Review'', published by [[Margaret Sanger]]. In relation to "How shall we change the law?" Sanger wrote "...women appeal in vain for instruction concerning contraceptives.

The British birth control campaigner [[Marie Stopes]] made [[contraception]] acceptable in Britain during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms.

====Abortion====
[[File:Black March in support of abortion rights, Łódź October 2nd 2016 33.jpg|thumb|right|Access to abortion services varies considerably throughout the world, with the status of related rights being an active and major political topic in many nations.]]

Women's reproductive rights may be understood as including the right to easy access to a safe and legal abortion. [[Abortion law]]s vary from a full prohibition (the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, Nicaragua, the Vatican)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/22/chile-abortion-bill-michelle-bachelet-a-triumph-of-reason-ease-abortion-ban&lt;/ref&gt; to countries [[Abortion in Canada|such as Canada]], where there are no legal restrictions. In many countries where abortion is permitted by law, women may only have limited access to safe abortion services. In some countries abortion is permitted only to save the pregnant woman's life, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  [[conscientious objectors]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Abortion is a highly emotional subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112153841/http://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |archivedate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat to a wide range of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can argue that even though women die from unsafe abortion, the legalization of abortion is considered a human right violation since it supports a cause that deprives the unborn of their humanity, which must be respected, and therefore another solution is needed in order to avoid maternal deaths (e.g., psychological and physiological support during and after pregnancy) whilst also avoiding abortion. According to World Health Organization, 56 million abortions on average occurred worldwide each year in 2010-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/news/440KeyAbortionFactsFinal.pdf?ua=1 |title=Induced Abortion Worldwide |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American women are 5 times likely to have an abortion rather than a white woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2008/08/abortion-and-women-color-bigger-picture|title=Abortion and Women of Color: The Bigger Picture|date=2008-08-13|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] and many other [[Christianity|Christian faiths]], particularly those considered the [[Christian right]], and most [[Judaism and abortion|Orthodox Jews]] regard abortion not as a right, but as a [[moral evil]] and a [[Mortal sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia was the first country to legalise abortions and offer free medical care in state hospitals to do so. After the [[October Revolution]], the Women's wing of the [[Bolshevik]] Party (the Zhenotdel) persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a 'temporary measure'). The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.&lt;ref name="Porter 1987 43"/&gt;

====Abuse during childbirth====
{{Main|Abuse during childbirth}}
[[Abuse during childbirth|The abuse of women during childbirth]] is a recently identified global problem and a basic violation of a woman's rights.&lt;ref name = who1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth/en/|title=Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = who2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134588/1/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1 | title = The prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth | accessdate = 3 August 2017 | publisher = World Health organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse during childbirth is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a violation of the woman's rights. It also has the effect of preventing women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.

====Child marriage====
{{Main|Child marriage}}
Child marriage is a practice which is widespread across the world, and is often connected to poverty and gender inequality. Child marriage endangers the [[reproductive health]] of young girls, leading to an increased risk of  complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Such complications are a leading cause of death among girls in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced pregnancy====
{{Main|Forced pregnancy}}
Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). It is a form of [[reproductive coercion]], was common historically, and still occurs in parts of the world. In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from violence===
[[Violence against women]] is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.  The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"/&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women: "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, by groups, or by the State. It may occur in private or in public. Violence against women may be sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence, socioeconomic violence. Some forms of violence against women have long cultural traditions: [[honor killing]]s, [[Dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]]. Violence against women is considered by the World Health Organization "a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family law===
Under male dominated [[family law]], women had few, if any, rights, being under the control of the husband or male relatives. Legal concepts that existed throughout the centuries, such as [[coverture]], [[marital power]], [[Head and Master law]]s, kept women under the strict control of their husbands. Restrictions from marriage laws also extended to public life, such as [[marriage bar]]s. Practices such as [[dowry]] or [[bride price]] were, and still are to this day in some parts of the world, very common. Some countries continue to require to this day a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] for women, without whom women cannot exercise civil rights. Other harmful practices include marriage of young girls, often to much older men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "feminism" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=Waves of Feminism |publisher=Jofreeman.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) was the first women's organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington D.C. with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women's organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups and benevolent societies participate. National Councils are affiliated to the ICW and thus make themselves heard at international level. In 1904, the ICW met in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Helene Stöcker (2015): Lebenserinnerungen, hg. von Reinhold Lütgeeier-Davin u. Kerstin Wolff. Köln: Böhlau, 93, pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICW worked with the [[League of Nations]] during the 1920s and the [[United Nations]] post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lasaunne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his equal pay for equal work bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/620037.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tributes paid to veteran anti-royalist | date=27 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 29 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 December 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned".&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the USA, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=Now.org |date=29 October 1966 |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902232426/http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1 |title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women for Women International]] (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993 by [[Zainab Salbi]], an [[Iraqi American]] who is herself a survivor of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and Salbi's then-husband Amjad Atallah. Since June 2012, WfWI has been led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO."

The [[National Council of Women of Canada]] (Conseil national des femmes du Canada), is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] advocacy organization based in [[Ottawa]] aimed at improving conditions for women, families, and communities. A federation of nationally organized societies of men and women and local and provincial councils of women, it is the Canadian member of the [[International Council of Women]] (ICW). The Council has concerned itself in areas including [[women's suffrage]], immigration, [[health care in Canada|health care]], [[education in Canada|education]], mass media, [[environmentalism|the environment]], and many others.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-05-22T15%3A32%3A48Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=97640&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Apam | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115100209/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-05-22T15:32:48Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=97640&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/collectionscanada.gc.ca:pam | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 January 2013 | title = National Council of Women of Canada fonds | publisher = [[Library and Archives Canada]] | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed on 27 October 1857 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], it is one of the oldest advocacy organizations in the country.&lt;ref name = "encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005614 | title = National Council of Women of Canada | publisher = ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' | accessdate = 2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia]] is a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[Non-governmental organization]] founded to provide activism for [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women's rights]]. It was founded by [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]] and Fawzia Al-Uyyouni, and grew out of a 2007 movement to gain women the right to drive. The association is not officially licensed by the government of Saudi Arabia, and has been warned not to mount demonstrations.&lt;ref name="usgov2008"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview, al-Huwaider described the goals: "The association will consist of a number of leagues, with each league pursuing a different issue or right... representation for women in shari'a courts; setting a [minimum] age for girls' marriages; allowing women to take care of their own affairs in government agencies and allowing them to enter government buildings; protecting women from domestic violence, such as physical or verbal violence, or keeping her from studies, work, or marriage, or forcing her to divorce..."&lt;ref name="memri-huw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/2383.htm |title=Saudi Feminist Wajeha Al-Huweidar: The Campaign for Women's Right to Drive Saudi Arabia Is Just the Beginning |publisher=Memri.org |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ukraine]], [[FEMEN]] was founded in 2008. The organisation is internationally known for its topless protests against sex tourists, international marriage agencies, sexism and other social, national and international social illnesses. FEMEN has sympathisers groups in many European countries through social media.

=== United Nations and World Conferences ===
In 1946 the United Nations established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/|title=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Division for the Advancement of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/CSW60YRS/CSWbriefhistory.pdf|title=Short History of the Commission on the Status of Women|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally as the Section on the Status of Women, Human Rights Division, Department of Social Affairs, and now part of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC). Since 1975 the UN has held a series of world conferences on women's issues, starting with the World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City. These conferences created an international forum for women's rights, but also illustrated divisions between women of different cultures and the difficulties of attempting to apply principles universally.&lt;ref name=Catagay&gt;Catagay, N., Grown, C. and Santiago, A. 1986. "The Nairobi Women's Conference: Toward a Global Feminism?" Feminist Studies, 12, 2:401–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Four World Conferences have been held, the first in [[Mexico City]] ([[International Women's Year]], 1975), the second in [[Copenhagen]] (1980) and the third in [[Nairobi]] (1985). At the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing (1995), ''[[Beijing Platform for Action|The Platform for Action]]'' was signed. This included a commitment to achieve "[[gender equality]] and the empowerment of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html|title=Fourth World Conference on Women.

===Field organisations===
Regions where women's rights are less developed have produced interesting local organisations, such as:
* [[IIDA Women's Development Organisation]], a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[non-governmental organisation]], created by women in order to work for [[peacebuilding]] and women's rights defence in [[Somalia]], a country deprived of state structures and security since 1991,
* the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]], a [[civil society]] organisation founded in 1949, which develops a range of programmes in the field of health, nutrition, education, [[birth control]] and legal aid.

== Human rights ==

=== United Nations convention ===
{{main|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
[[File:CEDAW Participation.svg|right|upright=1.8|thumb| Participation in the CEDAW {{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#00aa00|Signed and ratified}}{{legend|#008000|Acceded or succeeded}}{{legend|#008080|Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#eeee00|Only signed}}{{legend|#ff1111|Non-signatory}}{{Col-end}}]]

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.&lt;ref name=Human&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. [[Niue]] and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=UNTC|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest state to become a party to the convention is South Sudan, on 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Article 2 (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, divorce, and family law===
Article 16 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] enshrines the right of consenting men and women to marry and found a family.&lt;ref name=Human /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 16 of CEDAW stipulates that, "1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations [...]".&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article16|title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the rights included are a woman's right to freely and consensually choose her spouse; to have parental rights to her children irrespective of her marital status; the right of a married woman to choose a profession or an occupation, and to have property rights within marriage. In addition to these, "The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect".&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

[[Polygamous marriage]] is a controversial practice, prevalent in some parts of the world. The General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, state at ''General Recommendation No. 21, Equality in marriage and family relations''
"14.[...] Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman's right to equality with men, and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm|title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cohabitation]] of unmarried couples as well as [[single mother]]s are common in some parts the world. The [[Human Rights Committee]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom28.htm|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|work=umn.edu|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"27. In giving effect to recognition of the family in the context of article 23, it is important to accept the concept of the various forms of family, including unmarried couples and their children and single parents and their children and to ensure the equal treatment of women in these contexts (General Comment 19 paragraph 2 last sentence). Single parent families frequently consist of a single woman caring for one or more children, and States parties should describe what measures of support are in place to enable her to discharge her parental functions on the basis of equality with a man in a similar position."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action===
{{main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, also known as VDPA, is a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. This declaration recognizes women's rights as being protected human rights. Paragraph 18 reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/Vienna.aspx |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ===
{{main|United Nations Security Council Resolution}}
On 31 October 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]], the first formal and legal document from the United Nations Security Council that requires all states to respect fully [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]] applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls during and after the [[armed conflicts]].

=== Maputo Protocol ===
{{main|Maputo Protocol}}
The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the [[Maputo Protocol]], was adopted by the [[African Union]] on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in [[Maputo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0307/S00279.htm African Union: Rights of Women Protocol Adopted], press release, [[Amnesty International]], 22 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozambique.

==Violence against women==

===United Nations Declaration===
The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the United Nations in 1993. It defines [[violence against women]] as "''any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|work=un-documents.net|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution established that women have a right to be free from violence. As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly declared the day of 25 November to be the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].

Article 2 of The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women outlines several forms of violence against women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article Two:
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:

:(a)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [[Battery (crime)|battering]], sexual abuse of female children in the household, [[dowry]]-related violence, [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]];
:(b)   Physical, sexual and [[psychological abuse|psychological violence]] occurring within the general community, including [[rape]], [[sexual abuse]], [[sexual harassment]] and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in women and [[forced prostitution]];
:(c)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Istanbul Convention===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape and sexual violence ===

{{main|Rape|War rape|Violence against women}}
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an assault by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] as well as a [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as a form of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

==== As genocide ====
{{main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu (Trial Judgement)'', ICTR-96-4-T, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), 2 September 1998, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,ICTR,,,40278fbb4,0.html p. 166] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012031344/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CICTR%2C%2C%2C40278fbb4%2C0.html |date=12 October 2012 }} ¶.733.

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the [[Wartime sexual violence|spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime.

==== As a crime against humanity ====
{{main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as a [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive&amp;nbsp;– A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also condemn systematic rape as well as murder, [[sexual slavery]], and forced pregnancy, as the "violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law." and require a particularly effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Section II, paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was first recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča|Foca]] (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture, and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.&lt;ref name="haverford"&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212122926/http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="haverford"/&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia and Herzegovina : Foca verdict&amp;nbsp;– rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907091105/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH |date=7 September 2009 }}. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foča|Foca]], eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt;

===Forced marriage and slavery===
The 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery]] defines "institutions and practices similar to slavery" to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SupplementaryConventionAbolitionOfSlavery.aspx |title=Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c) Any institution or practice whereby:
* (i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or
* (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
* (iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

The Istanbul Convention requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt;

===Trafficking Protocol===
The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the ''Trafficking Protocol'' or ''UN TIP Protocol'') is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the [[Convention against Transnational Organised Crime]]. It is one of the three [[Palermo protocols]]. Its purpose is defined at ''Article 2. Statement of purpose'' as: "(a) To prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; (b) To protect and assist the victims of such trafficking, with full respect for their human rights; and (c) To promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf |title=United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime And The Protocols Thereto |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
