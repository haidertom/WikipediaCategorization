'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the [[Atlanta]] underground for the 2015 mixtape ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'' before attaining nationwide attention following the [[Metro Boomin]] collaborative album ''[[Savage Mode]]'' (2016), its lead single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]", and his collaboration with Drake, "[[Sneakin']]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview|title=21 Savage chops it up with Seth Rogen|date=2018-04-26|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved his first number one single at the end of 2017 with his feature on [[Post Malone]]'s "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]."&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/post-malone-21-savage-rockstar-no-1-billboard-hot-100-chart/|title=Post Malone's ''Rockstar'' Hits No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=XXL Magazine|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he also released the [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]] and Metro Boomin collaboration ''[[Without Warning (21 Savage, Offset and Metro Boomin album)|Without Warning]]''.

==Early life==

In the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in the [[DeKalb County School District]] due to gun possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmVcwIyKo|title=21 Savage Interview With The Breakfast Club (8-4-16)|date=August 4, 2016|people=[[Charlamagne tha God]], [[DJ Envy]]|publisher=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to begin attending schools around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] before being sent to a youth detention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-21-savage-news.22853.html|title=Everything You Need To Know About 21 Savage|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was "exhausted" by.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/04/21-savage-the-breakfast-club-interview|title=21 Savage Talks Being An "A" Student, Losing His Best Friends On The Breakfast Club|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the [[Bloods]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]].

In 2017, his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', reached at number two on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7866158/21-savage-haim-billboard-200-albums-chart-top-10|title=21 Savage &amp; Haim Debut in Top 10 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lead single, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]", charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2017/08/08/hot-100-niall-horans-slow-hands-enters-top-15-21-savages-bank-account-top-20/|title=Hot 100: Niall Horan’s "Slow Hands" Enters Top 15, 21 Savage’s "Bank Account" Top 20|date=August 7, 2017|work=Headline Planet|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was featured on [[Post Malone]]'s single "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]", which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and broke several records.&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/post-malone-rockstar-breaks-spotify-global-record/|title=Post Malone Breaks Spotify Global Record With ''Rockstar'' - XXL|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031270/post-malone-rockstar-platinum-21-savage|title=Post Malone &amp; 21 Savage's 'Rockstar' Is Now Certified Platinum|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on [[Young Thug]]'s extended play ''[[Hear No Evil (Young Thug EP)|Hear No Evil]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/13/young-thug-hear-no-evil-nicki-minaj-21-savage|title=Young Thug drops Hear No Evil EP|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=April 13, 2018|website=The Fader|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he also appeared on the single "Outstanding" by [[SahBabii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/sahbabii-21-savage-new-song-outstanding/|title=Listen to SahBabii and 21 Savage's New Song "Outstanding"|last=India|first=Lindsey|date=April 20, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 21 he was featured on the single "Rover 2.0", which is part of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s [[Simi (mixtape)|Simi]] mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1988300/blocboy-jb-rover-2-0-feat-21-savage/music/|title=BlocBoy JB – "Rover 2.0" (Feat. 21 Savage)|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 23, 2018|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/05/blocboy-jb-simi-mixtape/|title=BlocBoy JB Drops 'Simi' Mixtape Featuring Drake, Lil Pump and More|last=Coleman II|first=C. Vernon|date=May 4, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, he was featured on [[Ty Dolla Sign]]'s "Clout", which is part of the upcoming deluxe edition of last years's ''[[Beach House 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Darville|first=Jordan|date=May 9, 2018|title=Ty Dolla $ign recruits 21 Savage for "Clout"|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/05/09/ty-dolla-sign-21-savage-clout|magazine=The Fader|location=New York City|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Called "one of the last street niggas left making music" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called "Guns Down, Paintballs Up" which was intended to reduce gun violence.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title="Paintball wars," initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as "well-intentioned, however, misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide "paintball wars"|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2" /&gt;

Controversy arose after Abraham-Joseph pulled out a firearm during a pool party on June 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8460380/21-savage-gun-atlanta-brawl|title=21 Savage Draws Gun During Atlanta Pool Party Brawl|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph was given the firearm by a friend after seeing an opposing crew member also pull out a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/21-savage-pull-out-a-gun/|title=21 Savage Pulls Out A Gun During A Brawl: Watch|date=2018-06-10|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samantha Davon James''' (born December 18, 1986), better known by her stage name '''3D Na'Tee''', is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, and video director. She was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and grew up in the [[3rd Ward of New Orleans|3rd Ward]]. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as [[MTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SuckaFree Freestyle: 3D Na'Tee|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Source (magazine)|The Source Magazine]],&lt;ref name="thesource"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SOURCE MAGAZINE: Top Up &amp; Coming Female Rapper Releases Her Latest Project|url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/235038/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XXL: Surviving The Times: Erick Sermon Talks About New Mixtape, Digital Label &amp; Reviving Skills|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2012/05/surviving-the-times-erick-sermon-talks-about-new-mixtape-digital-label-reviving-skills/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHAHEEM REID: 5 STAR REVIEW FROM XXL'S EDITOR-AT-LARGE SHAHEEM REID &amp; @TEAMSHAHEEM|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?p=1340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fader Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: Features 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/index.php?s=na%27tee&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; RapRadar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPRADAR: RapRadar Search Features|url=http://rapradar.com/?s=3D+na%27tee&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RapRehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPREHAB: RapRehab's Featured Artist|url=http://raprehab.com/2012/08/3d-natee-new-orleans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SMOKING SECTION: 3D Na'Tee is Back and we have been invited to her Coronation|url=http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2012/07/3d-natee-the-coronation-mixtape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOLA.COM: 4X Nola HipHop Award Winner 3D Na'Tee Raises The Bar Again By Being The First Native HipHop Artist With A Mobile App|url=http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/09/industry_influence_celebrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as "Playing the Dozens". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.

In 1999, she began recording with local label called '''Clientell Records'''. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the "Snypa Squad" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project '''"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva"''' followed by '''Volume 2''' in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on '''The Kush 2''' DVD which was produced by [[YMCMB]] president [[Mack Maine]]. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like [[Lil Wayne]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] as well as [[Curren$y]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]]

==Career==
After the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on '''The Kush 2''', she released her third mix tape '''Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown''' followed by a music video for a song she titled, '''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner'''. That video piqued the interest of [[G-Unit Records]] affiliate and [[Shade 45]] [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius XM]] radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to [[New York City|New York]] for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper [[50 Cent|50 Cents']] wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by [[Benzino]], former co-owner of [[The Source Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3DNATEE.COM: BIO|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?page_id=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee Explains How HipHop Saved Her Life, Talks Female Rap, and More|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.

'''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner''' (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFBEAT MAGAZINE: Nola HipHop Awards Nominees Finalized|url=http://www.offbeat.com/2010/10/14/nola-underground-hip-hop-award-nominees-finalized/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for '''Lyricist of the Year''', '''Mixtape of the Year''', and '''Female Artist of the Year'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHLEE NICOLE SPILLS: Winners of the 2010 HipHop Awards Announced|url=http://www.ashleenicolespills.com/2010/10/20/winners-of-the-2010-nola-underground-hip-hop-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixtape included collaborations from [[Curren$y]] (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), '''Ebony Eyez''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STL TODAY: Ebony Eyez Returns With A Story 2 Tell|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/ebony-eyez-returns-with-a-story-to-tell/article_6a65d3ae-d2bb-11e1-985c-0019bb30f31a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Babs Bunny''' (formally of [[Sean Combs|Sean "Diddy" Combs]]) founded group, [[Da Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYFFAL: Forming Da Band|url=http://www.syffal.com/making-the-band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALL MUSIC.COM: Da Band's Discography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/da-band-mn0000764981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on [[MTV|MTV's]] SuckerFree Freestyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SUCKERFREE FREESTYLE: 3DNATEE|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[DJ Envy]]. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called '''Go Head'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHAPSODY: Syleena Johnson|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/syleena-johnson/album/chapter-v-underrated/track/go-head-feat-natee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for '''Switch'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLDSTARHIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee's Switch|url=http://hp-www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video800.php?v=wshhd71614snrClf6d9H&amp;set_size=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer [[Timbaland]]. This video gained her a nomination for '''Director of the Year''' and an award for '''Video of the Year'''. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to [[The Hit Factory|Miami's Hit Factory Studio]] to work with her on her next project, The Coronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONWAX MAGAZINE: Rapper 3D Na'Tee shoots 'Wild' video in New Orleans, produced by Lex Luger|url=http://onwaxmagazine.com/owm/index.php/rapper-3d-natee-shoots-wild-video-in-new-orleans-produced-by-lex-luger/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company [[Mosley Music Group|Mosely Music Group]] and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via [[Twitter]] that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJSMALLZ.COM: INTERVIEW: SOUTHERN SMOKE TV! 3D NA'TEE (@3DNATEE) SPEAKS ON TURNING DOWN RECORD DEAL WITH TIMBALAND|url=http://www.djsmallz.com/blog/2012/5/18/interview-southern-smoke-tv-3d-natee-3dnatee-speaks-on-turni.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: [WOHH EXCLUSIVE]!|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album ''The Coronation'' which featured artists like [[Keri Hilson]], Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach Music Group's]] Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.

In August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled '''NO LOVE''' produced by [[Maybach Music Group|MMG's]] '''Young Shun''' was the #9 most requested song in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIRIUS XM: #9 Song in the Country|url=https://twitter.com/DontHateBeHated/status/235174781102747648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation's second release, '''Lil Kim''' produced by '''Casa Di''' gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] and [[The Fader]] Magazines' websites.&lt;ref name="thesource" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee Releases Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and "fell in love" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like [[Trina]], [[Missy Elliott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEBSTAGRAM: Trina Talks to 3D Na'Tee about 'Lil Kim|url=http://web.stagram.com/p/251601262639516075_14212753}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grammy Award Winning [[Chamillionaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIG DOOR: Chamillionaire|url=http://www.bigdoor.com/company/press/grammy-award-winning-artist-and-bigdoor-ceo-to-speak-at-gamification-summit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site [https://web.archive.org/web/20120802044043/http://www.chamillionaire.com/videos/play/608 www.chamillionaire.com].

As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the [[chokeslam]] on others with little provocation, which made him quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#over|popular]] with the crowd as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/24/pf-729421.html|title=SLAM!

On August 27, at the [[NWA World Title Tournament]], 911 participated in the [[ECW tournaments#NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tournament|namesake tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he defeated [[Doink the Clown]] in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed the year by defeating [[The Pitbulls]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] at [[Holiday Hell (1994)|Holiday Hell]]. Poling received the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[PWI Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.

'''Teng Fu-ju''' ({{zh|t=鄧福如|s=邓福如|p=Dèng Fúrú|first=t}}; born 20 June 1987), known by her [[stage name]] '''A-fu''' ({{zh|c=阿福|p=Ā fú}}), is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] singer and songwriter. Prior to her solo debut in the music scene, A-fu was a member of Lazy Bomb, an indie band, and a [[Demo (music)|demo]] singer. She is known for her [[cover version]] of "[[Nothin' on You]]" by [[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]], which drew wide attention on [[YouTube]] in 2010. In May 2011, A-fu released her debut studio album, ''That's How It Is'', for which she received a nomination for Best New Artist at the [[23rd Golden Melody Awards]].&lt;ref name="goldenmelody"/&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Hsinchu City]] on 20 June 1987, A-fu grew up in the countryside in [[Xiangshan District, Hsinchu|Xiangshan District]] and in [[Changhua County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/ENT6/7966023.shtml |title=菲船事件衝擊 阿福MV郵輪夢碎 |work=UDN |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=22 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619002332/http://udn.com/NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/ENT6/7966023.shtml |archivedate=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both her parents run a rental car business together, and as they were often busy with work when she was young, A-fu and her elder sister, Hsing Ju, spent much of their childhood under the care of their aunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20130730000847-260112 | title=阿福發夢穿越古羅馬 談情賞夜景 | work=China Times | date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, A-fu still maintains a close relationship with her mother and grew up influenced by her mother's love for music, in particular songs by [[Teresa Teng]]. At a young age, A-fu entered in singing and recitation competitions. Also, at her mother's request, she learned the standard Mandarin enunciation by watching the Taiwanese educational programme ''The Daily Characters'' (每日一字) hosted by news presenter Lee Yen-chiu, which perhaps, has shaped her distinctive vocals, in a way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.udn.com/hurt633/5230339 | title=美聲素人「阿福」- 征服9億人 | work=UDN | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended Kuang-Fu High School, a [[comprehensive high school]] in Hsinchu, and graduated from [[Shih Hsin University]] with a degree in public relations and advertising in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.shu.edu.tw/web/dp/a_pc/shut01_pc5.html |title=公共關係暨廣告學系 - 知名校友 |work=SHU |accessdate=22 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223044116/http://m.shu.edu.tw/web/dp/a_pc/shut01_pc5.html |archivedate=23 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Afu teng 2013aug31 resized.jpg|thumb|A-fu in 2013.]]

During her college years, A-fu was the lead singer of an indie band called Lazy Bomb. The band released a self-titled [[Extended play|EP]] in November 2007 and disbanded shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.5music.com.tw/CDList-C.asp?cdno=428475678514 | title=首張同名EP | work=5music | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, A-fu met music producer AL (何官錠), who is also a member and keyboard player of the pop rock band Six Plus (六甲樂團).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nownews.com/n/2010/10/12/633978 | title=神祕女「聲」爆紅！四十萬網友問何方神聖？ | work=NOWnews | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started collaborating with AL as a [[Demo (music)|demo]] singer. The first demo which she recorded, titled "Sheng Sheng Man" (聲聲慢), was chosen as the ending theme song for the first season of the Chinese TV series ''[[Justice Bao (2010 TV series)|Justice Bao]]''. The ''Zhong guo feng'' music style of the song, coupled with A-fu's crystal-clear voice and diction, generated considerable buzz among the Chinese netizens. Soon after, A-fu's singing caught the attention of veteran host [[Chang Hsiao-yen]], who later signed A-fu to her record label Forward Music. While awaiting the release of her debut album, A-fu garnered media attention after uploading her first video on [[YouTube]] in September 2010, her [[cover version]] of [[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]]'s "[[Nothin' on You]]", which had racked up more than a million views within a week. She followed with more covers of popular hits, which includes "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]",  "Qing Hua Ci" (青花瓷) by [[Jay Chou]], [[Bruno Mars]]'s "[[Just the Way You Are (Bruno Mars song)|Just the Way You Are]]" and so forth. In December 2010, A-fu was featured as a [[backup singer]] during Stella Chang's comeback concert in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="2011搜尋人氣大獎／最受歡迎新人歌手─鄧福如"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tw.celebrity.yahoo.com/news/2011%E6%90%9C%E5%B0%8B%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%A3%E5%A4%A7%E7%8D%8E-%E6%9C%80%E5%8F%97%E6%AD%A1%E8%BF%8E%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%BA%E6%AD%8C%E6%89%8B-%E9%84%A7%E7%A6%8F%E5%A6%82-035402599.html | title=2011搜尋人氣大獎／最受歡迎新人歌手─鄧福如 | work=Yahoo! | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">'''Acting under a description''' is a conception of the [[intentionality]] of human action introduced by philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].

==G. E. M. Anscombe==
Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question "Why?", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (''Intention'', par. 5-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gertrude |last=Anscombe |author-link=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Intention |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent can answer the "Why?" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. "To do Y" or "because I want to do Y" would be typical answers to this sort of "Why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Moreover, the act is known without observation (''Intention'', section. 28). For example, a person knows without observation that their hands are pushing upwards and when asked what they are doing, they say they are opening the window. Hence, in their hands pushing upwards, they are opening the window; opening a window being a description of the intentional act.

Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description "pumping water" but not under other descriptions such as "contracting these muscles", "tapping out this rhythm", etc.

==Ian Hacking==
The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by [[Ian Hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ian |last=Hacking |author-link=Ian Hacking |title=Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows: people talk about themselves as intentional beings. Descriptions of acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. A person offers an explanation of why he or she acts thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts.

Acting under a description has important implications for interpreting our selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and the kind of person that commits the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hacking |first=Ian |year= 2007 |title=Kinds of People: Moving Targets |periodical=PROCEEDINGS-BRITISH ACADEMY |volume=151 |pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Curran |first=R |year=1997 |title=HACKING, IAN. Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personalities and the Sciences of Memory |periodical=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=174–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer "to show who's boss", "because I have ADHD", or "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.

According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be.

Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. "In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever-shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lynch |first=M |year=1995 |title=Review Symposium on Ian Hacking: Narrative Hooks and Paper Trails: the Writing of Memory |periodical=History of the Human Sciences |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

'''Artificial creation''' is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis of complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.  

The field bears some similarity to [[artificial life]], but unlike artificial life, artificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures and processes of abiogenesis.  Artificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to optimize artificial creatures or grow synthetic life forms.  Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of interaction, initial conditions and  primordial building blocks that can generate complex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules of interaction.
   
An essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other related fields is that no explicit [[fitness function]] is used to select for fit structures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities that do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation studies the way in which complex [[emergent properties]] can arise to form a [[self-organizing system]].

==Origins==

Although concepts and elements of artificial creation are represented to some degree in many areas, the field itself is less than a decade old. There are models of self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties in [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other fields. Artificial creation differs from these in that it focuses on underlying properties of systems that can generate the endless environmentally interactive complexity of living systems.  

One of the primary impetuses for the exploration of artificial creation comes from the realization in the [[artificial life]] and [[evolutionary computing]] fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural [[evolution]].  These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems with the use of [[fitness functions]] for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2)  the process of [[self-replication]] used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of [[self-organizing systems]].

==Issues==

The concept of a [[fitness function]] (or [[objective function]]) is central to [[artificial life]] systems. The [[fitness function]] is used to drive a given [[artificial evolution]] process to create [[synthetic organisms]] capable of performing a given task.  However, [[fitness functions]], even aggregate high-level ones, drive evolving systems to particular solutions and place a ceiling on innovation and complexity.  Natural [[evolution]] does not drive organisms toward particular solutions to problems.  There is no motive force for [[evolution]] in our universe beyond that of adherence to physical law.  This is a subtle point: when modern organisms are viewed in a local context it does appear that they are evolving to optimize particular abilities that will help them survive.  This is not the case in a global sense.  In fact, the pressure to optimize a given ability comes from the current state of a given population.  The only fundamental selective pressure is the ability of structures to adhere to physical law.  [[Stochastic]] events initiated the appearance of features that we might view as adaptive traits, and it is the local evolution of these traits that much of evolutionary theory is based upon.  

The universe maintains its own consistency.  However, when trying to model the universe, or create [[artificial organisms]] by mimicking natural evolution, the application of [[fitness functions]] that select for particular abilities force an unnatural bias onto the evolving organisms. 

In [[evolutionary biology]], it is well understood that all properties of organisms and [[ecosystems]] are [[emergent properties]] of fundamental physical law. The conceptual problems related to generations, offspring and populations that occur in [[artificial life]] systems stem from the fact that self-replication is itself an innovation of life on Earth.  The dynamics observed in modern self-replicating life forms on Earth are extremely complex [[emergent properties]] of the organisms themselves, not driving forces imposed by an external controlling entity.

{{Buddhism}}
Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view.

Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Compassion ==
[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 011 The Buddha and Ananda tend a Sick Monk (9244516966).jpg|thumb|306x306px|The Buddha and Ananda tend a sick monk]]
[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality.

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

'''Codd's cellular automaton''' is a [[cellular automaton]] (CA) devised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Edgar F. Codd]] in 1968. It was designed to recreate the computation- and construction-universality of [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] but with fewer states: 8 instead of 29. Codd showed that it was possible to make a self-reproducing machine in his CA, in a similar way to von Neumann's [[von Neumann Universal Constructor|universal constructor]], but never gave a complete implementation.

==History==
In the 1940s and '50s, [[John von Neumann]] posed the following problem:&lt;ref name=vonNeumann66&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''|last=von Neumann|first=John|last2=Burks|first2=Arthur W.|year=1966|publisher=www.walenz.org|accessdate=2012-01-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html|archivedate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What kind of logical organization is sufficient for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?
He was able to construct a [[von Neumann cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] with 29 states, and with it a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]. Codd, building on von Neumann's work, found a simpler machine with eight states.&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author=Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modified von Neumann's question:
*What kind of logical organization is ''necessary'' for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?

Three years after Codd's work, Edwin Roger Banks showed a 4-state CA in his PhD thesis that was also capable of universal computation and construction, but again did not implement a self-reproducing machine.&lt;ref name=Banks1971&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Processing and Transmission in Cellular Automata|year=1971| first=Edwin| last=Banks|publisher=PhD thesis, MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering|url=http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/banks/banks_commentary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Devore, in his 1973 masters thesis, tweaked Codd's rules to greatly reduce the size of Codd's design, to the extent that it could be implemented in the computers of that time. However, the data tape for self-replication was too long; Devore's original design was later able to complete replication using [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. [[Christopher Langton]] made another tweak to Codd's cellular automaton in 1984 to create [[Langton's loops]], exhibiting self-replication with far fewer cells than that needed for self-reproduction in previous rules, at the cost of removing the ability for universal computation and construction.&lt;ref name=Langton84&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(84)90256-2|title=Self-Reproduction in Cellular Automata|author=Langton, C.

[[Image:Codd CA ConstructionArm.gif|right|frame|100px|The construction arm in Codd's CA can be moved into position using the commands listed in the text. Here the arm turns left, then right, then writes a cell before retracting along the same path.]]

Codd's CA has eight states determined by a [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. 

The table below shows the signal-trains needed to accomplish different tasks. Some of the signal trains need to be separated by two blanks (state 1) on the wire to avoid interference, so the 'extend' signal-train used in the image at the top appears here as '70116011'.

==Universal computer-constructor==

Codd designed a self-replicating computer in the cellular automaton, based on [[Wang B-machine|Wang's W-machine]]. However, the design was so colossal that it evaded implementation until 2009, when Tim Hutton constructed an explicit configuration.&lt;ref name=Hutton2010 /&gt; There were some minor errors in Codd's design, so Hutton's implementation differs slightly, in both the configuration and the ruleset.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R.

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consciousness after death''' is a common theme in [[society]] and [[culture]] in the context of [[Afterlife|life after death]].  [[Science|Scientific]] [[research]] has established that the [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the [[brain]], the cessation of which defines [[brain death]].

==Neuroscience==

[[Neuroscience]] is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the [[premise]] that all of [[behavior]] and all of the [[mental function|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the [[nervous system]], especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ.

There are multiple lines of [[scientific evidence|evidence]] that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.

* '''Neuroanatomical correlates''': In the field of [[neuroimaging]], [[neuroscientist]]s can use various [[functional neuroimaging]] methods to measure an aspect of brain function that correlates with a particular mental state or process.
* '''Experimental manipulations''': Neuroimaging (correlational) studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of mental processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]] and necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit [[Experiment|experimental manipulation]] of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes [[consciousness]], then a causal role for that brain activity can be [[Inference|inferred]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness|disorders of consciousness}}
Death is the cessation of all [[biological process|biological functions]] that sustain a living [[organism]]. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).&lt;ref name="enc bd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Brain-Death.html |title=Brain death| website=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| accessdate= 25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death?source=search_result&amp;search=brain+death&amp;selectedTitle=1~37 | title=Diagnosis of brain death| last=Young | first= G Bryan| website=UpToDate|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.53108| pmid = 19881172| title = The diagnosis of brain death| journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 7–11| year = 2009| last1 = Goila | first1 = A. | last2 = Pawar | first2 = M. | pmc = 2772257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4081/ni.2010.e2| pmid = 21577338| pmc = 3093212| title = Diagnosis of brain death| journal = Neurology International| volume = 2| issue = 1| year = 2010| last1 = Machado | first1 = C.| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Near-death experience (NDE)==
{{Main|Near-death experience}}
A near-death experience (NDE) is a [[personal experience]] associated with impending [[death]], encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a [[hallucination|hallucinatory state]] caused by various neurological factors such as [[cerebral anoxia]], [[Hypercapnia|hypercarbia]], abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Blanke, Sebastian Dieguez.

'''Death and adjustment hypotheses''' ('''DAH''') is a theory about death and dying that focuses on [[death anxiety (psychology)]] and adjustment to death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Theories on Death and Dying]'', McGraw-Hill, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.&lt;ref&gt;Md Zakaria Siddique, "A review of ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''", ''Death Studies'', vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). ''The Truth about Death and Dying''. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.

==Beginning==

The theory was first promoted in the book ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses'' in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, ''Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated'', was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal ''[[Death Studies]]'' and [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death—A Scientific Effort from the Islamic World. Death Studies, 33 (2), 190–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P. (2009). Book Reviewing by Dr. Peter Fenwick. Newsletter, 27, Spirituality and Special Interest Group. The Royal College of Psychiatrists. London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory itself as the short article ''Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' did the same in its article "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain. "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses". ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'', vol. 15, no. 4 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

Factors behind the DAH are described in ''European Psychiatry'', Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –

"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing
1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, &lt;br/&gt;
2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and &lt;br/&gt;
3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral
implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the "death adjustment hypotheses," would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology."

===Concept of death===

Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"&gt;Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death anxiety as a whole===

Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url=http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title=How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors=Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal=Open Nurs J. |year=2013 |volume=7 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid=23400515 |pmc=3565229 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from  [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of  dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt; DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential death anxiety===

It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism, immorality and judgment issues===
Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses==

As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon.
*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is "the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected".&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

[[File:Sudden Death graph.png|thumb|Illustration of the premature death trajectory. There is a sharp decline in human function in a short period of time.|205x205px]]
Dying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |title=Trajectory of Dying |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306060758/http://www.fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudden death trajectory==
Sudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and [[unnatural death|unexpectedly die]] without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like [[myocardial infarction]] or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.

==Chronic malady trajectory==
[[File:Length of Dying Process.png|thumb|A chronic malady trajectory showing an overall decline in health with intermittent rises and falls in human function.|left|187x187px]]The chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[HIV]] or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by [[Recrudescence|acute crises]] and intermittent [[Cure#Remission|recoveries]].&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil;&lt;ref name=one /&gt; the patient may eventually become [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|mentally]] and [[emotional exhaustion|emotionally exhausted]].

==Natural death trajectory==
[[File:Steady decline.png|thumb|A typical natural death trajectory chronicling a long, steady decline in health over time.]]
A natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to [[aging-associated diseases|old age]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolejs, Josef; Marešová, Petra. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268335/ "Onset of mortality increase with age and age trajectories of mortality from all diseases in the four Nordic countries"], ''[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerstorf|first1=Denis|last2=Ram|first2=Nilam|last3=Lindenberger|first3=Ulman|last4=Smith|first4=Jacqui|title=Age and time-to-death trajectories of change in indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related functions|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1805–1821|doi=10.1037/a0031340|pmid=23356526|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0024-EC54-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical care==
When someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide [[palliative care|palliative]] or comfort care.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life. Comfort care, or [[Hospice|hospice care]], is reserved for patients who acknowledge they will not be able to recover.

== The realism of the concept ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use [[artificial intelligence]], archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.com/?p=2717 US Government funds virtual reality research], bioethics.com, 14 June 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed [[Internet]] accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-immortality.org/whatis.html |title=What is Digital Immortality? |publisher=Digital-immortality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of [[Dmitry Itskov]]'s [[2045 Initiative]] is to "create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eördögh|first1=Fruzsina|title=Russian Billionaire Dmitry Itskov Plans on Becoming Immortal by 2045|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524041430/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Reaching digital immortality is a two-step process:
#  archiving and [[digitizing]] people,
#  making the avatar live

=== Archiving and digitizing people ===
According to [[Gordon Bell]] and [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] from [[Microsoft Research]], retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a [[terabyte]] of [[computer data storage|storage]] (for adequate quality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69927/tr-2000-101.pdf Digital Immortality], by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray, Microsoft Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=William Sims|title=Personality Capture and Emulation|date=November 2013|isbn=978-1-4471-5604-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=digital+immortality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[speech recognition|speech]] or [[optical character recognition|text recognition]] technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.

A second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.

Rothblatt envisions the creation of "mindfiles" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desat|first1=Marla|title=Would You Clone Your Mind to Live Forever?

Richard Grandmorin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/soon_immortal |title=soon immortal (@soon_immortal) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: "semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality".

Some find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.&lt;ref name="sterkul"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computertechnik und Sterbekultur|isbn=978-3-643-11071-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=caprica+digital+immortality|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuade|first1=Zan|title=What happens to us on the internet when we die?|url=https://theweek.com/articles/554466/what-happens-internet-when-die|publisher=The Week|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

Susanne Asche states:
{{pull quote|text=As a hopefully minimalistic definition then, digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person-centric repository containing a copy of everything that a person sees, hears, says, or engenders over his or her lifespan, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, movies, television shows, music albums/CDs, newspapers, documents, diaries and journals, interviews, meetings, love letters, notes, papers, art pieces, and so on, and so on; and if not everything, then at least as much as the person has and takes the time and trouble to include. The person’s personality, emotion profiles, thoughts, beliefs, and appearance are also captured and integrated into an artificially intelligent, interactive, con-versational agent/avatar. This avatar is placed in charge of (and perhaps "equated" with) the collected material in the repository so that the agent can present the illusion of having the factual memories, thoughts, and beliefs of the person him/herself.|author=Susanne Asche|source=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums, Digital Immortality &amp; Runaway Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asche|first1=Susanne|title=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums|date=23 April 2005|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|url=http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/3296701|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Making the avatar alive ===
{{unclear|date=March 2016}}

Defining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.

Rothblatt proposes the term "mindware" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's "mindfile" to generate a "mindclone." Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

=== Calibration process ===
During the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.
During this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59546">An '''epigenetic clock''' is a type of a [[Biomarkers of aging|molecular age estimation method]] based on [[DNA methylation]] levels. Pre-eminent examples for epigenetic clocks are '''[[Steve Horvath|Horvath]]'s clock''',&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; which applies to all human tissues/cells, and '''Hannum's clock''',&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which applies to blood.

==History==
The strong effects of age on DNA methylation levels have been known since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Berdyshev1967"/&gt; A vast literature describes sets of [[CpG site|CpGs]] whose DNA methylation levels correlate with age, e.g.&lt;ref name="Rakyan2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teschendorff2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell2012"/&gt; The first robust demonstration that DNA methylation levels in saliva could generate accurate age predictors was published by a [[UCLA]] team including [[Steve Horvath]] in 2011 (Bocklandt et al 2011).&lt;ref name="Bocklandt2011" /&gt; The labs of Trey Ideker and Kang Zhang at the [[University of California, San Diego]] published the Hannum epigenetic clock (Hannum 2013),&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which consisted of 71 markers that accurately estimate age based on blood methylation levels. 
The first multi-tissue epigenetic clock, Horvath's epigenetic clock, was developed by [[Steve Horvath]], a professor of [[human genetics]]  and of [[biostatistics]] at [[UCLA]] (Horvath 2013).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt; Horvath spent over 4 years collecting publicly available Illumina DNA methylation data and identifying suitable statistical methods.&lt;ref name="Biome2013"/&gt; The personal story behind the discovery was featured in Nature.&lt;ref name="Gibbs2014"/&gt; The age estimator was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. The major innovation of Horvath's epigenetic clock lies in its wide applicability: the same set of 353 CpGs and the same prediction algorithm is used irrespective of the DNA source within the organism, i.e. it does not require any adjustments or offsets.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; This property allows one to compare the ages of different areas of the human body using the same aging clock.

==Relationship to a cause of biological aging==
It is not yet known what exactly is measured by DNA methylation age. Horvath hypothesized that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system but details are unknown. The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christiansen2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"/&gt; strongly suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=DNA methylation-based measures of biological age: meta-analysis predicting time to death|url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/101020|journal=Aging|volume=8|pages=1844–1865|doi=10.18632/aging.101020|pmc=5076441|pmid=27690265|via=|doi-access=Free|vauthors=Chen B, Marioni R, Colicino E, Peters M, Ward-Caviness C, Tsai P, Roetker N, Just A, Demerath E, Guan W|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that the 353 clock CpGs are special or play a direct causal role in the aging process.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Rather, the epigenetic clock captures an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of the epigenome.

===Epigenetic clock theory of aging===
Horvath and Raj &lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"/&gt; proposed an epigenetic clock theory of aging with the following tenets:
* Biological aging results as an unintended consequence of both developmental programs and maintenance program, the molecular footprints of which give rise to DNA methylation age estimators. 
* The precise mechanisms linking the innate molecular processes (underlying DNAm age) to the decline in tissue function probably relate to both intracellular changes (leading to a loss of cellular identity) and subtle changes in cell composition, for example, fully functioning somatic stem cells. 
* At the molecular level, DNAm age is a proximal readout of a collection of innate aging processes that conspire with other, independent root causes of ageing to the detriment of tissue function.

==Motivation for biological clocks==
In general, biological aging clocks and [[biomarkers of aging]]  are expected to find many uses in biological research since age is a fundamental characteristic of most [[organisms]]. Accurate measures of biological age ('''biological aging clocks''') could be useful for
* testing the validity of various [[theories of biological aging]],
* diagnosing various age related [[disease]]s and for defining [[cancer]] subtypes,
* predicting/prognosticating  the onset of various diseases,
* serving as [[surrogate marker]]s for evaluating therapeutic interventions including  [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]  approaches,
* studying [[developmental biology]] and [[cell differentiation]],
* [[forensic]] applications, for example to estimate the age of a suspect based on blood left on a crime scene.
Overall, biological clocks are expected to be useful for studying what causes aging and what can be done against it.

==Properties of Horvath's clock==
The clock is defined as an age estimation method based on 353 [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] markers on the DNA. The 353 markers measure [[DNA methylation]] of [[CpG dinucleotide]]s. Estimated age ("predicted age" in mathematical usage), also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s; second, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues (which are used as human analogs for biological testing purposes). Organismal growth (and concomitant cell division) leads to a high ticking rate of the epigenetic clock that slows down to a constant ticking rate (linear dependence) after adulthood (age 20).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;
The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life even after adjusting for known risk factors &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt; suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging. Similarly, markers of physical and mental fitness are associated with the epigenetic clock (lower abilities associated with age acceleration).&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt;

Salient features of Horvath's epigenetic clock include its high accuracy and its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Since it allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same subject, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of accelerated age due to disease.

===Statistical approach===
The basic approach is to form a weighted average of the 353 clock CpGs, which is then transformed to DNAm age using a calibration function. The calibration function reveals that the epigenetic clock has a high ticking rate until adulthood, after which it slows to a constant ticking rate. Using the training data sets, Horvath used a penalized regression model ([[Elastic net regularization]]) to regress a calibrated version of chronological age on 21,369 CpG probes that were present both on the Illumina 450K and 27K platform and had fewer than 10 missing values. DNAm age is defined as estimated ("predicted") age. The elastic net predictor automatically selected 353 CpGs. 193 of the 353 CpGs correlate positively with age while the remaining 160 CpGs correlate negatively with age. R software and a freely available web-based tool can be found  at the following webpage.&lt;ref name="DNAmAgeSoftware"/&gt;

===Accuracy===
The median error of estimated age is 3.6 years across a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types
.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;  The epigenetic clock performs well in heterogeneous tissues (for example, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cerebellar samples, occipital cortex, buccal epithelium, colon, adipose, kidney, liver, lung, saliva, uterine cervix, epidermis, muscle) as well as in individual cell types such as CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, glial cells, neurons, immortalized B cells, mesenchymal stromal cells.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; However, accuracy depends to some extent on the source of the DNA.

=== Comparison with other biological clocks ===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
The epigenetic clock leads to a chronological age prediction that has a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] of r=0.96 with chronological age (Figure 2 in &lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;). Thus the age correlation is close to its maximum possible correlation value of 1.  Other biological clocks are based on a) [[telomere]] length, b) [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels (also known as INK4a/ARF locus),&lt;ref name="Collado2007"/&gt; and c) [[microsatellite]] mutations.&lt;ref name="Forster2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forster | first1 = P | last2 = Hohoff | first2 = C | last3 = Dunkelmann | first3 = B | last4 = Schürenkamp | first4 = M | last5 = Pfeiffer | first5 = H | last6 = Neuhuber | first6 = F | last7 = Brinkmann | first7 = B | year = 2015 | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1803/20142898.long | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 282 | issue = | page = 20142898 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 | pmid=25694621 | pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between chronological age and [[telomere]] length is r=−0.51 in women and r=−0.55 in men.&lt;ref name="Nordfjall2010"/&gt; The correlation between chronological age and expression levels of [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] in T cells is r=0.56.&lt;ref name="Wang2012"/&gt; {{citation needed span|text=[[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels only relate to age in [[T cell]]s, a type of white blood cells.|date=December 2016}} {{citation needed span|text=The microsatellite clock measures not chronological age but age in terms of elapsed cell divisions within a tissue.|date=December 2016}}

==Applications of Horvath's clock==
By contrasting DNA methylation age (estimated age) with chronological age, one can define measures of age acceleration. Age acceleration can be defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age. Alternatively, it can be defined as the residual that results from regressing DNAm age on chronological age. The latter measure is attractive because it does not correlate with chronological age.
A positive/negative value of epigenetic age acceleration suggests that the underlying tissue ages faster/slower than expected.

===Genetic studies of epigenetic age acceleration===
The broad sense heritability (defined via [[Falconer's formula]]) of age acceleration of blood from older subjects is around 40% but it appears to be much higher in newborns.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
Similarly, the age acceleration of brain tissue (prefrontal cortex) was found to be 41% in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Levine2015"/&gt;
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of epigenetic age acceleration in postmortem brain samples have identified
several [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] at a genomewide significance level.&lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu2017"/&gt;
GWAS of age acceleration in blood have identified several genome-wide significant genetic loci including the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus
.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"&gt;Lu AT., &amp; Xue L., &amp; Chen BH., et al., Horvath S. (2018). [

GWAS of epigenetic aging rates in blood reveals a critical role for TERT]. Nat Comm{{ doi|10.1038/s41467-017-02697-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in TERT gene paradoxically confer higher epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"/&gt;

===Lifestyle factors===
In general, lifestyle factors have only weak effects on epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"&gt;Quach A., &amp; Levine ME., &amp; Tanaka T.,…., &amp; Horvath S. (2018). [

Epigenetic clock analysis of diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle factors.]. Aging (Albany NY){{ doi|
10.18632/aging.101168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, cross sectional studies of extrinsic epigenetic aging rates in blood confirm the conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of education, eating a high plant diet with lean meats, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity and the risks associated with [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic syndrome]].

===Obesity and metabolic syndrome===
The epigenetic clock was used to study the relationship between high [[body mass index]] (BMI) and the DNA methylation ages of human blood, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2014obesity"/&gt; A significant correlation (r=0.42) between BMI and epigenetic age acceleration could be observed for the liver. A much larger sample size (n=4200 blood samples) revealed a weak but statistically significant correlation (r=0.09) between BMI and intrinsic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; The same large study found that various biomarkers of [[metabolic syndrome]] (glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]) were associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; Conversely, high levels of the good cholesterol [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] were associated with a lower epigenetic aging rate of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt;

DNAm age is higher than chronological age in female breast tissue that is adjacent to breast cancer tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Since normal tissue which is adjacent to other cancer types does not exhibit a similar age acceleration effect, this finding suggests that normal female breast tissue ages faster than other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Similarly, normal breast tissue samples from women without cancer have been found to be substantially older than blood samples collected from the same women at the same time {{PMID|28364215}}.

===Cancer tissue===
Cancer tissues show both positive and negative age acceleration effects. For most tumor types, no significant relationship can be observed between age acceleration and tumor morphology (grade/stage).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt; On average, cancer tissues with mutated [[P53|TP53]] have a lower age acceleration than those without it.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Further, cancer tissues  with high age acceleration tend to have fewer somatic mutations than those with low age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;
Age acceleration is highly related to various genomic aberrations in cancer tissues. Somatic mutations in [[estrogen receptor]]s or [[progesterone receptor]]s are associated with accelerated DNAm age in breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Colorectal cancer samples with a [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] (V600E) mutation or promoter hypermethylation of the mismatch repair gene [[MLH1]] are associated with an increased age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Age acceleration in [[glioblastoma multiforme]] samples is highly significantly associated with certain mutations in [[H3F3A]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
One study suggests that the epigenetic age of blood tissue may be prognostic of lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name="Levine2015lungcancer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = M  | date = 2015 | title = DNA methylation age of blood predicts future onset of lung cancer in the women's health initiative.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n9/full/100809.html | journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = | pages =690–700| pmid= 26411804 | pmc=4600626 | doi=10.18632/aging.100809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)===
[[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome (DS)]] entails an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age. The clinical manifestations of accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis has been sparse. According to the epigenetic clock, trisomy 21 significantly increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome"/&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease related neuropathology===
Epigenetic age acceleration of the human prefrontal cortex was found to be correlated with several neuropathological measurements that play a role in Alzheimer's disease &lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;  Further, it was found to be associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning, and memory functioning among individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;
The epigenetic age of '''blood''' relates to cognitive functioning in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt; Overall, these results strongly suggest that the epigenetic clock lends itself for measuring the biological age of the brain.

===Cerebellum ages slowly===
It has been difficult to identify tissues that seem to evade aging due to the lack of biomarkers of tissue age that allow one to contrast compare the ages of different tissues. An application of epigenetic clock to 30 anatomic sites from six centenarians and younger subjects revealed that the [[cerebellum]] ages slowly: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; This finding might explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. In younger subjects (e.g. younger than 70), brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; Several SNPs and genes have been identified that relate to the epigenetic age of the cerebellum &lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;

===Huntington's disease===
[[Huntington's disease]] has been found to increase the epigenetic aging rates of several human brain regions.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016HD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2016 | title = Huntington's disease accelerates epigenetic aging of human brain and disrupts DNA methylation levels

===Centenarians age slowly===
The offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in blood) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| url =

===HIV infection===
Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ([[HIV]]) is associated with clinical symptoms of accelerated aging, as evidenced by increased incidence and diversity of age-related illnesses at relatively young ages. But it has been difficult to detect an accelerated aging effect on a molecular level. An epigenetic clock analysis of human DNA from HIV+ subjects and controls detected a significant age acceleration effect in brain (7.4 years) and blood (5.2 years) tissue due to HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015HIV"/&gt; These results are consistent with an independent study that also found an age advancement of 5 years in blood of HIV patients and a strong effect of the HLA locus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Andrew M.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Philipp A.|last3=Kreisberg|first3=Jason F.|last4=Licon|first4=Katherine|last5=Jepsen|first5=Kristen L.|last6=Khosroheidari|first6=Mahdieh|last7=Morsey|first7=Brenda M.|last8=Swindells|first8=Susan|last9=Shen|first9=Hui|date= 2016-04-21|title=Methylome-wide Analysis of Chronic HIV Infection Reveals Five-Year Increase in Biological Age and Epigenetic Targeting of HLA|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.03.019|issn=1097-4164|pmc=4995115|pmid=27105112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
A large-scale study suggests that the blood of Parkinson's disease subjects exhibits (relatively weak) accelerated aging effects.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =| pages =  1130–42| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental disorder: syndrome X===
Children with a very rare disorder known as [[Brooke Greenberg|syndrome X]] maintain the façade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood. Since the physical development of these children is dramatically delayed, these children appear to be a toddler or at best a preschooler. According to an epigenetic clock analysis, blood tissue from syndrome X cases is not younger than expected.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015syndromeX"/&gt;

===Menopause accelerates epigenetic aging===
The following results strongly suggest that the loss of female hormones resulting from menopause accelerates the epigenetic aging rate of blood and possibly that of other tissues.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; First, early [[menopause]] has been found to be associated with an increased epigenetic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Second, surgical menopause (due to bilateral
[[oophorectomy]]) is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood and saliva. Third, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone therapy]], which mitigates hormonal loss, is associated with a negative age acceleration of buccal cells (but not of blood cells).&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Fourth, genetic markers that are associated with early menopause are also associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt;

===Cellular senescence versus epigenetic aging===
A confounding aspect of biological aging is the nature and role of senescent cells. It is unclear whether the three major types of cellular senescence, namely replicative senescence, oncogene-induced senescence and DNA damage-induced senescence are descriptions of the same phenomenon instigated by different sources, or if each of these is distinct, and how they are associated with epigenetic aging.
Induction of replicative senescence (RS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) were found to be accompanied by epigenetic aging of primary cells but senescence induced by DNA damage was not, even though RS and OIS activate the cellular DNA damage response pathway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 =D | year = 2016 | title = Epigenetic clock analyses of cellular senescence and ageing. | url =

Consistent with this, telomerase-immortalised cells continued to age (according to the epigenetic clock) without having been treated with any senescence inducers or DNA-damaging agents, re-affirming the independence of the process of epigenetic ageing from telomeres, cellular senescence, and the DNA damage response pathway.
Although the uncoupling of senescence from cellular aging appears at first sight to be inconsistent with the fact that senescent cells contribute to the physical manifestation of organism ageing, as demonstrated by Baker et al., where removal of senescent cells slowed down aging.&lt;ref name="Baker2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 =DJ | year = 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders. | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10600.html
| journal = Nature | volume=479| issue =7372| pages = 232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600| pmid= 22048312  | pmc=3468323}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the epigenetic clock analysis of senescence suggests that cellular senescence is a state that cells are forced into as a result of external pressures such as DNA damage, ectopic oncogene expression and exhaustive proliferation of cells to replenish those eliminated by external/environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt; These senescent cells, in sufficient numbers, will probably cause the deterioration of tissues, which is interpreted as organism ageing. However, at the cellular level, aging, as measured by the epigenetic clock, is distinct from senescence. It is an intrinsic mechanism that exists from the birth of the cell and continues. This implies that if cells are not shunted into senescence by the external pressures described above, they would still continue to age. This is consistent with the fact that mice with naturally long telomeres still age and eventually die even though their telomere lengths are far longer than the critical limit, and they age prematurely when their telomeres are forcibly shortened, due to replicative senescence. Therefore, cellular senescence is a route by which cells exit prematurely from the natural course of cellular aging.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt;

===Effect of sex and race/ethnicity===
Men age faster than women according to epigenetic age acceleration in blood, brain, saliva, and many other tissues.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = An epigenetic clock analysis of race/ethnicity, sex, and coronary heart disease.| journal = [[Genome Biol]]| volume =17  | issue = 1| year = 2016| pmid = 27511193  |pmc= 4980791|vauthors= Horvath S, Gurven M, Levine ME, Trumble BC, Kaplan H, Allayee H, Ritz BR, Chen B, Lu AT, Rickabaugh TM, Jamieson BD, Sun D, Li S, Chen W, Quintana-Murci L, Fagny M, Kobor MS, Tsao PS, Reiner AP, Edlefsen KL, Absher D, Assimes TL | doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1030-0| pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The epignetic clock method applies to all examined racial/ethnic groups in the sense that DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age. But ethnicity can be associated with epigenetic age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt; For example, the blood of Hispanics and the [[Tsimané people|Tsimané]] ages more slowly than that of other populations which might explain the [[Hispanic paradox|Hispanic mortality paradox]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt;

===Rejuvenation effect due to stem cell transplantation in blood===
[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], which transplants these cells from a young donor to an older recipient, rejuvenates the epigenetic age of blood to that of the donor {{PMID| 28550187}}. However, [[graft-versus-host disease]] is associated with increased DNA methyhlation age {{PMID| 28550187}}.

===Progeria===
Adult progeria also known as [[Werner syndrome]] is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Maierhofer2017Werner"/&gt;
Fibroblast samples from childen with Hutchinson-Gilford [[Progeria]] exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the "skin &amp; blood" epigenetic clock but not according to the original pan tissue clock from Horvath.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2018HGP"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Epigenetic clock for skin and blood cells applied to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome and ''ex vivo'' studies |journal=[[Aging (Albany NY)]] |volume=10 |issue=7 |year=2018 |pmid=30048243  |pmc=6075434|vauthors= Horvath S, Oshima J, Martin GM, Lu AT, Quach A, Cohen H, Felton S, Matsuyama M, Lowe D, Kabacik S, Wilson JG, Reiner AP, Maierhofer A, Flunkert J, Aviv A, Hou L, Baccarelli AA, Li Y, Stewart JD, Whitsel EA, Ferrucci L, Matsuyama S, Raj K |doi=10.18632/aging.101508 |doi-access=free |pages=1758–1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock==
Despite the fact that biomarkers of ageing based on DNA methylation data have enabled accurate age estimates for any tissue across the entire life course, the precise biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"&gt;Horvath, S., &amp; Raj, K. (2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0004-3  DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing]. Nature Reviews Genetics, {{doi|10.1038/s41576-018-0004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, epigenetic biomarkers may help to address long-standing questions in many fields, including the central question: why do we age?  The following explanations have been proposed in the literature.

===Possible explanation 1: Epigenomic maintenance system===
Horvath hypothesized that his clock arises from a methylation footprint left by an epigenomic maintenance system.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;

===Possible explanation 2: Unrepaired DNA damages===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Endogenous DNA damages occur frequently including about 50 double-strand DNA breaks per cell cycle&lt;ref name="pmid14566050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vilenchik MM, Knudson AG |title=Endogenous DNA double-strand breaks: production, fidelity of repair, and induction of cancer |journal=Proc.

Accumulation of epigenetic alterations may parallel the accumulation of un-repaired DNA damages that are proposed to cause aging (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

==Other age estimators based on DNA methylation levels==
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Several other age estimators have been described in the literature.

1) Weidner et al. (2014) describe an age estimator for DNA from blood that uses only three CpG sites of genes hardly affected by aging (cg25809905 in integrin, alpha 2b (ITGA2B); cg02228185 in aspartoacylase (ASPA) and cg17861230 in phosphodiesterase 4C, cAMP specific (PDE4C)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weidner | first1 = C. I. | last2 = Lin | first2 = Q. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Eisele | first4 = L. | last5 = Beier | first5 = F. | last6 = Ziegler | first6 = P. | last7 = Wagner | first7 = W. | year = 2014 | title = Aging of blood can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at just three CpG sites | url = http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/2/R24 | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2| page = R24 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r24 | pmid=24490752 | pmc=4053864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The age estimator by Weidener et al. (2014) applies only to blood. Even in blood this sparse estimator is far less accurate than Horvath's epigenetic clock (Horvath 2014) when applied to data generated by the Illumina 27K or 450K platforms.

&lt;/ref&gt; But the sparse estimator was developed for pyrosequencing data and is highly cost effective.

&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Hannum et al. (2013) &lt;ref name="Hannum2013"/&gt; report several age estimators: one for each tissue type. Each of these estimators requires covariate information (e.g. gender, body mass index, batch). The authors mention that each tissue led to a clear linear offset (intercept and slope). Therefore, the authors had to adjust the blood-based age estimator for each tissue type using a linear model. When the Hannum estimator is applied to other tissues, it leads to a high error (due to poor calibration) as can be seen from Figure 4A in Hannum et al. (2013). Hannum et al. adjusted their blood-based age estimator (by adjusting the slope and the intercept term) in order to apply it to other tissue types. Since this adjustment step removes differences between tissue, the blood-based estimator from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different tissues/organs. In contrast, a salient characteristic of the epigenetic clock  is that one does not have to carry out such a calibration step:&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; it always uses the same CpGs and the same coefficient values. Therefore, Horvath's epigenetic clock can be used to compare the ages of different tissues/cells/organs from the same individual. While the age estimators from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different normal tissues, they can be used to compare the age of a cancerous tissue with that of a corresponding normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Hannum et al. reported pronounced age acceleration effects in all cancers. In contrast, Horvath's epigenetic clock &lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R115/comments Horvath S (2013-11-04 11:00) Erratum in cancer tissues  Reader Comment]
&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that some cancer types (e.g. triple negative breast cancers or uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) exhibit negative age acceleration, i.e. cancer tissue can be much younger than expected.
An important difference relates to additional covariates. Hannum's age estimators make use of covariates such as gender, body mass index, diabetes status, ethnicity, and batch. Since new data involve different batches, one cannot apply it directly to new data. However, the authors present coefficient values for their CpGs in Supplementary Tables which can be used to define an aggregate measure that tends to be strongly correlated with chronological age but may be poorly calibrated (i.e. lead to high errors).

3.) Giuliani et al. identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in human teeth.

They found that mice treated with lifespan-extending interventions (surch as calorie restriction or dietary rapamycin) were significantly younger in epigenetic age than their untreated, wild-type age-matched controls. Mice age predictors also detects the longevity effects of gene knockouts, and rejuvenation of fibroblast-derived iPSCs.

Mice multi-tissue age predictor based on DNA methylation at 329 unique CpG sites reached a median absolute error of less than 4 weeks (~5% of lifespan). 
An attempt to use the human clock sites in mouse for age predictions showed that human clock  is not fully conserved in mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, T. M., Bonder, M. J., Stark, A.

'''''Future Evolution''''' is a book written by [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and illustrated by [[Alexis Rockman]]. He addresses his own opinion of [[future]] [[evolution]] and compares it with [[Dougal Dixon]]'s ''[[After Man: A Zoology of the Future]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]''.

According to Ward, humanity may exist for a long time. Nevertheless, we are impacting our world. He splits his book in different chronologies, starting with the near future (the next 1,000 years). Humanity would be struggling to support a massive [[human population|population]] of 11 billion. [[Global warming]] raises sea levels. The [[ozone]] layer weakens. Most of the available [[land (economics)|land]] is devoted to [[agriculture]] due to the demand for [[food]]. Despite all this, the [[Marine ecosystem|oceanic wildlife]] remains untethered by most of these impacts, specifically the [[fish farming|commercial farmed fish]]. This is, according to Ward, an era of [[extinction]] that would last about 10 million years (note that many [[Holocene extinction|human-caused extinctions]] have already occurred). After that, the world gets stranger.

Ward labels the species that have the potential to survive in a human-infested world. These include [[dandelion]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[owl]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[rat]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[crow]]s to name but a few. In the human-infested [[ecosystem]], those preadapted to live amongst man survived and prospered. Ward describes [[garbage dump]]s in the future infested with multiple species of rats, a snake with a sticky frog-like tongue to snap up rodents, and pigs with snouts specialized for rooting through garbage. The story's time traveller who views this new refuse-covered habitat is gruesomely attacked by ravenous flesh-eating crows.

Ward then questions the potential for humanity to evolve into a new species. According to him, this is incredibly unlikely. For this to happen a human population must isolate itself and [[interbreed]] until it becomes a new species. Then he questions if humanity would survive or extinguish itself by [[climate change]], [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[disease]], or the posing threat of [[nanotechnology]] as terrorist weapons.

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;

Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders. People appear to engage in targeted and specific reparatory behaviors toward the persons they wronged or offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guilty Feelings, Targeted Actions|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/5/607|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 22337764|pages = 607–618|volume = 38|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0146167211435796|language = en|first = Cynthia E.|last = Cryder|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Springer|first3 = Carey K.|last3 = Morewedge|pmc=4886498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11. Psychopathy and the Five-Factor Model of Personality, Widiger and Lynam |title=Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=173–7 |isbn=1-57230-864-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;!--Check Edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A person with psychopathy has a tendency to be harmful to his or herself and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

'''Hicham Aâboubou''' (born May 19, 1978)&lt;ref name="scway"/&gt; is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[association football|footballer]] who last played for [[Montreal Impact]] in the [[North American Soccer League (2011)|North American Soccer League]].

==Career==

===Africa===
Aâboubou started his soccer career with [[Khenifra]] playing with the junior team from 1992 to 1994. In 1994, he joined [[Kawkab Marrakech]], initially playing with the junior team, before eventually graduating through the senior A team, where he would play until 2001. He played for [[Mouloudia Oujda]], in 2001-2002, before being transferred back to [[Kawkab Marrakech]]. From 2002 to 2006 he played with KACM A Team, scoring two goals in 48 games.

===North America===
In 2006 Aâboubou joined Canadian team [[Laval Dynamites]], and scored two goals in 13 games in his debut season with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.attakfc.com/fr/joueurs/view/22 |title=Attak FC |date=2008-05-26 |access-date=2017-05-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526174630/http://www.attakfc.com/fr/joueurs/view/22 |archivedate=2008-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31 he joined [[Montreal Impact]], but did not play a single game in his first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soccerstats.us/bios/hicham-aaboubou/|title=Hicham Aâboubou {{!}} SoccerStats.us|website=soccerstats.us|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the team on April 21, 2007 against the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]], but was released by Montreal in February 2008. During the 2007 season he was loaned to the Impact's farm team [[Trois-Rivières Attak]] of the [[Canadian Soccer League]]. He managed to win some silverware with the Attak by winning the [[Open Canada Cup]], where he featured in the finals match against [[Columbus Clan F.C.]] which resulted in a 3-0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com/reports07/07csl114.htm|title = Result of the Monday September 3, 2007 CSL Open Canada Cup Final between Columbus Clan and Trois-Rivieres Attak played at Cove Road in London at 4:00pm.|date = September 3, 2007|accessdate = |website = Rocket Robin's Home Page|publisher = |last = Glover|first = Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2008 Aâboubou announced he would take a sabbatical from professional soccer, intending to return to study at Arts of Science at [[Université de Montréal]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150708/http://www.carabins.umontreal.ca/pages/Sports/soccer-masculin/athletes.aspx?lang=FR-CA&amp;pro=49123&amp;spt=7 Profile Université de Montréal]&lt;/ref&gt; while playing [[college soccer]] for the university's [[Montréal Carabins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabins.umontreal.ca/pages/nouvelles.aspx?lang=FR-CA&amp;nouvelle=422 Hicham Aaboubou, de l’Impact aux Carabins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212104631/http://www.carabins.umontreal.ca/pages/nouvelles.aspx?lang=FR-CA&amp;nouvelle=422 |date=December 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2009 the Montreal Impact signed Aâboubou to a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montrealimpact.com/News/News.aspx?language=EN&amp;ArticleID=1204&amp;Focus=0 |title=DEFENDER HICHAM AABOUBOU BACK WITH THE IMPACT |last=Vallée |first=Patrick |date=2009-08-05 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805081955/http://www.montrealimpact.com/News/News.aspx?language=EN&amp;ArticleID=1204&amp;Focus=0 |archive-date=2009-08-05 |dead-url=bot: unknown |access-date=2017-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance of the season on August 1 against [[Miami FC (2006)|Miami FC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealimpact.com/News/News.aspx?language=EN&amp;ArticleID=1207&amp;Focus=0 IMPACT 1 MIAMI 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926044910/http://www.montrealimpact.com/News/News.aspx?language=EN |date=2009-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 season Aâboubou helped the Impact clinch a playoff spot by finishing fifth in the standings. In the playoffs, he helped the Impact reach the USL finals against the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986–2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps FC]], the match was noted for the first time in USL history where the final match would consist of two Canadian clubs. The Impact would eventually defeat the Whitecaps on 6-3 aggregate on goals, and therefore claim their third USL Championship.

'''''How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life''''' is a 2012 popular [[economics]] book by [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]] and Edward Skidelsky. It was published initially by [[Other Press]] and later by [[Penguin Books]].

The book asks why Westerners work so many hours per week and lead lives that revolve around money, business and financial decisions in defiance of [[John Maynard Keynes]]' 1930 assertion&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University]] http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that there would come a time (around 2015) when [[capitalism]] would be able to provide for all our needs and the work week would drop to 10 or even 5 hours.

The book (and Edward Skidelsky's writing generally&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/23/consumerism-good-life-economic-system&lt;/ref&gt;) looks into the idea of [[Eudaimonia|the good life]] and how capitalism may have been the key to it, but we have now lost sense of the good life as a priority.

The solutions offered to this problem are to "curb insatiability" and to consider a form of [[basic income]] for society.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Escapologist]] http://newescapologist.co.uk/2012/12/06/how-much-is-enough/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"The over-all thrust of their polemic is a welcome call to reinvigorate society's ethical aspect and bring about the good life for everyone." —''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Yorker]] http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2012/08/13/120813crbn_brieflynoted1&lt;/ref&gt;

"How Much Is Enough? is a delightful book. It addresses a Big Question without the jargon and obfuscation that pollutes so much philosophy. The prose is lucid, and all the relevant issues are raised and addressed." —''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444450004578002083763099910&lt;/ref&gt;

"The authors turn to historical fiction, philosophy, and political theory, drawing on Faust, Marx's critique of capitalism, and Aristotle's uses of wealth. Their conclusion that concepts like respect, friendship, and community are more likely to contribute to satisfaction and overall happiness than wealth makes for a fascinating, if cerebral, read."  —''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59051-507-5&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Skidelskys move seamlessly from the abstract to the concrete; from philosophy to public policy." —''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Independent https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-the-week-how-much-is-enough-the-love-of-money-and-the-case-for-the-good-life-by-robert-skidelsky--edward-skidelsky-7917722.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', disagreed with both the book's concept of leisure and its proposition that more leisure time would lead to overall personal betterment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Working 9 to 12 ‘How Much Is Enough?’ by Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/how-much-is-enough-by-robert-skidelsky-and-edward-skidelsky.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=NY Times|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fountain of Eternal Life crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Fountain of Eternal Life]]'' in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."&lt;ref name="GVCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=Greater Cleveland Veteran's Memorial, Inc. |date=2003 |author=Marshall Fredericks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Alchemy==

{{See also|Elixir of life|Philosopher's stone}}

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms}}

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [[PLoS Biology]] paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/08/01/54/PDF/stewart_Plos.pdf|title= Aging and Death in an Organism That Reproduces by Morphologically Symmetric Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524855.800-bacteria-death-reduces-human-hopes-of-immortality.html |title=Bacteria Death Reduces Human Hopes of Immortality |date=February 5, 2005 |website=New Scientist magazine, issue 2485, page 19 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{cite web |url=http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212036/http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }} About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis, Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. {{cite web|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
{{Main|Digital immortality}}

==Religious views==
{{Main|Afterlife|Soul}}
As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Taoism===
{{See also|Chinese alchemy|Taoism and death|Xian (Taoism)}}

It is repeatedly stated in [[Lüshi Chunqiu]] that death is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=Herrlee G.|title=What is Taoism? : and other studies in Chinese cultural history|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226120478|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Maspero]] noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''inherent chirality''' is a property of asymmetry in molecules arising, not from a stereogenic or chiral center, but from a twisting of the molecule in 3-D space.   The term was first coined by Volker Boehmer in a 1994 review, to describe the chirality of [[calixarenes]] arising from their non-planar structure in 3-D space.

This phenomena was described as resulting from “the absence of a place of symmetry or an inversion center in the molecule as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalla Cort|first=Antonella|last2=Mandolini|first2=Luigi|last3=Pasquini|first3=Chiara|last4=Schiaffino|first4=Luca|date=2004-10-01|title="Inherent chirality" and curvature|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=B404388J|journal=New J.

== History ==

=== Calixarenes ===
After creating a series of traditionally chiral calixarenes (through the addition of a chiral substituent group on the top or bottom rim of the macrocycle,) the first inherently chiral calixarenes were synthesized in 1982, though the molecules were not yet described as such.  The inherently chiral calixarenes featured an XXYZ or WXYZ substitution pattern, such that the planar representation of the molecule does not show any chirality, and if the macrocycle were to be broken open, this would produce an achiral linear molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shao-Yong|last2=Xu|first2=Yao-Wei|last3=Liu|first3=Jun-Min|last4=Su|first4=Cheng-Yong|date=2011-01-17|title=Inherently Chiral Calixarenes: Synthesis, Optical Resolution, Chiral Recognition and Asymmetric Catalysis|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/12/1/429|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=429–455|doi=10.3390/ijms12010429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chirality in these calixarenes is instead derived from the curvature of the molecule in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7|title=Calixarenes and Beyond {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2corannulene.png|thumb|a) 2D representation of corannulene, b) 3D representation of corannulene bowl flip with C5 symmetry.]]

=== Definition ===
Due to the initial lack of a formal definition after the initial conception, the term inherent chirality was utilized to describe a variety of chiral molecules that don’t fall into other defined chirality types.  The first fully formulated definition of inherent chirality was published in 2004 by Mandolini and Schiaffino, (and later modified by Szumna):

''“inherent chirality arises from the introduction of a curvature in an ideal planar structure that is devoid of perpendicular symmetry planes in its bidimensional representation'''."'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inherent chirality has been known by a variety of names in the literature including bowl chirality (in fullerene fragments), intrinsic chirality, helicity (see section 3a) residual enantiomers (as applied to sterically hindered molecular propellers,) and cyclochirality (though this is often considered to be a more specific example and cannot be applied to all inherently chiral molecules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A simple example of inherent chirality is that of corannulene commonly referred to as “bowl chirality” in the literature.  The chirality of an unsubstituted corranulene (containing no classic stereogenic centers) cannot be seen in a 2D representation, but becomes clear when a 3D representation is evoked, as the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry of corranulenes provides the molecules with a source of chirality (figure 2.)  Racemization of these molecules is possible through an inversion of curvature, though some inherently chiral molecules have inversion barriers comparable to a classic chiral center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Molecular Symmetry ==
[[File:3paracyclophane.png|thumb|150x150px|Inherently chiral paracyclophane, rendered chiral by the bromide substituent hindering rotation of the phenylene.]]

=== Chiral Plane ===
Some inherently chiral molecules contain [[Planar chirality|chirality planes]], or planes within a given molecules across which the molecule is dissymmetric.  Paracyclophanes often contain chiral planes if the bridge across the phenylene unit is short enough, or if the phenylene contains another substituent, not in the bridge, that hinders rotation of the phenylene unit.

=== Chiral axis ===
Similar to chirality planes, [[Axial chirality|chirality axes]] arise from an axis about which the spatial arrangement of substituents creates chirality.  This can be seen in helical molecules (see section 3a) as well as some alkenes.

== Other examples ==
[[File:10helicene.png|thumb|133x133px|Helicene molecule with inherent chirality.]]
Helical molecules are considered to have inherent chirality, but this is sometimes referred to as helical chirality or ''helicity''.  The IUPAC definition of helicity is: ''chirality of a helical, propeller or screw-shaped molecular entity.''  [[Helicene]]s (figure 4) are chiral polycyclic aromatic compounds that lack conventional chiral centers, but are chiral due to the helical shape of the 3D molecules.

[[Spiro compound#Chirality|Spiro compounds]] (compounds with a twisted structure of two or more rings) can have inherent chirality at the spiroatom, due to the twisting of the achiral ring system.

Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of a “buckle” where in an achiral, linear alkene is forced into a chiral conformation.  Alkenes have no classical chirality, so generally, an external stereogenic center must be introduced.  However, by locking the alkene into a conformation through the use of an achiral buckle allows for the creation of an inherently chiral alkene.  Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of dialkoxysilanes, with a large enough racemization barrier that enantiomers have been isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomooka|first=Katsuhiko|last2=Miyasaka|first2=Shouji|last3=Motomura|first3=Shougo|last4=Igawa|first4=Kazunobu|date=2014-06-16|title=Planar Chiral Dialkoxysilane: Introduction of Inherent Chirality and High Reactivity in Conventional Achiral Alkene|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201402434/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=25|pages=7598–7602|doi=10.1002/chem.201402434|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaako Aaitui''' (born January 25, 1987) is an [[American football]] [[nose tackle]] who is currently a free agent. He was originally signed by the [[Miami Dolphins]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2011. He played [[college football]] at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]].

==Early years==
Aaitui attended Faga'itua High School in Pago Pago, where he played [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[volleyball]] and [[Association football|soccer]] in addition to [[high school football|football]] prior to graduating in 2006.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Player Bio: Isaako Aaitui | work = UNLVRebels.com | url = http://www.unlvrebels.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/aaitui_isaako00.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
After redshirting at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]] in 2006, Aaitui made his Rebels debut in 2007, appearing in seven games and recording 10 tackles (two for a loss).&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He started nine of 12 games played as a sophomore in 2008, totaling 32 tackles (14 solo), leading the team with seven tackles for a loss and tying for the team lead with two sacks.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

Aaitui started 10 of 12 games at defensive tackle as a junior in 2009, recording 31 tackles and 2.5 tackles for a loss.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He closed out his collegiate career with 27 tackles (5 for a loss), 1.5 sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked kick.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

==Professional career==

===First stint with Dolphins===
After going undrafted in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], Aaitui did not attend training camp and did not sign with a team until joining the [[practice squad]] of the [[Miami Dolphins]] on October 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="PracticeSquad"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins sign OT Will Barker away from Buccaneers; make practice squad moves | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2011/10/dolphins-sign-ot-will-barker-away-from.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the practice squad the rest of his rookie season and was re-signed to a future contract in January 2012.&lt;ref name="FutureDeal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins re-sign seven to future contracts | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2012/01/dolphins-sign-seven-to-future-contracts.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaitui's attempt to make the Dolphins' roster in 2012 was documented on the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] series ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins]]''.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hard Knocks' Isaako Aaitui waived by Jets after injury | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000058465/article/hard-knocks-isaako-aaitui-waived-by-jets-after-injury | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He came up just short of earning a roster spot and was waived by the team during final cuts, with the organization hoping to retain him on the practice squad.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New York Jets===
After being waived by the Dolphins, Aaitui made his first NFL roster when he was claimed by the [[New York Jets]] on September 2.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt; However, he suffered a [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and [[Medial knee injuries|MCL]] in his first practice with the Jets and was subsequently waived two days later.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New Orleans Saints===
After spending the 2012 season out of football with a knee injury, Aaitui signed a two-year contract with the [[New Orleans Saints]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name="Saints"&gt;{{cite web | title = New Orleans Saints Agree To Terms With DT Isaako Aaitui | work = NewOrleansSaints.com | url = http://www.neworleanssaints.com/news-and-events/article-1/New-Orleans-Saints-Agree-To-Terms-With-DT-Isaako-Aaitui/155a78ec-3b5f-410f-b886-f41588c7c650 | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was once again waived during final cuts on August 31.&lt;ref name="SaintsWaived"&gt;{{cite web | title = Saints Roster Cuts 2013: Saints Waive Isaako Aaitui | work = CanalStreetChronicles.com | url = http://www.canalstreetchronicles.com/2013/8/31/4680182/saints-roster-cuts-2013-isaako-aaitui | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stint with Dolphins===
Aaitui was re-signed by the Dolphins on September 17, 2013 to provide depth at the defensive tackle position due to an injury to [[Paul Soliai]].&lt;ref name="RejoinsDolphins"&gt;{{cite web | title = With Soliai sidelined, Dolphins bring back Isaako Aaitui, Al Lapuaho | work = FinNation.com | url = http://finnation.com/soliai-sidelined-dolphins-bring-back-isaako-aaitui-al-lapuaho/ | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the active roster on October 19 after the release of [[Marvin Austin]].&lt;ref name="DolphinsPromotion"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins promote DT Isaako Aaitui to the 53-man roster | work = The Sun Sentinel | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/dolphins-blog/sfl-dolphins-promote-dt-isaako-aaitui-to-the-53man-roster-20131019,0,3339645.story | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaitui made his NFL debut the following day, participating in 19 defensive snaps in the team's home loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]].&lt;ref name="NFLDebut"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bills vs Dolphins final look: Miami defensive snap counts | work = ThePhinsider.com | url = http://www.thephinsider.com/2013/10/23/4947176/bills-vs-dolphins-final-look-miami-defensive-snap-counts | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Aagaard''' (born 31 July 1973) is a [[Denmark|Danish]]-born [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[chess]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] and the 2007 [[British Chess Championship|British Chess Champion]]. He is Scotland's third highest rated player as of February 2018, with an [[Elo rating]] of 2481. In 2004, he took second place in the [[Scottish Chess Championship]]. In 2005, he took first place in the Scottish Championship but was not a British citizen, so the title went to [[Craig Pritchett]]. In 2012 he won the title, the first time he played and was eligible to win it. He is also a chess author and co-owner of [[Quality Chess]], a chess publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Speelman, Jon|title=Speelman on Chess|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/chess/story/0,,2151704,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 August 2007|accessdate=2008-03-07|authorlink=Jon Speelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kherubim''' or Kherans are an [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Wildstorm Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24114-wildstorm-vets-reunite-for-oral-history.html |title=WILDSTORM Vets Reunite For Oral History |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]]'' #1 (August 1992).

==Biology==
Kherubim are various groups/races of people from the planet Khera. Kherubim resemble humans in appearance but are physically far stronger and more durable and extremely long-lived, nearly [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] was harmed by armor-piercing machine gun bullets; however, after they are surgically removed, she makes a full and rapid recovery. Kherans (including Titanthropes) can interbreed with humans, bearing fertile offspring.

An evolutionary drawback to their near-immortality is that nearly all Kheran females are [[infertile]]; only very rarely will a Kheran produce offspring. This is a natural check against overpopulation. Only one in 10,000 Kheran females is capable of giving birth, and only then at her very first mating. Of those, only one in approximately 10,000 will become pregnant, and only 1 in 1000 of those babies will be born alive; the rest are stillborn. The saving grace of the species is that this infertility does not seem to apply when the Kheran is mating with another species, as Earth has various Kheran/human hybrids.

More powerful Kherans are known as Lords and may possess telekinetic and energy manipulation abilities. [[Mister Majestic]], [[Lord Emp]] and [[Spartan (comics)|Yohn Khol]] are Kherubim Lords.
 
Shapers are a [[subspecies]] of Kherans. They are [[shapeshifters]] who are able to manipulate the molecular structure of their bodies, transforming part or all of their bodies into a substance with [[metal]]lic properties, which they can manipulate and reshape at will. The Wildcat [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]] is a Shaper.

Though genetically a different species, the Titanthropes (or simply Titans) have been part of Kherubim society for so long that they are also often called Kherubim. However, they are considered and treated as second-class citizens of Khera by the Kherubim. They are large, purple-skinned humanoids who are able to increase or decrease their mass. Males have large yellow horns growing from their backs. A Titan's intelligence is inversely proportional to their current size. The Wildcat [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] is a Titanthrope.

==History==
Thousands of years ago, the Kherubim destroyed their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans would slowly become more or less accepted within the Kherubim society but remained [[second-class citizen]]s.

Millennia ago, the Kherans came into contact with the [[Daemonite]]s and a war erupted between both species. This war would last several centuries. A small group of Kherans and Daemonites crashlanded on Earth and inspired humanity with tales of gods, angels, demons, and monsters. Their conflict would continue until the end of the 20th century, while in space the Kherans would go on to defeat the Daemonites. Kherans imposed heavy [[indemnity|indemnities]] on the Daemonites and their society went bankrupt trying to pay them off. Khera allowed Daemonites to migrate to the more prosperous planet, but forced these Daemonites refugees to live in [[ghetto]]s.

When a small group of Kheran and half-Kheran heroes from Earth known as the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] arrived on Khera, they were welcomed as heroes, but quickly learned that Kheran society had changed over the years. Disgusted with the autocratic nature of Kheran society, they left the planet and returned to Earth.

Later, the Kherubim lord [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] found hidden Kheran devices, known as Planet Shaper Engines, beneath the surface of the Earth. This caused the realization that humanity and Kherans were closely related and that similar species had been seeded throughout the universe, creating both the Daemonites and Kherans in addition to humans.

The Shaper Guild from Khera arrived on Earth and announced that factions within Kherubim society had decided on using Planet Shaper Engines to transform the Earth into another Khera, causing a civil war.

==Culture==
Kherans are a warrior race with a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and [[honor]].

Due to their low fertility, every Kheran man and woman coming of age has to mate with an appointed partner. If the woman gives birth, she must become a priestess. If not, she may go on to live her life as she wishes. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] has managed to avoid becoming a priestess, despite giving birth, because her mother told others that the baby had died, allowing Zannah to become a warrior. Her mother then passed Zannah's baby, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]], off as Zealot's sister. As a mother of two children, Zannah's mother, Harmony, has become a living legend. No Kheran can remember the last time a Kheran woman gave birth to more than one child in her life. Zannah became the founder of the [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] Sisterhood.

Older and more powerful Kherans are named Lords. It remains unclear what makes a Kheran a Lord, but a Lord is capable of undergoing the ritual of Ascension when he is ready. The Ascension ritual is an important part of the Kheran culture, where a Lord asks a partner or good friend to destroy his body so that his spirit can be free. A Lord usually has so much energy stored in his body that this process tends to consume both Kherans.

The Coda worship a goddess, Hecate, but little is known about this religion. Other Kherans apparently do not worship any gods but believe in individual enlightenment through Ascension.

Though originally seen as noble and protective of other species, the Kherans were later shown to be quite [[speciesism|speciesist]], looking down upon other species while perceiving themselves as tolerant and benevolent.

==Politics==
The Kherans have a political system where various parties vie for power. The various factions include:
*The Pantheon, the party of the Lords. They are currently in power and stand for stability and economic progress.
*The Coda, a sisterhood of warriors. They want war and combat to prove their worth.
*The Shapers Guild represents all Shapers within Kheran society. They follow the orders from the Pantheon but have their own secret agenda. They claim to shape the destiny of Khera and are aware of its true origin.
*The Titantropes, while individually repressed by the Kherubim, hold great power as a faction. While being only a small political faction, it is in fact their vote that either keeps the Pantheon in power or puts the Coda in power.
* The Brotherhood of the Sword: a male version of the Coda, its members are created through [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. They devote their whole life to the mastery of bladed weapons and suppressing their own emotions. Some Bladesmen sacrifice themselves to become Scimitars, using stolen DNA from the Shapers Guild to become living war machines. The Brotherhood on Earth betrayed Khera and allied themselves with the Daemonites.
* The Adrastea: a race of Kherubim empaths, originally bred to be slaves, but they soon became the largest [[organized crime|crime syndicate]] in Kheran society.

==Technology==
While preferring bladed weapons in combat, Kherans are technologically advanced. They own spaceships capable of interstellar flights. They are capable of inscribing knowledge in the form of organic molecules, which when injected into the bloodstream, downloads that knowledge straight into the brain. They are capable of manipulating the laws of chance, simply for the purpose of entertainment as their 'Coincidental Mansion' shows. Armies of very advanced [[Android (robot)|androids]] known as the [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan Guards]] serve as soldiers. Spartan Guards have shown high intelligence and superhuman physical capabilities. Kherubim Planet Shapers can [[Terraforming|terraform]] worlds and alter living DNA and can remain functional for billions of years.

==Notable Kherans==
*[[Mister Majestic|Lord Majestros]], the greatest living hero for all Kherubim.
*[[Lord Emp]], ascended from the physical plane. Former member of the Pantheon.
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]], former member of the Coda.
*[[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]
*[[Spartan (comics)|Lord Yohn Kohl]], the template for the android Spartan.
*Lord S'lyton, father of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Marc Slayton]]
*Ferrian, member of [[Wildcore]].
*Charis, also known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]. An Adrastea with empathic abilities, trained by the Coda.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">In Turkic mythology, '''Konrul''' or '''Kongrul / Konqrul''' (''Koñrul'', Azerbaijani: ''Qonrul'') is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn.

In [[Turkish people|Turkish]] folklore, Konrul refers to a supernatural bird, often glossed as, or identified with, the Greek [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] or Persian ''[[Simurgh|Simurg]]'' (in Turkish languages '''Semrük'''&lt;ref name="Juan"&gt;Juan Eduardo Cirlot, A Dictionary of Symbols, Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p.253&lt;/ref&gt;).

Konrul is depicted as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion; sometimes however also with a human face. It has an enmity towards snakes and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be the colour of copper, and though it was originally described as being a Dog-Bird, later it was shown with either the head of a dog.

==Different aspects of other mythologies==
In [[Turkic mythology|Turkic culture]] Konrul has a twin and its name is '''Toghrul''' ([[Turul]]). In one of the folk tales, a hero rescues Konruls offspring by killing a snake that was crawling up the tree to feed upon them. As a reward, Konrul gives him three of her feathers which the hero can use to call her for help by burning them. Later the hero uses the feathers, and the Konrul carries him to a distant land. In the other tale, Konrul carries the hero out of the netherworld; here Konrul feeds its young with its teats.

===Turul and Kongrul===
Turul and Konrul are twin birds in Turkish mythology. They known also '''Buğdayık and Kumayık''' or '''Semrük and Kerkes''' and sometimes '''Züzülö and Öksökö'''. They roosted in Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world. The relationship between the Turul and Konrul is extremely close.

==Similarities with Anka==
'''Anka''' also spelled '''Ankha''', also known as '''Angha''' (Persian: عنقا), is a benevolent, mythical flying creature and common figure in Middle East cultures. The figure can be found in all periods of Greater Iranian art and literature, and is evident also in the iconography of medieval Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;P Donabedian and J. M. Thierry, ''Armenian Art'', New York, 1989, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; the Byzantine empire,&lt;ref&gt;Thierry, N. and M., ''Nouvelles églises rupestres de Cappadoce'', Paris, 1963, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; and other regions that were within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. The mythical bird is also found in the mythology of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and is called ''Semrug, Semurg, Samran and Samruk''.&lt;ref name="Juan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Artikel in the Encyclopedia of Bashkortostan&lt;/ref&gt; Simurgh is shortened to "Sīmīr" in the Kurdish language.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Hanns-Peter Schmidt, Encyclopedia Iranica - "Simorgh".&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Azeri folklore===
Konrul also goes by the name of ''Zumrud'' (emerald). It was an ancient tale about Malik Mammad, the son of one of the wealthiest kings of Azerbaijan. That king had a big garden. In the center of this garden is a magical apple tree which yields apples every day. One ugly giant called Div decides to steal all the apples every night. The king sends Malik Mammad and his elder brothers fight the giant. In the middle of this tale Malik Mammad saves Zumrud's babies from a dragon. Zumrud takes pleasure of Malik Mammad and decides to help him. When Malik Mammad wants to pass from The Dark world into the Light world Zumrud asks him to provide 40 half carcasses of meat and 40 wineskin filled with water. When Zumrud puts water on its left wing and meat on its right wing Malik Mammad is able to enter the Light world.

[[Image:Langtons Loop.png|frame|right|Langton's Loop, in the starting configuration.]]

'''Langton's loops''' are a particular "species" of [[artificial life]] in a [[cellular automaton]] created in 1984 by [[Christopher Langton]]. They consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information, which flows continuously around the loop and out along an "arm" (or [[pseudopod]]), which will become the daughter loop. The "genes" instruct it to make three left turns, completing the loop, which then disconnects from its parent.

== History ==

In 1952 [[John von Neumann]] created the first cellular automaton (CA) with the goal of creating a self-replicating machine.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.'' |author=von Neumann, John |author2=Burks, Arthur W. |date=1966 |publisher=www.walenz.org |format=Scanned book online |accessdate=2008-02-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |archivedate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automaton was necessarily very complex due to its computation- and construction-universality. In 1968 [[Edgar F. Codd]] reduced the number of states from 29 in [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] to 8 in [[Codd's cellular automaton|his]].&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Christopher Langton did away with the universality condition, he was able to significantly reduce the automaton's complexity. Its self-replicating loops are based on one of the simplest elements in Codd's automaton, the periodic emitter.

== Specification ==

Langton's Loops run in a CA that has 8 states, and uses the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. The [[State transition table|transition table]] can be found here: [http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheRules#Self-replicating_loops].

As with [[Codd's cellular automaton|Codd's CA]], Langton's Loops consist of sheathed wires. The signals travel passively along the wires until they reach the open ends, when the command they carry is executed.

[[Image:Langtons Loop Colony.png|thumb|right|A colony of loops. The ones in the centre are "dead".]]

=== Colonies ===

Because of a particular property of the loops' "pseudopodia", they are unable to reproduce into the space occupied by another loop. Thus, once a loop is surrounded, it is incapable of reproducing, resulting in a [[coral]]-like colony with a thin layer of reproducing organisms surrounding a core of inactive "dead" organisms. Unless provided unbounded space, the colony's size will be limited. The maximum population will be [[asymptote|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left \lfloor \frac{A}{121} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is the total area of the space in cells.

=== Encoding of the genome ===

The loops' genetic code is stored as a series of nonzero-zero state pairs. The standard loop's genome is illustrated in the picture at the top, and may be stated as a series of numbered states starting from the T-junction and running clockwise: 70-70-70-70-70-70-40-40. The '70' command advances the end of the wire by one cell, while the '40-40' sequence causes the left turn. State 3 is used as a temporary marker for several stages.

While the roles of states 0,1,2,3,4 and 7 are similar to Codd's CA, the remaining states 5 and 6 are used instead to mediate the loop replication process. After the loop has completed, state 5 travels counter-clockwise along the sheath of the parent loop to the next corner, causing the next arm to be produced in a different direction.  State 6 temporarily joins the genome of the daughter loop and initialises the growing arm at the next corner it reaches.

The genome is used a total of six times: once to extend the pseudopod to the desired location, four times to complete the loop, and again to [[DNA replication|transfer]] the genome into the daughter loop. Clearly, this is dependent on the fourfold [[rotational symmetry]] of the loop; without it, the loop would be incapable of containing the information required to describe it. The same use of symmetry for genome compression is used in many biological [[viruses]], such as the [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] [[adenovirus]].

'''Last words''' or '''final words''' are a person's final articulated words, stated prior to [[death]] or as death approaches. Last words may not necessarily be written down or accurately recorded, and they may not be quoted accurately for a variety of reasons.

==Famous last words==
{{see also|List of last words}}
Famous last words include both the literal utterings; such as the [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]], from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''", and the [[Irony|ironical]] sense of words said before a disaster, such as:
* "They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance!" General [[John Sedgwick]] at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] immediately before being killed by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Shelby. ''The Civil War: A Narrative. vol. 3, Red River to Appomattox''. New York: Random House, 1974. {{ISBN|0-394-74913-8}}. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Let all brave Prussians follow me!" Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin]] at the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]], immediately before getting hit in the head by a cannonball.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, S. (1856). ''The Percy Anecdotes'': Revised edition... New York City, NY: Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Don't worry about it ... look, the clip is not even in it." [[Terry Kath]] of the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], just before putting a pistol to his temple and pulling the trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Forgotten_Heroes_Terry_Kath|title=Forgotten Heroes: Terry Kath|first=Corbin|last=Reiff|journal=Premier Guitar|date=May 11, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last words reported to have been uttered by a person revered as a martyr or hero of a religious, nationalist, or revolutionary movement often gain a political significance and are extensively quoted in later literature and/or used as a slogan. However, in many such cases their historical authenticity is doubted.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

'''Life''' is a characteristic that distinguishes [[physical body|physical entities]] that have [[biological process]]es, such as [[Cell signaling|signaling]] and [[self-sustainability|self-sustaining]] processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have [[Death|died]]), or because they never had such functions and are classified as [[wikt:inanimate|inanimate]]. Various forms of life exist, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, or potential [[Synthetic biology#Synthetic life|synthetic life]] as "living". [[Biology]] is the science concerned with the study of life.

The definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that [[organism]]s are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]] that maintain [[homeostasis]], are composed of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], have a [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], undergo [[metabolism]], can [[cell growth|grow]], [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment, respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduction|reproduce]] and [[Evolution|evolve]]. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life" through obsolete concepts such as [[odic force]], [[hylomorphism]], [[spontaneous generation]] and [[vitalism]], that have now been disproved by [[Biological research|biological discoveries]]. [[Abiogenesis]] describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple [[organic compounds]]. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core [[chemical element]]s to sustain [[biochemical]] functions.

Life on Earth [[Earliest known life forms|first appeared]] as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4.3b oldest" /&gt; Earth's current life may have descended from an [[RNA world]], although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which [[abiogenesis|life began on Earth]] is unknown, though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. The [[earliest known life forms]] are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old [[Australia]]n rocks are reported to have contained [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="WU-20171218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |website=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a [[geologic time scale]]. To survive in most [[ecosystem]]s, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions. Some microorganisms, called [[extremophile]]s, thrive in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment]]s that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. [[Aristotle]] was the first person to [[taxonomy (biology)|classify]] organisms. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced [[Linnean taxonomy|his system]] of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of [[species]]. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14425949/Cell-The-Fundamental-Unit-of-Life Chapter-5, The Fundamental Unit of Life]. Monika Mehan. Scribd.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of cells, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], both of which consist of [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[membrane]] and contain many [[biomolecules]] such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acid]]s. Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]], in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

Though currently only known on [[Earth]], life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. [[Artificial life]] is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all [[Biological process|biological functions]] which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. [[Extinction]] is the process by which an entire group or [[taxon]], normally a [[species]], dies out. [[Fossil]]s are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms.

[[File:Characteristics of life.svg|thumb|The characteristics of life]]
Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment. This characteristic exhibits all or most of the following traits:&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koshland&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Seven Pillars of Life |journal=Science |date=22 March 2002 |first=Daniel E. |last=Koshland, Jr. |volume=295 |issue=5563 |pages=2215–16 |doi=10.1126/science.1068489 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |accessdate=25 May 2009 |pmid=11910092 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228202918/http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |last= |first= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-618-70173-5 |edition=4th |location= |pages= |chapter=life |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|title=Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110042620/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P58Tsw9q?url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |archivedate=24 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JBS-2012Feb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trifonov |first=Edward N. |title=Definition of Life: Navigation through Uncertainties |url=http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=647–50 |issn=0739-1102 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |doi=10.1080/073911012010525017 |pmid=22208269 |date=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127142426/http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science/#.WCcX-snQf0w |title=Can scientists define 'life' ... using just three words? |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |date=11 January 2012 |work=NBC News |access-date=12 November 2016 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414085107/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science#.WCcX-snQf0w |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Homeostasis]]''': regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature
# '''[[Biological organization|Organization]]''': being structurally composed of one or more [[cell (biology)|cells]]&amp;nbsp;– the basic units of life
# '''[[Metabolism]]''': transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components ([[anabolism]]) and decomposing organic matter ([[catabolism]]). Living things require [[bioenergetics|energy]] to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.
# '''[[Cell growth|Growth]]''': maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.
# '''[[Adaptation]]''': the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of [[evolution]] and is determined by the organism's [[heredity]], diet, and external factors.
# '''Response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]''': a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a [[unicellular organism]] to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of [[multicellular organisms]]. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun ([[phototropism]]), and [[chemotaxis]].
# '''[[Reproduction]]''': the ability to produce new individual organisms, either [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from a single parent organism or [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] from two parent organisms.

These complex processes, called [[Physiology|physiological functions]], have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as [[Signalling (biology)|signaling and control mechanisms]] that are essential to maintaining life.

===Living systems theories===
Living systems are open [[self-organization|self-organizing]] living things that interact with their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]], and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |authorlink= |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=8 October 2007 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and [[Biology|biological sciences]] and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist [[James Hutton]]. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be [[physiology]].

====Nonfractionability====
The first attempt at a general [[living systems]] theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist [[James Grier Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82421-7 |date=8 October 2007}} Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory."...&amp;nbsp;"Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life |first1=Rosen |last1=Robert |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0-231-07565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life as a property of ecosystems====
A systems view of life treats environmental [[flux]]es and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm |title=The Ecosystemic Life Hypothesis |last=Fiscus |first=Daniel A. |date=April 2002 |website= |publisher=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806015449/http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm|archive-date=6 August 2009|dead-url=yes |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As [[Harold J. Morowitz]] (1992) explains it, life is a property of an [[ecosystem|ecological system]] rather than a single organism or species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morowitz |first1=Harold J. |date=1992 |title=Beginnings of cellular life: metabolism recapitulates biogenesis |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-05483-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905030901/https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly [[biochemical]] or physical one. [[Robert Ulanowicz]] (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert W. |last1=Ulanowicz |first2=Robert E. |last2=Ulanowicz |title=A third window: natural life beyond Newton and Darwin |publisher=Templeton Foundation Press |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-59947-154-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903180028/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex systems biology====
{{main|Complex systems biology}}{{See also|Mathematical biology}}
Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of [[dynamic systems]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baianu |first1=I. C. |date=2006 |title=Robert Rosen's Work and Complex Systems Biology |url= |journal=Axiomathes |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–34 |doi=10.1007/s10516-005-4204-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is also often called [[systems biology]] and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a [[category theory]] of biological relations, as well as an [[algebraic topology]] of the [[functional organization]] of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex [[Biological network|networks]] of metabolic, genetic, and [[epigenetic]] processes and [[signaling pathway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958a |title=A Relational Theory of Biological Systems |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=245–60 |doi=10.1007/bf02478302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958b |title=The Representation of Biological Systems from the Standpoint of the Theory of Categories |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=317–41 |doi=10.1007/bf02477890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël |last2=Mossio |first2=Matteo |date=2015-05-07 |year= |title=Biological organisation as closure of constraints |url=https://www.academia.edu/11705712 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=372 |pages=179–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.02.029 |pmid=25752259 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143806/http://www.academia.edu/11705712/Biological_organisation_as_closure_of_constraints |archivedate=17 November 2017 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darwinian dynamic====
It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Darwinian Dynamic |volume=58 |issue=2 |author1=Harris Bernstein |author2=Henry C.

The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"/&gt;

====Operator theory====
Another systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that "life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Pursuit of Complexity: The Utility of Biodiversity from an Evolutionary Perspective |last=Jagers |first=Gerard |publisher=KNNV Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-90-5011-443-1 |location= |pages= |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a Hierarchical Definition of Life, the Organism, and Death |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Explaining the Origin of Life is not Enough for a Definition of Life |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The role of logic and insight in the search for a definition of life |journal=J.

Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. [[Empedocles]] (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is made up of a combination of [[Classical element|four eternal "elements"]] or "roots of all": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=4 March 2005 |title=Empedocles |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/ |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a [[soul]] (''psyche''). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a ''living'' thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.&lt;ref name=democritus&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=25 August 2010 |title=Democritus |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#4 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher [[René Descartes]], who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in [[cell theory]] in biological science encouraged this view. The [[evolution]]ary theory of [[Charles Darwin]] (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Thagard |title=The Cognitive Science of Science: Explanation, Discovery, and Conceptual Change |publisher=MIT Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-262-01728-2 |pages=204–05 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903184310/https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hylomorphism===
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]]]]
Hylomorphism is a theory first expressed by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and [[Aristotle's biology|biology is extensively covered in his extant writings]]. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''psyche'', Latin ''anima''). There are three kinds of souls: the ''vegetative soul'' of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the ''animal soul'', which causes animals to move and feel; and the ''rational soul'', which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On the Soul |last=Aristotle |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=Book II |nopp=y |chapter= |quote= |via=|title-link=On the Soul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Don |last1=Marietta |page=104 |title=Introduction to ancient philosophy |publisher=M.

This account is consistent with [[teleological]] explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past [[evolutionary history]] of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.&lt;ref name=stewert_williams2010&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Steve |last1=Stewart-Williams |date=2010 |title=Darwin, God and the meaning of life: how evolutionary theory undermines everything you thought you knew of life |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76278-6 |pages=193–94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903134432/https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origines Sacrae |last=Stillingfleet |first=Edward |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1697 |isbn= |location= |pages= |quote= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century.

All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their [[common descent]]; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a [[universal common ancestor]], from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to [[protocell]]s and metabolism. Models have been divided into "genes-first" and "metabolism-first" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coveney |first1=Peter V. |first2=Philip W. |last2=Fowler |title=Modelling biological complexity: a physical scientist's perspective |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=2005 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–80 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0045|pmc=1578273 |pmid=16849185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no current [[scientific consensus]] as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and the work of [[Sidney W. Fox|Sidney Fox]], which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417155949/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phospholipid]]s spontaneously form [[lipid bilayer]]s, the basic structure of a [[cell membrane]].

Living organisms synthesize [[proteins]], which are [[polymer]]s of amino acids using instructions encoded by [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). [[Protein synthesis]] entails intermediary [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senapathy |first1=Periannan |authorlink=Periannan Senapathy |title=Independent birth of organisms |location=Madison, Wisconsin |publisher=Genome Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-9641304-0-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905095531/https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |first2=Ruthild |last2=Winkler |title=Steps towards life: a perspective on evolution (German edition, 1987) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992 |page=31 |isbn=978-0-19-854751-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Steps_towards_life.html?id=R7QTAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the [[chicken or the egg]]. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/05/13/how-rna-got-started-scientists-examine-the-origins-of-life |title=How RNA Got Started: Scientists Look for the Origins of Life |last=Barazesh |first=Solmaz |date=13 May 2009 |work=U.

Therefore, a possibility, first suggested by [[Francis Crick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James D. |title=Prologue: early speculations and facts about RNA templates |pages=xv–xxiii |work=The RNA World | editor1-first=R.

F. | editor2-last=Atkins |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the first life was based on [[RNA]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the [[catalysis|catalytic]] properties of some proteins. This is called the [[RNA world hypothesis]], and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that [[Evolution|evolve]] the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[NADH]], etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them.

One issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA.&lt;ref name=Cech&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=T.R. |date=2011 |title=The RNA Worlds in Context |url= |journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume=4 |issue=7 |page= |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 |pmid=21441585 |pages=a006742 |pmc=3385955}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor [[phosphate]] present throughout the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powner |first1=Matthew W. |first2=Béatrice |last2=Gerland |first3=John D. |last3=Sutherland |title=Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible conditions |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=239–42 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08013 |pmid=19444213 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..239P |issue=7244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=Jack W. |title=Origins of life: Systems chemistry on early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=171–72 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/459171a |bibcode=2009Natur.459..171S |issue=7244 |pmid=19444196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA====
{{Main|DNA}}
Deoxyribonucleic acid is a [[molecule]] that carries most of the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many viruses. DNA and [[RNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; alongside [[protein]]s and [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], they are one of the three major types of [[macromolecules|macromolecule]] that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna |title=DNA |date=5 February 2016 |website=Basic Biology |publisher= |access-date=15 November 2016 |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archivedate=5 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of a [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]—either [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), [[adenine]] (A), or [[thymine]] (T)—as well as a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]] and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. According to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T, and C with G), [[hydrogen bond]]s bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA [[base pair]]s on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718153742/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |archivedate=18 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

DNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] (animals, plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Peter |title=iGenetics |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8053-4553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s (bacteria and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dahm R |title=Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research |journal=Hum.

==Classification==
{{Main|Biological classification}}
{{Biological classification}}
Life is usually classified by eight levels of taxa—domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species. In May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion [[species]] are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.&lt;ref name="NSF-2016002" /&gt;

The first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds ([[mammal]]s), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and [[amphibian]]s), birds, fishes and [[Cetacea|whales]]. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects (which included the spiders, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most [[mollusc]]s and [[echinoderm]]s), and "[[zoophyte]]s" (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|title=Aristotle|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|via=|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120124920/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title=Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=359&amp;issue=1444&amp;spage=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon [[Vermes]] in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. [[Herbert Copeland|Copeland]] classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=13|issue=4 |doi=10.1086/394568 |year=1938 |page=383 | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Herbert F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was eventually solved by [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]], when he gave them their own [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] in his [[five-kingdom system]]. [[Evolutionary history of life|Evolutionary history]] shows that the fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whittaker |first1=R.

As new discoveries enabled detailed study of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of [[cell biology]] and [[microbiology]] were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in [[protozoa]] as animals and [[thallophyte|protophyta/thallophyta]] as plants, but were united by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] in the kingdom [[Protista]]; later, the [[prokaryote]]s were split off in the kingdom [[Monera]], which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the [[Archaea]]. This led to the [[six-kingdom system]] and eventually to the current [[three-domain system]], which is based on evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="Woese1990"/&gt; However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Adl 05"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, etal |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

As microbiology, [[molecular biology]] and [[virology]] developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and [[viroid]]s. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into "species" based on their biology and [[genetics]], but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Van Regenmortel MH |title=Virus species and virus identification: past and current controversies |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16713373 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2006.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s a trend called [[cladistics]] emerged, arranging [[taxa]] based on [[clade]]s in an [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary or phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Taxonomy.

There are two primary types of cells. [[Prokaryote]]s lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, although they have circular DNA and [[ribosome]]s. Bacteria and [[Archaea]] are two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the [[eukaryote]]s, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and [[vacuoles]]. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are [[protist]] [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whitman |first1=W. |last2=Coleman |first2=D. |last3=Wiebe |first3=W. |title=Prokaryotes: The unseen majority |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6578–83 |date=1998 |pmid=9618454 |pmc=33863 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6578W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional model is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through [[endosymbiosis]] between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Norman R. |last1=Pace |title=Concept Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |page=289 |date=18 May 2006 |doi=10.1038/441289a |url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68GROFAbU?url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archivedate=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012 |pmid=16710401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |issue=7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The molecular mechanisms of [[cell biology]] are based on [[protein]]s. Most of these are synthesized by the ribosomes through an [[Enzyme catalysis|enzyme-catalyzed]] process called [[protein biosynthesis]]. A sequence of amino acids is assembled and joined together based upon [[gene expression]] of the cell's nucleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific background |website=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 |publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150754/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In eukaryotic cells, these proteins may then be transported and processed through the [[Golgi apparatus]] in preparation for dispatch to their destination.&lt;ref name="pmid20605430"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Passage through the Golgi |journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=471–78 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.05.003 |pmid=20605430 |vauthors=Nakano A, Luini A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]] in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of [[Fission (biology)|fission]] in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In [[eukaryote]]s, a more complex process of [[mitosis]] is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for [[mutations]]), and both are capable of further division following an [[interphase]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Panno |title=The Cell |series=Facts on File science library |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-8160-6736-7 |pages=60–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904151747/https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicellular organism]]s may have first evolved through the formation of [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of identical cells. These cells can form group organisms through [[cell adhesion]]. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed [[Clone (cell biology)|clonally]] or from a single [[germ cell]] that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Dennis |last2=Bray |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=James D. |last6=Watson |chapter=From Single Cells to Multicellular Organisms |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-8153-1620-6 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306165115/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, scientists reported that, [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|about 800 million years ago]], a [[Evolutionary developmental biology|minor genetic change]] in a single [[molecule]], called GK-PID, may have allowed [[organism]]s to go from a [[Unicellular organism|single cell organism]] to [[Multicellular organism|one of many cells]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Genetic Flip Helped Organisms Go From One Cell to Many |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |date=7 January 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107204432/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |archivedate=7 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. [[Cell signaling]] coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using [[juxtacrine signalling]], or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the [[endocrine system]]. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=alberts2002&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Alexander |last2=Johnson |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=Peter |last6=Walter |chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000612/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Solar System, the region around another [[main sequence|main-sequence star]] that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet is known as the [[habitable zone]]. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the Sun-like "main sequence" of [[stellar evolution]] for a shorter time interval. Small [[red dwarf]]s have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of magnetic activity and the effects of [[tidal locking]] from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop.&lt;ref name=selis2006&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Selis |date=2006 |chapter=Habitability: the point of view of an astronomer |title=Lectures in Astrobiology |volume=2 |editor1-first=Muriel |editor1-last=Gargaud |editor2-first=Hervé |editor2-last=Martin |editor3-first=Philippe |editor3-last=Claeys |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-33692-1 |pages=210–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903233938/https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming.

After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Organisms may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]] and leftover [[organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms that recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]].

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins.&lt;ref name=define_death/&gt; However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071129/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |archivedate=1 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of [[afterlife]] or [[reincarnation]] for the [[soul]], or [[resurrection]] of the body at a later date.

===Extinction===
{{Main|Extinction}}
Extinction is the process by which a group of [[taxa]] or [[species]] dies out, reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Extinction&amp;nbsp;– definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwseRB80?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing [[habitat]] or against superior competition. In [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Triassic/extinction.htm |title=What is an extinction? |website=Late Triassic |publisher=Bristol University |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901011807/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/palaeofiles/triassic/extinction.htm |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=31 December 1996 |isbn=978-0-412-63380-5 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164104/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

===Fossils===
{{Main|Fossils}}
Fossils are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing [[rock (geology)|rock]] formations and [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] layers ([[stratum|strata]]) is known as the ''fossil record''. A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510101706/http://sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the [[Holocene]] Epoch to the oldest from the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon, up to 3.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Vastag |title=Oldest 'microfossils' raise hopes for life on Mars |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019000458/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Geological Team Lays Claim to Oldest Known Fossils |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501085118/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miro Aaltonen''' (born 7 June 1993) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]. He is currently playing with [[HC Vityaz]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-sign-khl-forward-miro-aaltonen-entry-level-contract/  | title = Miro Aaltonen signing with Toronto Maple Leafs | publisher = ''[[Sportsnet.ca]]'' | date = 2017-03-17 | accessdate = 2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was selected by [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] in the 2nd round (45th overall) of the [[2011 KHL Junior Draft]], and he was also selected by the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the 6th round (177th overall) of the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Following the [[2016-17 KHL season|2016–17]] season, after recording a career best 44 points in 59 games after his first season with [[HC Vityaz]] in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], he signed an entry-level contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] on March 17, 2017.

Despite a strong push for a roster spot as the Leafs' [[Line (ice hockey)|fourth-line]] center, he was assigned to the Maple Leafs [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Toronto Marlies]] for the [[2017–18 AHL season|2017–18]] season. In adapting to his first North American season, Aaltonen established himself among the offensive leaders with the Marlies, contributing with 20 goals and 43 points in 64 regular season games. Unable to earn a call up to the NHL, Aaltonen continued in the post-season with the Marlies, helping claim the club's first [[Calder Cup]] in posting 13 points in 20 games.

As an impending restricted free agent from the Maple Leafs but unable to make his NHL debut, Aaltonen opted to return to the KHL on a contract with former Russian club, Vityaz on July 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = http://www.hcvityaz.ru/news.php?full=9650 | title = Miro Aaltonen returns to Vityaz | publisher = ''[[HC Vityaz]]'' | date = 2018-07-01 | accessdate = 2018-07-01 | language = Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40122">'''''Mycoplasma laboratorium''''' is a designed, partially [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] species of [[bacterium]] derived from the [[genome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''. This effort in [[synthetic biology]] is being undertaken at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] by a team of approximately 20 scientists headed by [[Nobel laureate]] [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] and including [[DNA]] researcher [[Craig Venter]] and [[microbiologist]] [[Clyde A. Hutchison III]].  ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' from a computer record and transplanted it into an existing cell of ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' that had its DNA removed. The team used ''M. mycoides'' instead of ''M. genitalium'' because it grew faster. The new bacterium was viable—that is, capable of [[bacterial replication|replicating]] billions of times—but not, strictly speaking, a truly synthetic life form.&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists create synthetic cell, version 1.0|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20005533-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

It is estimated that the synthetic genome cost US$40 million and 200 [[man-hour#Similar units|man-years]] to produce.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt; Despite the controversy, Venter's company [[Synthetic Genomics]] has secured over $110 million in investment capital and inked a $300 million deal with [[Exxon Mobil]] to design [[algae fuel|algae for diesel fuel]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt;

==''Mycoplasma''==
{{main|Mycoplasma}}

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

''Mycoplasma'' is a genus of [[bacteria]] of the class [[Mollicutes]] in the division [[Tenericutes]], characterised by the lack of a [[cell wall]] (making it [[Gram negative]]) due to its [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] lifestyle.
In [[molecular biology]], the genus has received much attention, both for being a notoriously difficult-to-eradicate (immune to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] and other [[antibiotics]]) contaminant in mammalian [[cell culture]]s,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;Young L, Sung J, Stacey G, Masters JR. "Detection of ''Mycoplasma'' in cell cultures". ''Nat Protoc.'' 2010 '''5'''(5): 929–34. Epub 2010 Apr 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and for its potential uses as a [[model organism]]: the second published complete bacterial genome sequence was that of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'', which has one of the smallest [[genome]]s of any free-living (non-[[parasitic]]) organism.&lt;ref group="a" name=Fraser&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fraser CM, Gocayne JD, White O, etal |title=The minimal gene complement of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=270 |issue=5235 |pages=397–403 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7569993 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5235.397|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7569993|bibcode = 1995Sci...270..397F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''M. pneumoniae'' genome sequence was published soon afterward and was the first genome sequence determined by [[primer walking]] of a [[cosmid]] library instead of the [[whole-genome shotgun]] method.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Himmelreich R, Hilbert H, Plagens H, Pirkl E, Li BC, Herrmann R |title=Complete sequence analysis of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=4420–49 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8948633 |pmc=146264 |doi= 10.1093/nar/24.22.4420|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8948633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this species was chosen as a model for the [[artificial cell|minimal cell]] project,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hutchison CA, Montague MG | chapter = Mycoplasmas and the minimal genome concept | title=Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas (Razin S, Herrmann R, eds.)| pages=221–54 | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | location=New York |year = 2002 | chapter-url = | isbn = 978-0-306-47287-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catalog the entire protein content of a cell.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Regula JT, Ueberle B, Boguth G, etal |title=Towards a two-dimensional proteome map of Mycoplasma pneumoniae |journal=Electrophoresis |volume=21 |issue=17 |pages=3765–80 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11271496 |doi=10.1002/1522-2683(200011)21:17&lt;3765::AID-ELPS3765&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other genera==
''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'' (an [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-proteobacterium]] of the order [[Rickettsiales]]) has the smallest known genome (1,308,759 base pairs) of any free living organism and is one of the smallest self-replicating cells known. It is possibly the most numerous bacterium in the world (perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; individual cells) and, along with other members of the [[Pelagibacterales|SAR11 clade]], are estimated to make up between a quarter and a half of all bacterial or [[archaea]]l cells in the ocean.&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morris RM, etal | title=SAR11 clade dominates ocean surface bacterioplankton communities |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=420 |pages=806–10 | year=2002 | doi=10.1038/nature01240 | pmid=12490947 | issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..806M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this species was identified only in 2002 by [[16S ribosomal RNA|rRNA sequences]] and was fully sequenced in 2005,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Stephen J.

&lt;!-- There reason why 3 extra species are present is that N. equitans is smaller in size but has more genes, the other sequenced species are Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Blochmannia genus, many Buchnera and many mycoplasmata and Ureaplasma, so not that interesting.  --&gt;

==Minimal genome project==
The team started with the bacterium ''M. genitalium'', an [[obligate intracellular parasite]] whose [[genome]] consists of 482 [[gene]]s comprising 582,970 [[base pairs]], arranged on one circular [[chromosome]] (the smallest genome of any known natural organism that can be grown in free culture). They then systematically removed genes to find a minimal set of 382 genes that can sustain life.&lt;ref group="a" name="minimal"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This effort was also known as the '''Minimal Genome Project'''.

The team intends to synthesize chromosome DNA sequences consisting of these 382 genes. Once a version of the minimal 382-gene chromosome has been synthesized, it is intended to be transplanted into a ''M. genitalium'' cell to create Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The resulting Mycoplasma laboratorium bacterium is expected to be able to [[DNA replication|replicate]] itself with its man-made DNA, making it the most synthetic organism to date, although the molecular machinery and chemical environment that would allow it to replicate would not be synthetic.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, the team had reported a fast method of synthesizing a genome from scratch, producing the 5386-base genome of the [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi X 174]] in about two weeks.&lt;ref  group="a" name="virus"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the genome of Mycoplasma laboratorium is about 50 times larger. In January 2008, the team reported to have synthesized the complete 582,970 base pair chromosome of ''M. genitalium'', with small modifications so that it won't be infectious and can be distinguished from the [[wild type]]. They named this genome ''Mycoplasma genitalium JCVI-1.0''.&lt;ref  group="a" name="synthesis"&gt;{{Cite journal

Venter hopes to eventually synthesize bacteria to manufacture [[hydrogen]] and [[biofuel]]s, and also to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. [[George M. Church]], another pioneer in [[synthetic biology]], holds that ''[[E. coli]]'' is a more efficient organism than ''M. genitalium'' and that creating a fully synthetic genome is not necessary and too costly for such tasks; he points out that synthetic genes have already been incorporated into ''E.coli'' to perform some of the above tasks.&lt;ref group="b" name=sciam&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=longest-piece-of-dna-yet Longest Piece of Synthetic DNA Yet], ''Scientific American News'', 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--copypaste--&gt;
On June 28, 2007, a team at the J. Craig Venter Institute published an article in ''Science Express'', saying that they had successfully transplanted the natural DNA from a ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' bacterium into a ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' cell, creating a bacterium which behaved like a ''M. mycoides''.&lt;ref group="a" name="transfer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Oct 6, 2007, Craig Venter announced in an interview with UK's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that the same team had synthesized a modified version of the single [[chromosome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' [[Artificial gene synthesis|chemically]]. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this ''minimal genome project'' is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called Mycoplasma laboratorium. The next day the Canadian [[bioethics]] group, [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued a statement through their representative, [[Pat Roy Mooney|Pat Mooney]], saying Venter's "creation" was "a chassis on which you could build almost anything". The synthesized genome had not yet been transplanted into a working cell.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 Oct 2009 | accessdate=23 Nov 2012 | title=I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer | location=London | first=Ed | last=Pilkington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' from a computer record, and transplanted the synthesized genome into the existing cell of a ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' bacterium that had had its DNA removed. The "synthetic" bacterium was viable, i.e. capable of replicating billions of times. The team had originally planned to use the ''M. genitalium'' bacterium they had previously been working with, but switched to ''M. mycoides'' because the latter bacterium grows much faster, which translated into quicker experiments.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have also shown that the natural genome of ''M. mycoides'' can be transplanted but has yet to show that the same could be done for ''M. genitalium''.&lt;ref group="b" name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genomics: DNA's master craftsmen |author= Roberta Kwok |journal= Nature |year= 2010 |volume=468|issue=7320|pages=22–5 |doi= 10.1038/468022a |pmid=21048740 |bibcode = 2010Natur.468...22K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter describes it as "the first species.... to have its parents be a computer".&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8695992.stm |title=How scientists made 'artificial life' |accessdate=2010-05-21 | work=BBC News | date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformed bacterium is dubbed "Synthia" by ETC.  A Venter spokesperson has declined to confirm any breakthrough at the time of this writing, likely because similar genetic introduction techniques such as [[transfection]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] and [[protofection]] have been a standard research practice for many years.

Now that the technique has been proven to work with the ''M. mycoides'' genome, the next project is presumably to go back to the minimized ''M. genitalium'' and transplant it into a cell to create the previously mentioned Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The creation of a new synthetic bacterium was announced in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] on March 25, 2016.  It has only 473 genes, the fewest genes of any freely living organism.   
This fast growing new cell, called Syn 3.0, was created by transplanting the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, with all the unessential DNA removed, into a Mycoplasma capricolum, which had been emptied of its own DNA.

M. genitalium was not used because it reproduces too slowly.

==Bacterial genome transplantation==
In order to propagate a synthetic genome, the technique to transplant an intact whole bacterial genome into another had to be developed.
Oswald Avery's pioneering experiments in the 1940s showed that some bacteria could take up naked DNA,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M | title=Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types : Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated From Pneumococcus Type III | journal=J Exp Med | date=Feb 1, 1944 | volume=79| issue=2 |pages=137–58 | doi=10.1084/jem.79.2.137 | pmid=19871359 | pmc=2135445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the advent of [[Molecular cloning|molecular cloning techniques]] DNA elements could be transformed into [[competent cells]], typically [[cloning vectors]], around 5-20 kbp long,  and even [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s can be maintained.
In 2007, Venter's team reported that they had managed to transfer the chromosome of the species ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' to ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' by means of:
* isolating the genome of ''M. mycoides'': gentle lysis of cells trapped in agar—molten agar mixed with cells and left to form a gel—followed by [[PFGE|pulse field gel electrophoresis]] and the band of the correct size (circular 1.25Mbp) being isolated;

The term [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] is used to refer to insertion of a vector into a bacterial cell (by electroporation or heatshock). Here, transplantation is used akin to [[Nuclear transfer|nuclear transplantation]].

The switch from ''M. genitalium'' to ''M. mycoides'' was spurred due to the faster growth of the latter.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt;

==Bacterial chromosome synthesis==
It is possible to create DNA sequences with the use of chemicals ([[oligonucleotide synthesis]]) which is achieved by successive rounds of [[Protective group|deprotection and coupling]] of protected [[Phosphoramidite|phosphoramidite nucleotides]] with geometrically decreasing yields to length, making sequences longer than 1000 base-pairs unfeasible. For longer sequences, DNA ligation is required. In 2008 Venter's group published a paper showing that they had managed to create a synthetic genome (a copy of ''M. mycoides'' sequence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/256384469 CP001621]) by means of a hierarchical strategy:&lt;ref group="a"  name="synthesis"/&gt;
*Synthesis → 1kbp: The genome sequence was synthesized by [http://www.blueheronbio.com/ Blue Heron] in 1078 1080bp cassettes with 80bp overlap and NotI restriction sites (inefficient but rare cutter).
*Ligation → 10kbp: 109 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive cassettes were ligated and cloned in E.coli on a plasmid and the correct permutation checked by sequencing, this would follow a [[geometric distribution]] with expected number of trials of 10.
*Multiplex PCR → 100kbp: 11 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive 10kbp assemblies (grown in yeast) were joined by multiplex PCR, using a primer pair for each 10kbp assembly.
*Isolation and recombination → secondary assemblies were isolated by means of the plug method above and joining and transformed into yeast spheroplasts without a vector sequence (present in assembly 811-900).

==Synthetic genome==

In 2010, using the  methods described above, Venter and colleagues created a strain of Mycoplasma mycoides called '''JCVI-syn1.0''' with a synthetic genome.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibson|first1=D. G.|last2=Glass|first2=J. I.|last3=Lartigue|first3=C.|last4=Noskov|first4=V. N.|last5=Chuang|first5=R.-Y.|last6=Algire|first6=M. A.|last7=Benders|first7=G. A.|last8=Montague|first8=M.

C.|title=Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome|journal=Science|date=20 May 2010|volume=329|issue=5987|pages=52–56|bibcode = 2010Sci...329...52G |doi = 10.1126/science.1190719 | pmid=20488990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the synthetic construct did not work, so to pinpoint the error—which caused a delay of 3 months in the whole project&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt;—a series of semi-synthetic constructs were created. Given the fact that the natural genome worked, the cause of the failed growth was an frameshift mutation in [[DnaA]], a [[Initiation factor|replication initiation factor]], which, once corrected, worked and was verified.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

The construction of a cell with a synthetic genome was done to test the methodology—allowing more modified genomes to be created in the future. To minimize sources of failure, the genome was created using a natural genome as a template. Due to the large size of a genome, apart from the elements required for propagation in yeast and residues from restriction sites, several differences are present in ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' JCVI-syn1.0 notably an ''E.coli'' transposon IS1 (an infection from the 10kb stage) and an 85bp duplication.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

However, the project has received heavy criticism as it claims to have created a synthetic organism. This claim arises from the fact that the genome was synthesized chemically in many pieces (a synthetic method), joined together by means of molecular biological techniques (an artificial method), and transplanted into the cytoplasm of a natural cell (after a few generations, though, the original protein content is undetectable){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.
The two species used as donor and recipient are of the same genus as the more distant two species are, the less the correct protein interactions are maintained, such as binding factors and binding sites, which mutate together ([[epistasis]]).&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povolotskaya | first1 = IS | last2 = Kondrashov | first2 = FA | date = Jun 2010 | title = Sequence space and the ongoing expansion of the protein universe | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7300| pages = 922–6 | doi=10.1038/nature09105 | pmid=20485343| bibcode = 2010Natur.465..922P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Paul Keim]] (a molecular geneticist at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]) notes that "there are great challenges ahead before genetic engineers can mix match, and fully design an organism's genome from scratch" &lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Genomics.

DNA is the template for protein construction and requires proteins as helper molecules to do so, a chicken-and-egg conundrum solved by the [[RNA world hypothesis]], consequently synthetic naked DNA would require several proteins to create a viable cell. In 2000 and 2002 teams synthesized replicating [[hepatitis C virus]] (about 9600 nucleotides long)&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Efficient initiation of HCV RNA replication in cell culture |vauthors=Blight KJ, Kolykhalov AA, Rice CM | journal=Science | date=Dec 8, 2000 | volume=290 | issue=5498 | pages=1972–4| pmid= 11110665|bibcode = 2000Sci...290.1972B |doi = 10.1126/science.290.5498.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[poliovirus]] (about 7500 nucleotides long),&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cello | first1 = J | last2 = Paul | first2 = AV | last3 = Wimmer | first3 = E | date = Aug 2002 | title = Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5583| pages = 1016–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1072266 | pmid=12114528| bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1016C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses, however, replicate by utilising host protein expression machinery. Furthermore, whereas DNA can easily be replicated (using [[DNA polymerase]]), transcribed (using [[RNA polymerase]]), and translated (using [[ribosomes]] and many other factors)—all ''in vitro'', such reactions, so far, use cell extracts and most components have not been synthesized de novo—that is from inorganic or synthetically made organic chemicals only.

===Watermarks===
[[File:Hidden watermark.jpg|thumb|A hidden watermark on a semiconductor chip from 1976, acting as a signature of its creators. In an analogous way, JC Venter and his team added watermarks using [[stop codon]]s to sign their creation.]]
A much publicised feature of the Mycoplasma laboratorium is the presence of watermark sequences as an ultimate proof of the achievement and as a publicity stunt—similar to the tradition of [[chip art]], inscriptions on unused portions of microchips visible only by electron microscopy. The 4 watermarks (present in figure 1 in supplementary material of &lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;) are coded messages in the form of DNA [[base pair]]s, of 1246, 1081, 1109 and 1222 base pairs respectively, in natural [[peptide sequence|peptides]] the 4 [[nucleotide]]s encode in [[codon|sets of 3]] the 20 natural amino acids by means of the [[genetic code|standard genetic code]]. Each amino acid ''by convention'' is represented by a letter, but in nature there is nothing which ties [[alanine]], a molecule, to the Latin letter [[A]], a vowel, so this convention was disregarded in the latter watermarks. In the minimal genome organism the watermark were encoded as amino acids, with [[V]] as [[U]], both in reference to Latin inscriptions and the lack of a standard amino acid for U containing the names of the researchers:
(VENTERINSTITVTE, CRAIGVENTER,  HAMSMITH,  CINDIANDCLYDE,  GLASSANDCLYDE).  In the synthetic organism, instead the Latin alphabet—which in English has 26 letters, which is covered only in base 4 with 3 or more digits—was encoded by an undisclosed encoding. The encoding is fixed and 3 digits make an uppercase letter or {{small caps|Ascii}} symbol, possibly randomly allocated (not [[ASCII table|{{small caps|Ascii}} table]], frequency or [[Keyboard layout|keyboard order]]).&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Shirriff |url=http://www.arcfn.com/2010/06/using-arc-to-decode-venters-secret-dna.html |title=Using Arc to decode Venter's secret DNA watermark |publisher=Ken Shirriff's blog |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the watermarks is as follows:
# watermark 1 an {{Small caps|Html}} script which reads to a browser as  text congratulating the decoder with an email link to click to prove the decoding.
# watermark 2 contains a list of authors and a quote from [[James Joyce]]: "To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life".
# watermark 3 contains more authors and a quote from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (uncredited): "See things not as they are, but as they might be".
# watermark 4 contains yet more authors and a quote from [[Richard Feynman]]: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand".

==Concerns and controversy==

===Press coverage===
The main controversy from the project is the undue amount of publicity it received from the press due to Venter's showmanship, to the degree that [[Jay Keasling]], a pioneering synthetic biologist and founder of Amyris says "The only regulation we need is of my colleague's mouth".&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"&gt;Andrew Pollack, His Corporate Strategy: The Scientific Method, NYTimes, September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
Despite the funding for practical applications, as stressed by [[George M. Church]], one of the main players in the field of synthetic biology, a few changes are required to obtain useful organisms now, such as [[Biofuel from algae|biofuel production]] or [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; However, speculation about the distant future's possible applications is rife.
Venter himself is prone to such speculations, having asked for example, "What if we can make algae taste like beef?"&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; If it were possible to create  a synthetic cell without the use of preexisting recipient cells, however, many applications would become achievable which would be otherwise unattainable, such as a completely overhauled bacterium that works in a logically controlled way—removing what has been described as 'evolutionary messiness'&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tawfik | first1 = Dan S | year = 2010 | title = Messy biology and the origins of evolutionary innovations | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 692–696 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.441 | pmid=20852602}}&lt;/ref&gt;—with lower mutation rates, categorical gene arrangement (colinearity), the possibility of adding [[Nucleic acid analogues|novel nucleotides]] to increase encoding (a feat achieved in vitro (PCR)); or with a completely novel genetic code, such as has been achieved by experiments in which a few [[Expanded genetic code|additional non-canonical amino acids]] were added.

In [[biology]], an '''organism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'') is any individual [[entity]] that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. It is a synonym for "[[Outline of life forms|life form]]".

Organisms are classified by [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] into specified groups such as the [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[fungi]]; or [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microorganism]]s such as a [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=RS.|title=A dictionary of biology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|page=461|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All types of organisms are capable of [[reproduction]], [[Developmental biology|growth and development]], [[homeostasis|maintenance]], and some degree of response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[Human]]s are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] during [[developmental biology|development]] into specialized [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

An organism may be either a [[prokaryote]] or a [[eukaryote]]. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate [[Three-domain system|domains]]—[[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound [[cell nucleus]] and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called [[organelle]]s (such as [[mitochondria]] in animals and plants and [[plastid]]s in plants and [[algae]], all generally considered to be derived from [[symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic]] bacteria).&lt;ref name=cavaliersmith1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cavalier-Smith T.| year = 1987| title = The origin of eukaryotic and archaebacterial cells| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 503| issue =| pages = 17–54| pmid = 3113314| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb40596.x| bibcode = 1987NYASA.503...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, animals and plants are examples of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of organisms within the eukaryotes.

==Etymology==
The term "organism" (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'', from ὄργανον, ''organon'', i.e. "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|o)/rganon|ὄργανον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=organism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=organism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings, going back at least to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I., [[Critique of Judgment]]: §64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
An organism may be defined as an assembly of [[molecule]]s functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |edition=online |date=1999 |title=organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many definitions exclude [[virus]]es and possible man-made [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic life]] forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|organism|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[superorganism]] is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or [[social unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-cellular life===
{{main|Non-cellular life}}
[[Virus]]es are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous [[reproduction]], growth or [[metabolism]]. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but are capable of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few [[enzyme]]s and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the [[cell (biology)|host cell]]. In this sense, they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not classified as organisms, they do have their own [[gene]]s, and they do [[evolution|evolve]] by mechanisms similar to the evolutionary mechanisms of organisms.

The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate.&lt;ref name="10reasons" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moreira | first1 = D. | last2 = López-García | first2 = P. N. | title = Ten reasons to exclude viruses from the tree of life | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2108 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | year = 2009 | pmid = 19270719| pmc = | volume=7 | issue = 4 | pages=306–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the [[tree of life]]. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through [[horizontal gene transfer]] from viral hosts.&lt;ref name="10reasons" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern [[Biochemistry|the chemical processes of life]]. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their [[DNA]]-based genes.

Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of [[chemical compound]]s that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.

Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. [[Autotroph]]s produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while [[heterotroph]]s take in organic compounds from the environment.

The primary [[chemical element]] in these compounds is [[carbon]]. The [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as [[carbon dioxide]]), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ([[nucleic acid]]s), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).

===Macromolecules===
Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into [[macromolecule]]s and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are [[nucleic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of [[nucleotide]]s. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]]) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into [[codon]]s, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular [[amino acid]]. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, [[protein folding|folds]] in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.

These protein functions have been recognized:
# [[Enzyme]]s, which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism
# Structural proteins, such as [[tubulin]], or [[collagen]]
# Regulatory proteins, such as [[transcription factor]]s or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle
# Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some [[hormone]]s and their receptors
# Defensive proteins, which can include everything from [[Antibody|antibodies]] of the [[immune system]], to toxins (e.g., [[dendrotoxin]]s of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like [[canavanine]]

A bilayer of [[phospholipid]]s makes up the [[phospholipid membrane|membrane]] of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.

==Structure==
All organisms consist of structural units called [[cell (biology)|cells]]; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely [[epithelium]], [[nervous tissue]], [[muscle tissue]], and [[connective tissue]]. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the [[heart]], or as a barrier to the environment as the [[skin]]). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an [[organ system]] such as the [[reproductive system]], and [[digestive system]]. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.

===Cell===
The [[cell theory]], first developed in 1839 by [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]], states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; and cells contain the [[genetics|hereditary information]] necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.

There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a [[nuclear membrane]] so [[DNA]] is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.

All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a [[cell membrane|membrane]], which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells.

All cells share several similar characteristics of:&lt;ref name="AlbertsCh1"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=%22all+cells%22+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372023%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.4#23 The Universal Features of Cells on Earth] in Chapter 1 of ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=cell+biology+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+373693%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4 Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use of enzymes and other proteins [[genetic code|coded]] by DNA genes and made via [[messenger RNA]] intermediates and [[ribosome]]s.
* Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, [[molecule]]s and releasing [[by-product]]s. The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from [[metabolic pathway]]s.

* Cell contents are contained within a [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] that contains proteins and a [[lipid bilayer]].

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including [[geology]] and [[planetary science]]. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of [[time]].

All organisms are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.

There is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of [[nucleic acid]]s as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty [[amino acid]]s as the building blocks for [[protein]]s. All organisms use the same [[genetic code]] (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to [[translation (genetics)|translate]] nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

Research published in 2016, by [[William F. Martin]], by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results "depict LUCA as [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent with a [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway]] (the reductive [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl-coenzyme A]] pathway), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon [[transition metals]], [[Flavin mononucleotide|flavins]], [[S-adenosyl methionine]], [[coenzyme A]], [[ferredoxin]], [[molybdopterin]], [[corrin]]s and [[selenium]]. Its genetic code required [[nucleoside]] modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent [[methylation]]s." The results depict [[methanogen]]ic [[clostridium|clostria]] as a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and suggest that the LUCA inhabited an anaerobic [[hydrothermal vent]] setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and iron.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;"[http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016116 The physiology and habitat of the last universal common ancestor]" by Madeline C.

In prokaryotes, [[Transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural bacterial transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of [[natural competence]] to perform this complex process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen I |author2=Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat.

===Horizontal gene transfer===
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}
The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sequence comparisons suggest recent [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] of many genes among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma State – [https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biologist Peter Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Gogarten |url=http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 |title=Horizontal Gene Transfer - A New Paradigm for Biology |publisher=esalenctr.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms)===
Modern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organism and species. [[Cloning]] is the process of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another, with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Cloning is the subject of [[ethics of cloning|much ethical debate]].

In 2008, the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] assembled a synthetic [[Bacterial genome size|bacterial genome]], ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. ''The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments.''&lt;ref name=Venter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibsona, Daniel G. |author2=Benders, Gwynedd A. |author3=Axelroda, Kevin C. |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=One-step assembly in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments to form a complete synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20404–20409 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20404.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811011106 |pmid=19073939 |pmc=2600582|bibcode=2008PNAS..10520404G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, such as [[Synthetic Genomics]], have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Parent–offspring conflict''' ('''POC''') is an expression coined in 1974 by [[Robert Trivers]]. It is used to describe the [[evolutionary conflict]] arising from differences in optimal [[parental investment]] (PI) in an offspring from the standpoint of the [[parent]] and the [[offspring]]. PI is any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that decreases the parent's ability to invest in other offspring, while the selected offspring's chance of surviving increases.

POC occurs in sexually reproducing species and is based on a genetic conflict: Parents are equally related to each of their offspring and are therefore expected to equalize their investment among them. Offspring are only half or less related to their [[sibling]]s (and fully related to themselves), so they try to get more PI than the parents intended to provide even at their siblings' disadvantage. 
However, POC is limited by the close genetic relationship between parent and offspring: If an offspring obtains additional PI at the expense of its siblings, it decreases the number of its surviving siblings. Therefore, any [[gene]] in an offspring that leads to additional PI decreases (to some extent) the number of surviving copies of itself that may be located in siblings. Thus, if the costs in siblings are too high, such a gene might be selected against despite the benefit to the offspring. 
The problem of specifying how an individual is expected to weigh a relative against itself has been examined by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in the context of [[kin selection]]. [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's rule]] says that [[altruistic behavior]] will be positively selected if the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the performer is greater than the cost to the performer of a social act. Conversely, selfish behavior can only be favoured when Hamilton's inequality is not satisfied. This leads to the prediction that, other things being equal, POC will be stronger under half siblings (e.g., unrelated males father a female's successive offspring) than under full siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | authorlink = Robert Trivers | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = Am.

==Occurrence==

===In plants===
In [[plants]], POC over the allocation of resources to the brood members may affect both brood size (number of [[seed]]s matured within a single fruit) and seed size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sadras | first1 = V.O. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R.F. | year = 2009 | title = Do plant parts compete for resources? An evolutionary perspective | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 565–574 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02848.x | pmid = 19413690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning brood size, the most economic use of maternal resources is achieved by packing as many seeds as possible in one fruit, i.e., minimizing the cost of packing per seed. In contrast, offspring benefeits from low numbers of seeds per fruit, which reduces sibling competition before and after dispersal. Conflict over seed size arises because there usually exists an inverse exponential relationship between seed size and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the fitness of a seed increases at a diminishing rate with resource investment but the fitness of the maternal parent has an optimum, as demonstrated by Smith and Fretwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Fretwell | first2 = S.D. | year = 1974 | title = The optimal balance between size and number of offspring | url = | journal = Am. Nat. | volume = 108 | issue = 962| pages = 499–506 | doi = 10.1086/282929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[marginal value theorem]]). However, the optimum resource investment from the offspring's point of view would be the maximum that it can possibly get from the maternal parent.

This conflict about resource allocation is most obviously manifested in the reduction of brood size (i.e. a decrease in the proportion of [[ovule]]s matured into seeds). Such reduction can be assumed to be caused by the offspring: If the maternal parent's interest were to produce as few seeds as observed, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] would not favour the production of extra ovules that do not mature into seeds. (Although other explanations for this phenomenon exist, such as [[genetic load]], resource depletion or maternal regulation of offspring quality, they could not be supported by experiments.)

There are several possibilities how the offspring can affect paternal resource allocation to brood members. Evidence exists for [[siblicide]] by dominant embryos: Embryos formed early kill the remaining embryos through an aborting chemical. In oaks, early fertilized ovules prevent the [[fertilization]] of other ovules by inhibiting the [[pollen tube]] entry into the [[embryo sac]]. In some species, the maternal parent has evolved postfertilization [[abortion]] of few seeded pods. Nevertheless, cheating by the offspring is also possible here, namely by late siblicide, when the postfertilization abortion has ceased.

According to the general POC model, reduction of brood size – if caused by POC – should depend on genetic relatedness between offspring in a fruit. Indeed, abortion of embryos is more common in [[out-crossing]] than in [[self-pollinating]] plants (seeds in cross-pollinating plants are less related than in self-pollinating plants). Moreover, the level of solicitation of resources by the offspring is also increased in cross-pollinating plants: There are several reports that the average weight of crossed seeds is greater than of seeds produced by self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uma Shaanker | first1 = R. | last2 = Ganeshaiah | first2 = K.N. | last3 = Bawa | first3 = K.S. | year = 1988 | title = Parent-offspring conflict, sibling rivalry, and brood size patterns in plants | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 177–205 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
Some of the earliest examples of parent-offspring conflict were seen in [[bird]] broods and especially in [[raptor birds|raptor]] species. While parent birds often lay two eggs and attempt to raise two or more young, the strongest fledgling takes a greater share of the food brought by parents and will often kill the weaker sibling ([[siblicide]]). Such conflicts have been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of optimal [[clutch size]] in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = H. | last3 = Stinson | first3 = C.H. | year = 1990 | title = Avian siblicide | url = | journal = Am. Sci. | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 438–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[blue-footed booby]], parent-offspring conflict results in times of food scarcity. When there is less food available in a given year, the older, dominant chick will often kill the younger chick by either attacking directly, or by driving it from the nest. Parents try to prevent siblicide by building nests with steeper sides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David J.|title=The Role of Parents in Siblicidal Brood Reduction of Two Booby Species|journal=The Auk|year=1995|volume=112|issue=4|pages=860–869|doi=10.2307/4089018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by laying heavier second eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Alba|first=Liliana |author2=Roxana Torres |author3=G.R. Bortolotti|title=Seasonal Egg-Mass Variation and Laying Sequence in a Bird with Facultative Brood Reductions|journal=The Auk|year=2007|volume=124|issue=2|pages=643–652|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[643:sevals]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
Even before POC theory arose, debates took place over whether [[infant]]s [[wean]] themselves or mothers actively wean their infants. Furthermore, it was discussed whether maternal rejections increase infant independence. It turned out that both mother and infant contribute to infant independence. Maternal rejections can be followed by a short-term increase in infant contact but they eventually result in a long-term decrease of contact as has been shown for several primates: In wild [[baboon]]s infants that are rejected early and frequently spend less time in contact whereas those that are not rejected stay much longer in the proximity of their mother and suckle or ride even in advanced ages. In wild [[chimpanzee]]s an abrupt increase in maternal rejections and a decrease in mother-offspring contact is found when mothers resume [[Estrus#Estrus|estrus]] and consort with males. In [[rhesus macaque]]s a high probability of conception in the following mating season is associated with a high rate of maternal rejection. Rejection and behavioral conflicts can occur during the first months of an infant's life and when the mother resumes estrus. These findings suggest that the [[reproduction]] of the mother is influenced by the interaction with their offspring. So there is a potential for conflicts over PI.
It was also observed in rhesus macaques that the number of contacts made by offspring is significantly higher than the number of contacts made by mother during a mating season, whereas the opposite holds for the number of broken contacts. This fact suggests that the mother resists offspring's demands for contact, whereas offspring is apparently more interested in spending time in contact. At three months of infant age a shift from mother to infant in responsibility for maintaining contact takes place. So when the infant becomes more independent, its effort to maintain proximity to its mother increases. This might sound paradoxical but becomes clear when one takes into account that POC increases during the period of PI. In summary, all these findings are consistent with POC-theory.

One might object that time in contact is not a reasonable measure for PI and that, for example, time for milk transfer ([[lactation]]) would be a better one. Here one can argue that mother and infant have different [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] needs due to the fact that they have different surface-to-volume ratios resulting in more rapid loss of heat in infants compared to adults. So infants may be more sensitive to low temperatures than their mothers. An infant might try to compensate by increased contact time with their mother, which could initiate a behavioral conflict over time. Consistency of this hypothesis has been shown for [[Japanese macaque]]s where decreasing temperatures result in higher maternal rejections and increased number of contacts made by infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestripieri | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Parent-offspring conflict in primates | url = | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 923–951 | doi=10.1023/a:1015537201184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In social insects===

In eusocial species, the parent-offspring conflict takes on a unique role because of [[haplodiploidy]] and the prevalence of sterile workers. Sisters are more related to each other (0.75) than to their mothers (0.5) or brothers (0.25). In most cases, this drives female workers to try and obtain a sex ratio of 3:1 (females to males) in the colony. However, queens are equally related to both sons and daughters, so they prefer a sex ratio of 1:1. The conflict in social insects is about the level investment the queen should provide for each sex for current and future offspring. It is generally thought that workers will win this conflict and the sex ratio will be closer to 3:1, however there are examples, like in ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', where the queen has considerable control in forcing a 1:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bourke, A.F.G. and F.L.W. Ratnieks | year = 2001 | title = Kin-selected conflict in the bumble-bee ''Bombus terrestris'' (Hymenoptera: Apidae) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 268 | pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1381 | pmid=11270430 | pmc=1088613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
An important illustration of such conflict is provided by David Haig’s (1993) work on genetic conflicts in pregnancy. Haig has argued that [[fetus|fetal]] genes would be selected to draw more resources from the mother than it would be optimal for the mother to give, a hypothesis that has received empirical support. The [[placenta]], for example, secretes allocrine [[hormone]]s that decrease the sensitivity of the mother to [[insulin]] and thus make a larger supply of blood sugar available to the fetus. The mother responds by increasing the level of insulin in her bloodstream, and to counteract this effect the placenta has insulin receptors that stimulate the production of insulin-degrading [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haig | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Haig (biologist) | year = 1993 | title = Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy | url = | journal = Quart. Rev. Biol. | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 495–532 | doi = 10.1086/418300 | pmid = 8115596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30 percent of human [[fertilisation|conceptions]] do not progress to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3393170 | doi=10.1056/NEJM198807283190401 | volume=319 | title=Incidence of early loss of pregnancy | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=189–94 | last1 = Wilcox | first1 = AJ | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = CR | last3 = O'Connor | first3 = JF | last4 = Baird | first4 = DD | last5 = Schlatterer | first5 = JP | last6 = Canfield | first6 = RE | last7 = Armstrong | first7 = EG | last8 = Nisula | first8 = BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this creates a second arena for conflict between the mother and the fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for [[spontaneous abortion]] than the mother. The mother's quality cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone [[progesterone]], but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in [[hypertension]] and, significantly, high [[birth weight]] is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.

After birth the young infant may demand more nutritional resources than the lactating mother is prepared to provide, and the presence of [[benzodiazepine]]-like compounds in [[breast milk]] may function to keep this in check, although its primary function is to calm the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dencker |first1=SJ |title=Quantification of naturally occurring benzodiazepine-like substances in human breast milk. |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=1589563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A tripartite (fetus–mother–father) immune conflict in humans and other placentals===
{{further|Microchimerism#Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict|l1=Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict}}

During pregnancy, there is a two-way traffic of immunologically active cell lines through the placenta. Fetal [[lymphocyte]] lines may survive in women even decades after giving birth. These cells may serve the adaptive interest of the mother, however, they may also serve conflicting interests of the fetus or those of the father. This mixture of shared or contradicting interests has been hypothesized as giving rise to diseases like autoimmune diseases, infertility, and habitual abortion in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Apari P, Rózsa L| title=The tripartite immune conflict in placentals and a hypothesis on fetal→maternal Microchimerism| format=pdf| journal=Medical Hypotheses| year=2009| volume=72|pages= 52–54|pmid= 18930355|issue= 1|doi= 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.08.021| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/microchimerism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal experience''' of a [[human being]] is the moment-to-moment [[experience]] and [[sensory awareness]] of internal and external [[event (philosophy)|events]] or a sum of experiences forming an empirical unity such as a period of life.

==History==
An early belief of some philosophers of [[Ancient Greece]] was that the [[mind]] was like a [[Analog recording|recording]] device and simply kept somehow-objective records of what the [[senses]] experienced. This was believed in the Western world into the 20th century until [[cognitive psychology]] experiments decisively proved that it was not true, and that many events were simply filled in by the mind, based on what "should be". This, among other things, explained why [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of events often were so widely varied.

In [[Ancient Rome]] it was believed that personal experience was part of some divine or species-wide [[collective experience]]. This gave rise to notions of [[racial memory]], [[national mission]], and such notions as [[racism]] and [[patriotism]]. It was likely easier to create [[political movement]]s and military morale with such notions, than a strictly personal idea of experience. [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] were notable investigators of these ideas of collective experience in the 20th century.

During [[the Enlightenment]], there was rigorous investigation of these ideas. [[Immanuel Kant]] noted that it was only possible to explain "experience and its objects" as a consequence of each other: either experience makes those objects possible, or those objects make experience possible. This is seen today as [[Epistemological dualism|dualism]], and denying the possibility of a third thing making both experience and whatever reality its objects have, both possible. That thing could be a more universal [[cognition]], as proposed in some versions of [[Christianity]] or [[Gaia philosophy]].

'''Peter Aaby''' ([[Danes|Danish]], born 1944 in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]]) is trained as an [[anthropologist]] but also holds a [[doctoral degree]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Winkel, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkel|first1=Klaus|title=Danskere i tropisk Afrika : fra slavehandler til bistandsarbejder|date=2011|publisher=Klim|location=Århus|isbn=8779559271|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Peter Aaby established the [[Bandim Health Project]], a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[West Africa]], which he has run ever since.&lt;ref name="Bandim, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://bandim.org/about-bhp/background.aspx|website=Bandim Health Project|publisher=SSI|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Peter Aaby was awarded the [[Novo Nordisk]] Prize, the most important Danish award within [[Outline of health sciences|health research]].

[[File:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the  miracle leaf plant (''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''). The small plant in front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) tall. The concept of "individual" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]
'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].

In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.

==Asexual==
{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}
Asexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of "splitting" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.

Some species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].

Other ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some
[[reptile]]s,&lt;ref name="reptiles"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles &amp; Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986

It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.

==Sexual==
{{Main article|Sexual reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}} 
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating in midair flight]]
Sexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called "plus" and "minus" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 79, No. 3 (Sep. 30, 1938), pp. 411-434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more than two  "sexes", called [[syngen]]s.
Most [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" where recombination occurs freely.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Otto and D. B. Goldstein. "Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy". [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]. Vol 131 (1992): 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE. (1987) The molecular basis of the evolution of sex. ''Adv Genet.'' '''24''':323-370. Review. {{PMID|3324702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.

===Allogamy===
{{Main article|Allogamy}}
Allogamy is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)

===Autogamy===
{{main article|Autogamy}}
Self-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term "autogamy" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532–542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.

===Mitosis and meiosis===
[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].

'''Mitosis'''
The resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] --&gt;
'''Meiosis'''
The resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell. A [[diploid]] cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions ([[tetraploid]] to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four [[haploid]] cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.

==Same-sex==
In recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/timeline.htm |title=Timeline of same-sex procreation scientific developments |publisher=samesexprocreation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are [[female sperm]] and [[male egg]]s, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. "However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis."&lt;ref name="chicken sperm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9227893|title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads|publisher= | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x|volume=39|issue=3|date=June 1997|pages=267–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Washington Post |date=April 22, 2004 |title=Japanese scientists produce mice without using sperm |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wYQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6950,1352704&amp;dq=japanese+scientists+combine+two+mouse+eggs+to+produce+daughter+mice&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-father-necessary-as-mice-are-created-with-two-mothers-2vskf8w58|title=No father necessary as mice are created with two mothers|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|date=2018-10-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=2018-10-01|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.

===Other types===
{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}
* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.
* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].
* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].

==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.

When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]] and Bernstein et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H., Bernstein C. and Michod R.E. (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19: 357-382 in ''DNA Repair'', Inna Kruman (Ed.), InTech (publisher) {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}}. Available online from [http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair intechopen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.

==Life without==
The existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].

Scientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12114528&amp;dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]&lt;br/&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no [[metabolism]] and can only [[self-replication|replicate]] with the assistance of a hijacked [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s metabolic machinery.

The production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A [[Synthetic Genomics|synthetic genome]] has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new ''[[M. mycoides]]'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1190719| pmid = 20488990| year = 2010| last1 = Gibson | first1 = D.| last2 = Glass | first2 = J.| last3 = Lartigue | first3 = C.| last4 = Noskov | first4 = V.| last5 = Chuang | first5 = R.| last6 = Algire | first6 = M.| last7 = Benders | first7 = G.| last8 = Montague | first8 = M.| last9 = Ma | first9 = L.| last10 = Moodie | first10 = M.

There is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic&lt;ref name="venter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984|title=Scientists Create First Synthetic Cell|author=Robert Lee Hotz|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term "synthetic bacterial cell" but they also clarify "...we do not consider this to be "creating life from scratch" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq |title=FAQ |author=Craig Venter Institute |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions".&lt;ref name="venter"/&gt; Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield "truly programmable organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = W. Wayte Gibbs | title = Synthetic Life | journal = Scientific American | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=synthetic-life| date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3214/01.html |title= NOVA: Artificial life |accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lottery principle==
Sexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of "winning" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">[[File:Selection shadow.svg|thumb|'''(a)''' The survival rate of a population decreases as individuals age, but the reproduction rate remains constant. '''(b)''' The reproduction probability peaks early in life at sexual maturity and then steadily decreases as an individual ages, with the remaining share of the population decreasing with age as they enter the selection shadow.]]
The '''selection shadow''' is a concept involved with the [[Senescence#Evolutionary theories|evolutionary theories of ageing]] that states that [[selection pressures]] on an individual decrease as an individual ages and passes [[sexual maturity]], resulting in a "shadow" of time where [[selective fitness]] is not considered. Over generations, this results in maladaptive mutations that accumulate later in life due to aging being non-adaptive toward reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; The concept was first worked out by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Peter Medawar]] in the 1940s, with Medawar creating the first [[graphical model]].&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151 |title=The Evolution of Aging |last1=Fabian |first1=Daniel |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |date=2011 |website=[[Scitable]] |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model developed by Medawar states that due to the dangerous conditions and pressures from the environment, including predators and diseases, most individuals in the wild die not long after sexual maturity. Therefore, there is a low probability for individuals to survive to an advanced age and suffer the effects related to [[aging]]. In conjunction with this, the effects of natural selection decrease as age increases, so that later individual performance is ignored by selection forces.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; This results in beneficial [[mutations]] not being selected for if they only have a positive result later in life, along with later in life deleterious mutations not being selected against. Due to the fitness of an individual not being affected once it is past its reproductive prime, later mutations and effects are considered to be in the "shadow" of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flatt |first=Thomas |last2=Schmidt |first2=Paul S. |date=July 18, 2009 |title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging |url=http://i122server.vu-wien.ac.at/pop/Flatt_website/FlattSchmidt09.pdf |journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=1790 |issue=10 |pages=951–962 |doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010 |accessdate=May 20, 2014|pmc=2972575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept would later be adapted into Medawar's 1952 [[Evolution of ageing#Mutation accumulation|mutation accumulation hypothesis]], which was itself expanded upon by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his 1957 [[antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

A classical requirement and [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] of the model is that the number of individuals within a population that live to reach [[senescence]] must be small in number. If this is not true for a population, then the effects of old age will not be under a selection shadow and instead affect adaptation and evolution of the population as a whole. At the same time, however, this requirement has been challenged by increasing evidence of senescence being more common in wild populations than previously expected, especially among birds and mammals, while the effects of the selection shadow remain present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turbill |first=Christopher |last2=Ruf |first2=Thomas |date=August 6, 2010 |title=Senescence Is More Important in the Natural Lives of Long- Than Short-Lived Mammals |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |publisher=[[Public Library of Science]] |volume=5 |issue=8 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012019 |pmid=20700508 |pmc=2917356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some scientists, however, have criticized the idea of aging being non-adaptive, instead adopting the theory of "[[Death by Design]]". This theory follows the work of [[August Weismann]], which states that aging specifically evolved as an [[adaptation]], and disagrees with Medawar's model as a perceived oversimplification of the impact older organisms have on evolution. It is also claimed that older organisms have a higher reproductive capacity due to being better fit in order to reach their age, rather than their capacity being equal as in Medawar's calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lachowicz |first=Miroslaw |last2=Miękisz |first2=Jacek |date=April 20, 2009 |title=From Genetics to Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7n18NlBYSoC&amp;dq |location=[[Singapore]] |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |page=39 |isbn=9812837256 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steinar Aadnekvam''' (born 4 April 1984 in [[Bergen, Norway]]), is a Norwegian jazz guitarist.&lt;ref name=dolajazz&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://dolajazz.no/events/freedom-trio | title=Freedoms trio | publisher=Dolajazz.no | accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Aadnekvam got his first guitar at the age of 4, and found comfort in playing while growing up in different towns and cities in Norway, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden. By the age of 9 he was composing music and listening to artists like [[Elvis Presley]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. As teenager his interest turned to Jazz when discovering artists like Charlie Parker, John McLaughlin, Miles Davis, Rhasaan Roland Kirk, Abdullah Ibrahim and later composers like [[Egberto Gismonti]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Indian classical]] music among others.

After musical studies at [[Södra Latins gymnasium]], followed by studies at the [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm]], Sweden, with notable teachers at this time including Mikke Rönnkvist, Thomas Wixtröm, [[Andreas Oberg]], Alvaro Is Rojas and Sten Hostfalt. Aadnekvam turned his curiosity outwards as he decided to travel to [[Mumbai, India]] for studies with classical Indian master flutist [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]] at his intern school Vrindaban Gurukul. Soon after fate would also have him make his first travel to north-eastern Brasil, an acquaintance that made an even deeper impact on him and for almost a decade he now finds his second home in the state of Pernambuco where two of his albums have been recorded collaborating with some of the regions finest musicians.

In 2009 Aadnekvam was nominated for the 'Young Nordic Guitarist Award' by the [[Uppsala International Guitar Festival]],&lt;ref name=kulturalna&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.kulturalna.warszawa.pl/events,1,53334,Steinar_Aadnekvam_Quartet_ndash%3B_concert_within_the_Internat....html?locale=en_GB | title=Steinar Aadnekvam Quartet – concert within the International Jazz in Old Town - Summer Festival | publisher=Kulturalna.Warszawa.pl |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 finalist at the 'Norsk JazzIntro' at [[Moldejazz]]&lt;ref name=ballade&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ballade.no/sak/atte-band-klare-for-jazzintro | title=Åtte band klare for Jazzintro | language=Norwegian | publisher=Ballade.no | date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; he started his own record label 'MMYH Records' (Music Makes You Happy) with his debut album ''Simple Things'' (2010).&lt;ref name=jazznytt&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://jazznytt.jazzinorge.no/2011/01/12/steinar-aadnekvam-2 | title=Anmeldelser Steinar Aadnekvam | language=Norwegian | first=Tonje | last=Johansson | publisher=JazzINorge.no | date=2011-01-12 | accessdate=2017-01-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110090609/http://jazznytt.jazzinorge.no/2011/01/12/steinar-aadnekvam-2/ | archivedate=2017-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he played feature concerts at clubs and major jazz festivals in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Poland and Romania and later turned to working on his two Brazilian album collaborations ''Abacaxeiro'' and 'Ecology' and extensive concert touring, masterclasses, tv appearances and radio broadcasts related to these in the Nordics and in Brasil.&lt;ref name=kulturalna/&gt;

In 2015 Aadnekvam signed for the Norwegian label [[Losen Records]] for his fourth studio album ''Freedoms Tree'' (2015), featuring an international all-star ensemble including several outstanding musical guests. The album turned out to be a great success and the full 7 piece ensemble will present a concert at the 2016 Stavanger International Jazz Festival, [[MaiJazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://maijazz.no/artister/steinar-aadnekvam | title=Steinar Aadnekvam | language=Norwegian | first=Per Hasse | last=Andersen | publisher=[[MaiJazz]] | date=2016-05-03 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration with Losen Records continued with the release of the album ''Freedoms Trio'' (2016), witch also names his new collaboration and working band featuring bassistand vocalist Rubem Farias from São Paulo, Brasil and drummer and singer Deodato Siquir from Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref name=dolajazz/&gt;

|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Terror management theory''' ('''TMT''') is an [[evolutionary psychology]] theory originally proposed by [[Jeff Greenberg]], [[Sheldon Solomon]], and [[Tom Pyszczynski]]&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; and codified in their book ''The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life'' (2015). It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a [[self-preservation]] instinct whilst realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, and the terror is then managed by embracing cultural values, or symbolic systems that act to provide life with enduring meaning and value.&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Greenberg, J., Pyszczynski, T. &amp; Solomon, S. (1986). "The causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem: A terror management theory". In R.F. Baumeister (ed.), ''Public Self and Private Self'' (pp. 189-212). Springer-Verlag (New York).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GPS91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = S. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 93| page = 159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Examples of cultural values that impact an individual's terror of death are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g. belief in afterlife, religion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonas | first1 = E. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Terror management and religion: evidence that intrinsic religiousness mitigates worldview defense following mortality salience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 553–567 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.3.553 | pmid=16938037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, TMT also argues that other cultural values&amp;nbsp;– including those that are seemingly unrelated to death&amp;nbsp;– offer symbolic immortality.  For example, values of national identity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; posterity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = X. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Chen | first3 = C. | last4 = Yu | first4 = Z. | year = 2008 | title = Do children transcend death?

L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J.

L. 2000"/&gt; have  been linked to death concerns.  In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g. country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Because cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for [[self-esteem]]. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values.&lt;ref name=GPS91/&gt;

TMT is derived from [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ernest Becker]]'s 1973&amp;nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work of nonfiction ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound&amp;nbsp;– albeit subconscious&amp;nbsp;– anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, [[religion and happiness|religious meaning systems]], cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural [[worldview]]. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety.

==Background==
{{Quote box
 | width = 30%
 | quote  = ''The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity—activity designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny for man.''
| source = Ernest Becker, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologist]] Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973&amp;nbsp;book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, pp. ix–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker expounded upon the previous writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Norman&amp;nbsp;O.&amp;nbsp;Brown]], and [[Otto Rank]]. According to clinical psychiatrist [[Morton Levitt]], Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Morton (July 1974). "Reviewed work(s): The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 414, USA-USSR: Agenda for Communication, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

People desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in [[psychology]] known as [[self-esteem]]. This feeling counters the [[cognitive dissonance]] created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: {{blockquote|the problem of heroics is the central one of human life, that it goes deeper into human nature than anything else because it is based on organismic [[narcissism]] and on the child's need for self-esteem as ''the'' condition for his life. Society itself is a codified hero system, which means that society everywhere is a living myth of the significance of human life, a defiant creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in [[Psychological Review]] proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health-promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: "''Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.''"&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Arndt | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = The Implications of death for health: A terror management health model for behavioral health promotion | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 1032–1053 | doi=10.1037/a0013326| pmid = 18954213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary backdrop===
Terror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the [[theory of evolution]]:&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human [[bipedalism]] confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers.

Anxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]] in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective.

Hunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror.

Originally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, [[Neanderthal]]s might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, [[funeral]]s are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead.

Evolutionary history also indicates that "the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook Of Experimental Existential Psychology|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_KMRe9wK2MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=2013-08-18|chapter=Paradise Lost and Reclaimed|last1=Koole|first1=Sander L.|last2=van den Berg|first2=Agnes E.|editor1-last=Greenberg|editor1-first=Jeff|editor2-last=Koole|editor2-first=Sander L.|editor3-last=Pyszczynski|editor3-first=Tom|year=2004|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59385-040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well-being.

==Self-esteem==
[[Self-esteem]] lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from [[Ernest Becker]]'s conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1971). The birth and death of meaning (2nd ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1973). ''The Denial of Death'' (1st ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain ''why'' we need self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., Solomon, S., Arndt, J. &amp; Schimel, J.
 | year = 2004
 | title = Why do people need self-esteem? A theoretical and empirical review
 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | number=130 | pages=435–468 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.435
 | pmid = 15122930
 | volume=130
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview.&lt;ref name = "self-esteem"/&gt;

Critically, Hewstone ''et al.'' (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death-anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Hew&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = M. | last3 = Willis | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Intergroup bias | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 575–604 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109 | pmid = 11752497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.&lt;ref name="Hew"/&gt;

Research has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health.&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Cox | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Goldenberg | first3 = J. L. | last4 = Vess | first4 = M. | last5 = Routledge | first5 = C. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = D. P. | last7 = Cohen | first7 = F. | year = 2009 | title = Blowing in the (social) wind: Implications of extrinsic esteem contingencies for terror management and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 1191–1205 | doi = 10.1037/a0015182 | pmid=19469596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;  Specifically, Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;

===Self-esteem as anxiety buffer===
An individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be [[diminishing returns]] from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taubman-Ben-Ari | first1 = O. | last2 = Noy | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Self-consciousness and death cognitions from a terror management perspective | url = | journal = Death Studies | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 871–892 | doi = 10.1080/07481187.2010.496685 | pmid = 24482853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | last2 = Winzeler | first2 = S. | last3 = Topolinski | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = When the death makes you smoke: A terror management perspective on the effectiveness of cigarette on-pack warnings | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates [[cognitive dissonance]] regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause [[negative reinforcement]] that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

==Mortality salience==
The [[mortality salience]] hypothesis&amp;nbsp;(MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self-esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS&amp;nbsp;paradigm, these "threats" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;asking participants to write about their own death;&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Wicklund | first2 = R.

Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS&amp;nbsp;research, see Burke ''et al.'' (2010).&lt;ref name = Burke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burke | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Martens | first2 = A. | last3 = Faucher | first3 = E. H. | year = 2010 | title = Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research | url = | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 155–195 | doi=10.1177/1088868309352321 | pmid=20097885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentally, the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis has been tested in close to 200&amp;nbsp;empirical articles.&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt; After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs.&amp;nbsp;a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Green 1994"/&gt; for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, Greenberg ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Rosenblatt | first4 = A. | last5 = Veeder | first5 = M. | last6 = Kirkland | first6 = S. | last7 = Lyon | first7 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Evidence for terror management&amp;nbsp;II: The effects of mortality salience on reactions to those who threaten or bolster the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 308–318 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.2.308| citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.2378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS&amp;nbsp;induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition.&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Simon | first2 = L. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Pyszczynski | first4 = T. | last5 = Solomon | first5 = S. | last6 = McGregor | first6 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24| pmid = 9008372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

Mortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox ''et al.'' (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = D. P. | last3 = Vess | first3 = M. | last4 = Arndt | first4 = J. | last5 = Goldenberg | first5 = J. L. | last6 = Routledge | first6 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Bronze is beautiful but pale can be pretty: The effects of appearance standards and mortality salience on sun-tanning outcomes | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 746–752 | doi = 10.1037/a0016388 | pmid = 19916643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death dealing with the fear of public speaking.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that "bronze is beautiful," one relating to the idea that "pale is pretty," and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun-tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

===Mortality and self-esteem on health risks===
Studies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jessop | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Albery | first2 = I. P. | last3 = Rutter | first3 = J. | last4 = Garrod | first4 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Understanding the impact of mortality-related health-risk information: A terror management theory perspective | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 7| pages = 951–964 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208316790 | pmid = 18453389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Overall, Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Self-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

In the Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self-esteem.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second, control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels.

===Social impacts===
Many people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Kamins | first2 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An application of terror management theory in the design of social and health-related anti-smoking appeals | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Behaviour | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 172–190 | doi = 10.1002/cb.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self-esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions.  In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem.  Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;  In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

==Death thought accessibility==
Another paradigm that TMT&amp;nbsp;researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility&amp;nbsp;(DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA&amp;nbsp;hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened.&lt;ref name = "Hayes" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = J. | last2 = Schimel | first2 = J. | last3 = Ardnt | first3 = J. | last4 = Faucher | first4 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A Theoretical and Empirical Review of the Death Thought Accessibility Concept in Terror Management Research | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 5| pages = 699–739 | doi=10.1037/a0020524 | pmid=20804234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name = "Green 1994"/&gt; as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner's]] research on [[thought suppression]] (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a)&amp;nbsp;those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b)&amp;nbsp;those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trafimow|first=David|author2=Jamie S. Hughes |title=Testing the Death Thought Suppression and Rebound Hypothesis|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=5|pages=622–629|doi=10.1177/1948550611432938|url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/5/622.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these initial studies (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;Greenberg ''et al.'' (2004); Arndt ''et al.'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Solomon | first4 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli increases defense of the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 379–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00429.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;coff_&amp;nbsp;_ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;sk_&amp;nbsp;_l as skill, not skull).&lt;ref name="TMHM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Goldenberg | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Arndt | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Empowering the self: Using the terror management health model to promote breast self-examination | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 315–325 | doi = 10.1080/15298868.2010.52749 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death.

===Importance of the DTA hypothesis===

The introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 835–845 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., [[nationalism]], increased prejudice, [[Safe sex|risky sexual behavior]], etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death-related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats, (i.e., Heine ''et al.'', 2006&lt;ref name = "Heine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Proulx | first2 = T. | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K. D. | year = 2006 | title = The meaning maintenance model: On the coherence of human motivations | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 88–110 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1002_1| pmid = 16768649 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.434.4237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and that is death itself, and not uncertainty and lack of control associated with death; Fritsche ''et al.'' (2008) explore this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritsche | first1 = I. | last2 = Jonas | first2 = E. | last3 = Fankhänel | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = The role of control motivation in mortality salience effects on ingroup support and defense | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 524–541 | doi=10.1037/a0012666 | pmid=18729692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies.&lt;ref name = "Hayes"/&gt;

===Death anxiety on health promotion===

How people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self-consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt; The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt;

Due to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being [[cancer]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case)&lt;ref name="death anxiety"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozo | first1 = Ö. | last2 = Tunca | first2 = A. | last3 = Şİmşek | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of death anxiety and age on health- promoting behaviors: A terror-management theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389 | pmid = 19606644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion.&lt;ref name="death anxiety"/&gt;

==Terror management health model==
The terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt;

According to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as [[Breast self-examination|breast self-exam]]s (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the [[birthday effect]], where mortality rates seem to spike around these days.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious.&lt;ref name="TMHM"/&gt; According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt; Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt;

Additionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors.

In terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on:
# The individuals' level of smoking-based self-esteem
# The warnings' actual degree of death information&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

== Emotion ==
People with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Routledge|first=C. |author2=Ostafin, B. |author3=Juhl, J. |author4=Sedikides, C. |author5=Cathey, C.  |author6=Liao, J.|title=The effects of self-esteem and mortality salience on well-being, growth motivation, and maladaptive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|pages=897–916|doi=10.1037/a0021431 |volume=99 |issue=6 |pmid=21114350|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.8476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
It has been suggested that culture provides  meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when [[George&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Bush]]'s [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] jumped almost 50&amp;nbsp;percent following the [[September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks]] in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.

Researchers Cohen ''et al.'' (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized [[compassion]], trust, and confidence in others), and [[charisma]]tic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the [[control group]] were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt ''et al.'' 2010). This has links to [[social role theory]].

==TMT and religion==
TMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heflick |first=Nathan |author2=Goldenberg, J. |title=No atheists in foxholes: Arguments for (but not against) afterlives buffer mortality salience effects for atheists |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |year=2012| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02058.x |pmid=21995319 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=385–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jong |first=Jonathan |author2=Halberstadt, Jamin |author3=Bluemke, Matthias |title=Foxhole atheism, revisited: The effects of mortality salience on explicit and implicit religious belief |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.005 |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=983–989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom and Nancy Dess]&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarreteNormativeBiasEP.pdf Normative Bias and Adaptive Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization.

===Prevalence of death in TMT===
Since findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in – for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Maxfield | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On the unique psychological import of the human awareness of mortality: Theme and variations | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 328–356 | doi=10.1080/10478400701369542}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

With regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to "linguistic or experiential connection with mortality" (p.&amp;nbsp;332)&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home – many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Meaning maintenance model===
The meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; In response, people concentrate on "meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity" and that such "meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; These meanings, among other things, should "provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt;

TMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, "different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions".&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, MMM&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

In sum, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; As an example, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Offensive defensiveness===
Some theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = I. | last2 = Zanna | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Spencer | first4 = S. J. | year = 2001 | title = Compensatory conviction in the face of personal uncertainty: Going to extremes and being oneself | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 472–488 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.3.472}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach.&lt;ref name ="uniqueness of death"/&gt;  Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="FOTU"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Fear of the unknown: One fear to rule them all?|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=June 2016|volume=41|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.03.011|pmid=27067453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, "'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'....Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty.&lt;ref name = "FOTU" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Into the unknown: A review and synthesis of contemporary models involving uncertainty|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=April 2016|volume=39|pages=30–43|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.02.007|pmid=26945765}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant.  Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film "[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]" (which contains a severed head).

Though TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under&amp;nbsp;mortality salience.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Evolutionary psychology, coalitional psychology, and TMT===
Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals' that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations.&lt;ref name = "Landau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = S. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Greenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On the compatibility of terror management theory and perspectives on human evolution | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 476–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; In response, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the ''future''. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau ''et al.'', 2007.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,&lt;ref name = "FOTU"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review" /&gt;).

Coalitional psychology&amp;nbsp;(CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats.&lt;ref name= "Nav"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.M.T. | year = 2005 | title = Normative bias and adaptive challenges: A relational approach to coalitional psychology and a critique of terror management theory | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 297–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group.&lt;ref name = "Nav"/&gt; TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP 1) cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; 2) it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; 3) it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and 4) the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, 5) it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ku.edu/~mjlandau/docs/Landau_tmt%20and%20evol%20psych_EP%202007.pdf On the Compatibility of Terror Management Theory and Perspectives on Human Evolution&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18001">'''Voodoo death''', a term coined by [[Walter Cannon]] in 1942 also known as '''psychogenic death''' or '''psychosomatic death''', is the phenomenon of sudden [[death]] as brought about by a strong emotional shock, such as fear. The anomaly is recognized as "psychosomatic" in that death is caused by an emotional response—often fear—to some suggested outside force. Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and [[concentration camp|concentration]]- or [[prisoner of war camps]], but the condition is not specific to any particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStumpfe1979|Stumpfe, K.D. "The psychogenic death of Mr. J. A case report."]] pp. 263–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Cannon and his work==
In 1942, [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern [[physiological psychology]], published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;[[#Reference-idCannon1942|Cannon, Walter. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of [[supernatural]] consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives.

What Cannon describes has since been termed "bone-pointing syndrome," wherein an individual receives some sort of shock—often the breaking of some social/religious taboo—that he interprets as an ill omen for himself; his physical condition then deteriorates at a rapid rate, and he dies within a period as short as 24 hours after the initial shock.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon discusses the example of a [[Māori people|Maori]] woman who learned that the fruit she had eaten came from a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (tabooed) place; less than 24 hours later she was dead. Conversely, Cannon also shares the example of a young man who had fallen ill when the local witch doctor had pointed a bone at him, a societal taboo that meant a curse of death; however, when the perpetrator explained to the young man that the whole thing had been a mistake, and that no bone had been pointed at him at all, the young man's health returned instantly.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon notes the similarities in each case: the individuals were both members of a society where beliefs in the supernatural are fiercely upheld, and both had suffered what they both believed to be some form of a [[curse]] as dictated within their personal beliefs; also, the individuals shared similar physical symptoms. And yet, in the case of the young man, once the cause for the psychological distress was removed, his mysterious illness disappeared. Cannon attributes these rather drastic physical repercussions as the workings of the emotion fear upon the mind which then leads to destruction of the physical condition.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

==Causes==
===Cannon's explanation===
According to Cannon, the emotion of fear working on the mind, which he terms the "sympathetic" or "sympathico-adrenal" division of the nervous system, causes a fall in blood pressure as brought on by "a reduction of the volume of circulating blood".&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; Cannon explains the loss of blood volume by the constant injection of adrenaline into the small arterioles which constrict, preventing a proper flow of blood within the body and causing a drop in blood pressure. From there, the weak blood pressure prevents the sufficient circulation of the blood by damaging the heart and nerves responsible for the maintenance of the vessels which transport blood, thus making it harder for circulation to continue since the very organs necessary to maintain proper blood circulation are deteriorating. An accelerated heart rate then ensues, followed by rapid breathing. Added to these symptoms are the effects of no food or drink in the person experiencing psychological distress: Cannon suggests that true shock, in the medical sense, could be the cause of death as a result of little food or drink. States Cannon: "The combination of lack of food and water, anxiety, very rapid pulse and respiration, associated with a shocking experience having persistent effects, would fit well with fatal conditions reported from primitive tribes."&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

===Modern explanations===
Since 1942, scientists have discovered many more of the processes involved in the effect of stress upon the body, such as the region of the brain called the [[amygdala]]. The series of events by which a sensory stimulus is introduced to the mind, and the amygdala processes the emotion of fear which follows is called the "vision-to-fear pathway", or the "auditory-to-fear pathway", depending on the stimulus.

The generally recognized sequence of events, as enumerated by Esther M. Sternberg, MD, in 2002, stands as follows: various chemicals and electrical impulses are released that are transmitted by nerve fibers. Simultaneously, hormones are excreted from the brain, [[adrenal]] and [[pituitary glands]] in response to stress on the system. [[Cardiac arrhythmias]] are often the result of an overabundance of these hormones on the system.&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;[[#Reference-idSternberg2002|Sternberg, Esther. "Walter B. Cannon and 'Voodoo' Death: A Perspective From 60 Years On."]] pp. 1564–1566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Wylie Vale]], PhD, discovered [[corticotrophin]], the brain's hypothalamic stress hormone, or CRH: this hormone secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] coordinates with "the brain stem adrenaline centers involved in initiation of the sympathetic response ... to cause a massive release of both adrenaline-like nerve chemicals and stress hormones. Together these might well cause illness, including loss of appetite, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even vascular collapse that could result in death."&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

Martin A. Samuels, MD, elaborates further on still another process of death, stating that with the release of adrenaline and an increased heart rate, sometimes [[catecholamines]], stress hormones, will build up, leading to calcium channels opening and remaining open, resulting in an overflow of calcium into the system, killing off cells.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;[[#Reference-idKirn2004|Kirn, Timothy. "Voodoo death is brain's lethal response to fear."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasympathetic over-activation==
Cannon believed that extreme emotional stress could be explained in terms of degree of sympathetic-adrenal excitation. However, an experiment performed by Curt Richter (1957) responded to Cannon's challenge with an animal model. Richter placed pre-stressed rats in a closed turbulent water. the latency to drowning was recorded. Most domestic lab rats lasted for hours while unexpectedly all of the wild rats died within 15 minutes. Richter monitored heart rate and determined whether the heart was in systole or diastole after death. He found out that heart rate slowed down prior to death and the heart was engaged with blood reflecting a state of diastole. This contradicted Cannons proposal that sympathetic adrenal over-activation is the result of death since a sympathetic over-arousal would increase both heart rate and blood pressure to severe degrees.
Richter interpreted this that the rats died as a result of over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, specifically the [[vagus nerve]] which regulates heartbeat. The lethal vagal effect was the psychological state of hopelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richter | first1 = C.P. | year = 1957 | title = On the phenomenon of sudden death in animals and man | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 191–8 | doi=10.1097/00006842-195705000-00004| pmid = 13432092 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.1405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden prolonged immobility or faked death is an adaptive response exhibited by many mammalian species. Hofer(1970) demonstrated that several rodent species when threatened exhibited an immobility that was accompanied by a very low heart rate. For some of the rodents that heart rate reached below 50% of the baseline. Hofer distinguished between prolonged immobility and faked death phenomenon. Unlike the behavior of "hopelessness" described by Richter, the death-faking occurred with a sudden motor collapse during active struggling. Hofer interpreted the fear-inducing slowing of heart rate as a vagal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofer | first1 = M.A. | year = 1970 | title = Cardiac respiratory function during sudden prolonged immobility in wild rodents | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 633–47 | doi=10.1097/00006842-197011000-00008| pmid = 5530023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These data suggest that vagus contributes to severe emotional states and may be related to emotional states of immobilization, such as extreme terror. Unfortunately, this immobilization technique is potentially life-threatening for mammals (but not for reptiles). Mammals would undergo states of [[bradycardia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as an over-activation of parasympathetic vagus system. The organs of the oxygen-hungry mammal are deprived of oxygen due to lack of blood flow, and the animal dies.

==Critical evaluation==
Despite Cannon's general ignorance on the particulars of physiological breakdown, scientists in the intervening years since the publication of Cannon's work, have generally agreed with his fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death. Criticisms that generally come against Cannon's work are directed at the hearsay nature of Cannon's case studies, but recent studies have discovered numerous examples of voodoo death in various societies.&lt;ref name="Lester"&gt;[[#Reference-idLester2009|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; To those who allege difficulty in the experimental process of validating Cannon's theory, Barbara W. Lex, in her 1974 article titled, "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation", states that "Voodoo death" can easily be observed without complicated experiments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pupillary constriction, easily observable and indicative of parasympathetic activation ... the amount of saliva, of perspiration, degree of muscle tonicity and skin pallor in an individual are also discernible without complicated instruments."&lt;ref name="Lex"&gt;[[#Reference-idLex2009|Lex, Barbara. "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation."]] pp. 818–823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are those who contest the theories involving psychologically-induced body failure. David Lester, PhD, in 1972, contends that Cannon's evidence, particularly the evidence concerning animals, is anecdotal and irrelevant, and instead sets forth the concept of "death by suggestion", and supports "giving up-given up" complex set forth by George L. Engel, thus attributing the cause of death entirely to the psychological state of the individual in question rather than a psychological–physiological connection adduced by Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLester1972|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death: Some New Thoughts on an Old Phenomenon."]] pp. 386–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Going even further, Harry D. Eastwell, MD in his 1982 article, "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia", rejects entirely the concept of "Voodoo death", stating that the deaths in cases reported by Cannon et al. were more likely due to dehydration rather than to any psychological response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEastwell1982|Eastwell, Harry D. "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia."]] pp. 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of this theory on modern science==
===Fight or flight===
Deeply related to these cases of sudden death is what Cannon termed the "[[fight-or-flight response]]", what has been classified as a "neurophysiological-behavioral" response pattern. "Fight or flight" is a phrase used to describe the instinctual and physiological responses to strong emotion within animals as well as humans. Cannon associates the two emotions of rage and fear because of the similar effects the emotions will have upon the mind and body—rage will encourage the response to "fight", while fear will encourage "flight". The mind, when faced with one or both of these emotions in response to a perceived threat, will emit adrenaline, and heart rate will increase; however, sometimes the system is overwhelmed by the responses, and collapse ensues as brought about by the workings of stress hormones.&lt;ref name= "Samuels"/&gt;

In the case of voodoo death, the "flight" response overpowers the system, but there is little to no possibility for action in the mind of the individual suffering from the perceived threat—considering the state of aboriginal tribes, the victims believe themselves to be suffering from a curse in which they are condemned to die, and so they believe themselves to be unable to act to save themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGomez1982|Gomez, E.A. "Voodoo and sudden death: the effects of expectations on health."]] pp. 75–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New fields===
Cannon's theory concerning voodoo death opened research into various fields of psychological studies; since the publication of Cannon's work, scientists have discovered many disorders and the like related to psychosomatic responses to situations. Because of Cannon's postulation that the mind could bring about death, scientists have become open to the idea of the mind working on the body in a greater number of ways, leading to the development of [[psychosomatic medicine]].&lt;ref name="names"&gt;[[#Reference-idLane2009|Lane, R.D., Waldstein, S.R., Chesney, M.A, et al. "The Rebirth of Neuroscience in Psychosomatic Medicine, Part I: Historical Context, Methods, and Relevant Basic Science."]] pp. 117–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of theories concerning voodoo death within the scientific field has also led to the development of a branch of psychology termed [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="names"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
Though cases within aboriginal societies are the most commonly cited when researchers such as Cannon set forth examples, similar cases of psychosomatic death have also been reported in other cultures.

In his 1964 article, James L. Mathis, MD, describes a case of a previously healthy man who died from asthmatic attacks when his mother "cursed" him for going against her wishes. Mathis proposes that "fatal psychosomatic conditions" were the cause of this man's death, and thus a form of voodoo death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMathis1964|Mathis, James L. "Sophisticated Version of Voodoo Death."]] pp. 104–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist—Clifton K. Meador, MD—in 1992 discussed the case of a man diagnosed with cancer who, along with his physicians and family, believed he was dying of cancer. In the autopsy after his death, however, the doctors discovered that his cancer was not at all the cause of his death. Meador deduces that the man's belief in his imminent death was the cause of his death itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1546347 | volume=85 | issue=3 | title=Hex death: voodoo magic or persuasion? | journal=South Med J | pages=244–7 | last1 = Meador | first1 = CK | doi=10.1097/00007611-199203000-00004| year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xenotransplantation''' (''xenos-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "foreign" or strange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dooldeniya |first1=M D , |last2=Warrens |first2=AN |title=Xenotransplantation: where are we today? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539416/ |website=NCBI |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=C Ben |title=Xenotransplanation and Transgenics: The Need to Discuss Limits |url=https://cbhd.org/content/xenotransplanation-and-transgenics-need-discuss-limits |website=Cbhd |publisher=Cbhd |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''heterologous transplant''' is the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s from one [[species]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/transplantation/xeno/en/ Xenotransplantation]. Definition by the World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt; Such cells, tissues or organs are called '''xenografts''' or '''xenotransplants'''. It is contrasted with [[allotransplantation]] (from other individual of same species), [[Syngenic|syngeneic]] transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and [[autotransplantation]] (from one part of the body to another in the same person).

Xenotransplantation of human [[tumor]] cells into [[immunocompromised]] mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical [[oncology]] research.

Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage [[organ failure]], a significant health problem in parts of the [[industrialized world]].  It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kress | first1 = J. M. | title = Xenotransplantation: Ethics and economics | journal = Food and drug law journal | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–384 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10346691}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission ([[xenozoonosis]]) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to [[animal testing]], animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/organfarm/interviews/lyons.html |title=Interviews - Dan Lyons |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html  |title=Organ Transplants from Animals: Examining the Possibilities |publisher=Internet Archive |work=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210031618/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html |archivedate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the [[scientific literature]]) to maintain the more precise distinction in [[usage]].

==History==

The first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with [[renal insufficiency]].&lt;ref name=History1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reemtsma|first1=K|title=Xenotransplantation: A Historical Perspective.|journal=ILAR journal|date=1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=9–12|pmid=11528018|url=https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/37/1/9/760596/Xenotransplantation-A-Historical-Perspective|doi=10.1093/ilar.37.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

Scientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the [[immunological]] basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.  Even more studies followed Dr. [[Joseph Murray]]'s first successful [[kidney transplantation|renal transplantation]] in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

In 1963, doctors at [[Tulane University]] attempted [[chimpanzee]]-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

An American infant girl known as "[[Baby Fae]]" with [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a [[baboon]] heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by [[Leonard L. Bailey]] at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Fae died 21 days later due to a [[Humoral immunity|humoral-based]] [[graft rejection]] thought to be caused mainly by an ABO [[blood type]] mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable [[allograft]] replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360230053022 | last1 = Bailey | first1 = L.

Human organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying [[human biology]] without harming human patients.

If [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.

Xenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from [[Transplant rejection|rejecting]] allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Platt JL, Cascalho M |title= New and old technologies for organ replacement|journal= Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 179–85|pmid=23449347|year= 2013|doi= 10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f0887|pmc=4911019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3501885 |pmid= 23172951|year= 2012|author1= Van Der Windt|first1= D.

== Potential animal organ donors ==

Since they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for [[xenotransfusion]]s. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.&lt;ref name=michler1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Michler | first1 = R. | title = Xenotransplantation: Risks, Clinical Potential, and Future Prospects | doi = 10.3201/eid0201.960111 | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–70 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8903201 | pmc =2639801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic pig|Pig]]s (''Sus scrofa domesticus'') are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M.

In the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the ''in vivo'' generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Matsunari Hitomi |author2=Nagashima Hiroshi |author3=Watanabe Masahito | year = | title = and Hiromitsu Nakauchi (2013).

==Barriers and issues==

=== Immunologic barriers ===

To date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]. "Xenozoonoses" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boneva |first1=RS |last2=Folks |first2=TM |last3=Chapman |first3=LE |title=Infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation. |journal=Clinical microbiology reviews |date=January 2001 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1-14 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.1-14.2001 |pmid=11148000}}&lt;/ref&gt;This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: 
* Hyperacute rejection
* Acute vascular rejection
* Cellular rejection
* Chronic rejection

A rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of [[antibodies]] present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;

==== Hyperacute rejection ====

This rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human [[complement system]], which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the [[IgM]] class, but also include [[IgG]], and [[IgA]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase.&lt;ref name=candinas2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Candinas | first1 = D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = D. H. | title = Xenotransplantation: Postponed by a millennium? | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/93.2.63 | journal = QJM | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–66 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10700475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign [[antigen]] by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the [[classical complement pathway]]. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis]] of the xenograft.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

===== Overcoming hyperacute rejection =====

Since hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:

''Interruption of the complement cascade'' 
*The recipient's complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-C5 antibodies, or C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

''Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)'' 
*1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts – These pigs don’t contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-α-1,3Gal moiety (the α-Gal epitope).&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

*Increased expression of H-transferase (α 1,2 fucosyltransferase), an enzyme that competes with galactosyl transferase. Experiments have shown this reduces α-Gal expression by 70%.&lt;ref name=sharma&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.14.7190 | last1 = Sharma | first1 = A. | last2 = Okabe | first2 = J. | last3 = Birch | first3 = P. | last4 = McClellan | first4 = S.

*Expression of human complement regulators ([[CD55]], [[CD46]], and [[CD59]]) to inhibit the complement cascade.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb00521.x | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. | last2 = Gou | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhen | first3 = C. | last4 = Jiang | first4 = D. | last5 = Mao | first5 = X. | last6 = Li | first6 = W. | last7 = Chen | first7 = S. | last8 = Cai | first8 = C. | title = Protection of xenogeneic cells from human complement-mediated lysis by the expression of human DAF, CD59 and MCP | journal = FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–209 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11720816}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plasmaphoresis, on humans to remove 1,3 galactosyltransferase, reduces the risk of activation of effector cells such as CTL (CD8 T cells), complement pathway activation and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

====Acute vascular rejection====

Also known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly [[macrophages]] and [[natural killer cells]] (with small numbers of [[T cells]]), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

Binding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]], as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as [[E-selectin]], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([[ICAM-1]]), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([[VCAM-1]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

This response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

===== Overcoming acute vascular rejection =====
Due to its complexity,  the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: 
*Administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis
*Depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation
*Inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

==== Accommodation ====

If hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection&lt;ref name=takahashi&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = T. | last2 = Saadi | first2 = S. | last3 = Platt | first3 = J. L. | doi = 10.1007/BF02786395 | title = Recent advances in the immunology of xenotransplantation | journal = Immunologic Research | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–297 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9379077 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as [[heme oxygenase-1]] (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

==== Cellular rejection ====
Rejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the [[humoral immune system]], since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on [[cellular immunity]], and is mediated by: 
*Natural killer cells, which accumulate in and damage the xenograft; and
*T-lymphocytes – which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.

In direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=abbas2005&gt;Abbas, A., Lichtman, A. (2005) ''Cellular and Molecular Immunology'', 5th ed., pp. 81, 330–333, 381, 386. Elsevier Saunders, Pennsylvania,{{ISBN|0-7216-0008-5}}, {{DOI|10.1002/bmb.2004.494032019997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===== Overcoming cellular rejection =====

A proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of [[hematopoiesis]]. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

==== Chronic rejection ====

Chronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt; [[Fibrosis]] in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is [[arteriosclerosis]]. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years.&lt;ref name="abbas2005"/&gt; It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.&lt;ref name=vanderpool&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanderpool | first1 = H. Y. | title = Xenotransplantation: Progress and promise | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7220.1311 | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7220 | page = 1311 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559062| pmc =1129087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dysregulated coagulation ====

Successful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as [[coagulopathy]].&lt;ref name="cowan2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cowan PJ |author2=Robson SC |author3=d’Apice AJF |title=Controlling coagulation dysregulation in xenotransplantation|journal=Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=214–21|pmid=21415824|pmc=3094512|year=2011|doi=10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283446c65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of [[coagulopathy]], or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe [[thrombocytopenia]], causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding.&lt;ref name="cowan2011" /&gt; An alternate clotting disorder, [[thrombosis]], may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting.&lt;ref name="ekser2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ekser B, Cooper DK|title=Overcoming the barriers to xenotransplantation: prospects for the future|journal=Expert review of clinical immunology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=219–30|pmid=20402385|pmc=2857338|year=2010|doi=10.1586/eci.09.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

Just as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

=== Physiology ===
Extensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:

*Size – Differences in organ size limit the range of potential recipients of xenotransplants.
*Longevity – The lifespan of most pigs is roughly 15 years, currently it is unknown whether or not a xenograft may be able to last longer than that. 
*Hormone and protein differences – Some proteins will be molecularly incompatible, which could cause malfunction of important regulatory processes. These differences also make the prospect of hepatic xenotransplantation less promising, since the liver plays an important role in the production of so many proteins.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;
*Environment – For example, pig hearts work in a different anatomical site and under different hydrostatic pressure than in humans.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;
*Temperature – The body temperature of pigs is 39&amp;nbsp;°C (2&amp;nbsp;°C above the average human body temperature). Implications of this difference, if any, on the activity of important enzymes are currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===Xenozoonosis===
Xenozoonosis,  also known as [[zoonosis]] or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the [[avian influenza]], when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans.&lt;ref name=who2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beigel | first1 = J. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | last3 = Han | first3 = A. | last4 = Hayden | first4 = F. | last5 = Hyer | first5 = R. | last6 = De Jong | first6 = M. | last7 = Lochindarat | first7 = S. | last8 = Nguyen | first8 = T. | last9 = Nguyen | first9 = T. | last10 = Tran | first10 = T.

*Implantation breaches the physical barrier that normally helps to prevent disease transmission,	
*The recipient of the transplant will be severely immunosuppressed; and
*Human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, and CD59) expressed in transgenic pigs have been shown to serve as virus receptors, and may also help to protect viruses from attack by the complement system.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00128-X | last1 = Takeuchi | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = R.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000 /&gt; Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA. (2006) [http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm Xenotransplantation Action Plan: FDA Approach to the Regulation of Xenotransplantation]. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA ([[histocompatibility]]).

In 2005, the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |title=The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's 2005 statement on xenotransplantation |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |archivedate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated "... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim (10 December 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005407/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia Xenotransplantation ban lifted in Australia]. lifescientist.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====
[[Endogenous retroviruses]] are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance.&lt;ref name="vanderpool"/&gt; Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt; PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells.&lt;ref name=armstrong1971&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-10-2-195 | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = J.

In addition, through complementation and genetic recombination, two defective PERV genomes could give rise to an infectious virus.&lt;ref name=Rogel-Gaillard1999&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000015294 | last1 = Rogel-Gaillard | first1 = C. | last2 = Bourgeaux | first2 = N. | last3 = Billault | first3 = A. | last4 = Vaiman | first4 = M. | last5 = Chardon | first5 = P. | title = Construction of a swine BAC library: Application to the characterization and mapping of porcine type C endoviral elements | journal = Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics | volume = 85 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 205–211 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10449899}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three subgroups of infectious PERVs (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C).

===Ethics===
Xenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 PETA Media Center: Factsheet: Xenotransplantation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626072643/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 |date=June 26, 2010 }}. Peta.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the major religions object to the use of genetically modified pig organs for life-saving transplantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothblatt |first=Martine |date=2004 |title=Your Life or Mine |location=Burlington, VT |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company |pages=109–110 |isbn=978-0754623915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the use of pig and cow tissue in humans has been met with little resistance, save some religious beliefs and a few philosophical objections. Experimentation without consent doctrines are now followed, which was not the case in the past, which may lead to new religious guidelines to further medical research on pronounced ecumenical guidelines.

==== Informed consent of patient ====
[[Autonomy]] and [[informed consent]] are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison T. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethics and regulation|journal=Xenotransplantation|volume=13|issue=6|pages=505–9|pmid=17059575|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2006.00352_3.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that [[xenozoonosis]] is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the [[confidentiality|principles of confidentiality]] broken?

The safety of public health is a factor to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaiser M. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethical considerations based on human and societal perspectives|journal=Acta veterinaria Scandinavica. Supplementum|volume=99|pages=65–73|pmid=15347151|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any risk to the public at all for an [[outbreak]] from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.

The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sykes M |author2=D’Apice A |author3=Sandrin M |year= 2003|title= Position Paper of the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association|journal= Xenotransplantation|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= 194–203|pmid=12694539|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00067.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and the [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]].
In 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. 

==== Xenotransplantion guidelines in the United States ====

The Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;United States Food and Drug Administration.
