      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7939">'''''A Nervous Smile''''' is a play written by [[John Belluso]] that was originally commissioned by the [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]. It opened March 4, 2005 for the 29th annual [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belluso|first1=John|title=A Nervous Smile|date=2006|publisher=Dramatists Play Services Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8222-2095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/|title=Humana Festival of New American Plays - Actors Theatre of Louisville|website=Actors Theatre of Louisville|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was originally directed by [[David Esbjornson]] and starred Sean Haberle as Brian, Maureen Mueller as Eileen, Mhari Sandoval as Nic, and [[Dale Soules]] as Blanka. Unseen characters include heavy reference to Brian and Eileen's child Emily and Nic's son Dominic, both of whom have severe [[cerebral palsy]] as well as to Nic's ex-husband and Blanka's adult daughter. The story is set in a present-day Manhattan apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anervoussmile.wordpress.com/the-play/|title=The Play|website=A Nervous Smile|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==

'''Brian:''' Husband to Eileen in his late 30s, a college professor and failed novelist. Throughout the play he struggles to understand his place as father to a child with cerebral palsy and also grapples with his relationship to his wife and to the woman he is having an affair with.

'''Eileen:''' Wife to Brian in her early 40s. A multi-millionaire from investing in her father's company, she is snobbish, alcoholic, and regularly pops pills ([[Vicodine]] and [[Oxycontin]] being the two primarily mentioned and utilized drugs). She doesn't have any desire to be raising a child with cerebral palsy but also feels a motherly instinct to remain with Emily that Brian doesn't appear to feel.

'''Nic:''' A single mom who was once good friends with Eileen. She is now having an affair with Brian. She works as a lawyer who can hardly support her son Dominic, who has severe cerebral palsy. She initially agrees to run away with Brian but freezes up at the last moment and decides she must stay with her son.

'''Blanka:''' Brian and Eileen's maid in her late 50s. She is originally from Russia and is the one who actually cares for Emily. Blanka knows Emily's secrets and is the only character in this play to acknowledge Emily as a real person.

== Plot ==

=== Act I ===
The play begins with Brian, Eileen, and Nic returning to Brian and Eileen's apartment in Manhattan. They've just come from the funeral of a child from the Cerebral Palsy Support Group that the three attend. They stopped at a bar on their way home and seem to show an overall lack of empathy for the family of the child that passed. There are clear tensions among the three and while Eileen is out of the room it is revealed that Brian is having an affair with Nic. You then find out that offstage Emily is having a seizure and Eileen once again exits to calm her daughter. While she is away Brian admits his and Eileen's plan. He tells Nic of his dreams to live with her in Buenos Aires and this can happen because Eileen is going to grant him a divorce as well as half of his money ($10 million) and a promise that they will never see one another again. The couple have planned to abandon Emily at the emergency room in the middle of the night. Brian wants Nic to come with him and insists that she call Dominic's father to have him pick up their son so Nic can run away with Brian. The act ends with Eileen returning to the living room and encouraging Nic to go with the plan and to love Brian. Just before the blackout, Nic agrees to go.

=== Act II ===
This act opens during the middle of the next night, the night in which they plan on abandoning their children and running away. Nic arrives at the apartment early feeling overwhelmed and needing to begin the plan immediately. Brian agrees and goes to wake Eileen and gather her things. While he does so, Nic is left alone. Suddenly, Blanka wakes from where she is sleeping under a blanket on the living room couch. She speaks with Nic and tries to understand why Nic feels the need to abandon her child and Blanka works desperately to convince Nic to stay. Nic, in response, tells her of one of the 'bad days' Dominic had recently and how overwhelmed she has become caring for him, reasoning that because of this her only option is to leave. The scene ends with Brian carrying a sleeping Emily out the door with Nic and Eileen close on his heels.

=== Act III ===
This act begins once more in the Manhattan apartment. Nic and Eileen sit in the living room. The audience learns that Brian left Nic at the airport security check when she began to have second thoughts about running away with him and abandoning her son. It is also revealed that Eileen had fallen into a drug-induced sleep at her own gate and missed her flight to London. Police found them both and they were quickly arrested for child abandonment. Nic has luckily been granted shared custody of her son. However, Eileen is likely to lose Emily and is having to pack up her things which will be picked up by social workers as Emily is going into foster care. As the two women reflect on their shared experiences the image of Brian (wherever he is in the world) appears and he expresses his true hatred for Emily and everything she represents to him. Blanka then returns, having spent all of the money that Brian originally paid her to not go to the police. In an emotional outburst, she convinces Eileen to listen to some of Emily's poems which is the last thing the audience hears as the lights go out. They hear a robotic communication board voice slowly becoming the voice of a little girl.

== Augmented communication ==
In some cases of cerebral palsy, the damage is so severe that is affects the person's speech and language abilities. While they may be able to have complex thoughts and ideas, their muscles and vocal chords are unable to form the words that they are trying to express. Augmented forms of communication can vary greatly and include non-technology picture boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amyspeechlanguagetherapy.com/communication-boards.html|title=Communication Boards|website=Amy Speech &amp; Language Therapy, Inc.|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; text boards and digitized speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioddev.org/inventory_detail.php?equip_id=2657|title=Institute on Disabilities {{!}} Programs {{!}} Assistive Technology {{!}} PATLL {{!}}ECO2 Communication Device|website=www.ioddev.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Nervous Smile,'' we see the two different ends of the augmented communication spectrum, with Dominic possessing a basic communication board and Emily having both an advanced wheelchair and advanced augmented communication that can provide a voice, save things she's said, and predict what she will say.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1300">In [[painting]], a '''retarder''' is a substance, usually added to [[water]], used to slow the drying time of [[acrylic paints]], giving more time for [[Mixing (process engineering)|blending]] or [[layering]] [[Specular highlight|highlights]].

==Use in fine art==
Retarders are used to counter the fast drying properties of acrylic paints making possible the usage of wet on wet or other techniques which would otherwise require oil paints. Even if they will never give acrylic the working time oil paints permits, depending how much it is adding to paint, they can give anywhere from half an hour to a full day's working time.

==Content==
They generally contain glycol (such as [[propylene glycol]]) or glycerin-based additives.

== Home-Made ==
For home-made acrylic retarder, water [[glycerol]] down about 5:1 (water: glycerol) and apply to paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |title=Home Made Acrylic Retarders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515215304/http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-toxic car anti-freeze, which contains propylene glycol can also be used.

It is essentially the graffiti of artwork. Added Art is a merging of high and low art, using the concepts of graffiti, in a high art environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16410">'''Aesthetic judgement''', often also referred to as ‘taste’, is a concept in [[aesthetics]] which attempts to explain the nature of judgements of [[beauty]] and whether or not these judgements are legitimate.

The key idea for most traditional theories of taste was that objects possessed concrete properties that the perceiver ought to judge as beautiful or not. Failure to make the correct judgement was considered as something deficient within the beholder, whether that be a flaw within the person’s virtue or connected to a lack of knowledge that hinders their ability to perceive the beauty of the object. 

Aesthetic judgement as a concept rose to prominence in the eighteenth century, however its roots can be traced back many years to ancient Greek and medieval philosophers.

== Ancient conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right). Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his theory of forms, whilst Aristotle disagrees and points down towards reality, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] did not possess an explicit concept of aesthetic judgement, however their ideas regarding aesthetics inspired later developments.  

=== Plato ===
[[Plato|Plato’s]] [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory held that there is an incorporeal realm in which the perfect [[Theory of forms|Forms]] of reality exist. This includes the perfect Form of Beauty, which one can rise up to through a [[Dialectic|dialectical]] method. Thus, in Plato’s terms, knowledge is critical to developing a better understanding of beauty and thus, a better capacity for aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/a-taste/|title=Aesthetic Taste|last=Spicher|first=Michael|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] purported a more [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]] approach to aesthetic judgement, in that beauty was a property of objects being related to their size and proportion. To develop a capacity for aesthetic judgement, one has to observe enough objects of the same kind to uncover the correct form of those things. Both Aristotle and Plato perceived beauty as a property existing outside of human experience, with aesthetic judgement being the capacity to recognise that beauty, developed by the search for beauty in things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Medieval conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
Although Medieval philosophers did not possess a particular notion of individual preference or taste, they were particularly preoccupied with a [[Cosmology|cosmological]] interpretation of beauty, with relation to specific [[Ontology|ontological]] properties. This is attributed to the fact that philosophers of the medieval age had an object notion of beauty, and also because it was a common belief that morality was linked with beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marinescu|first=Axia|date=2014-01-01|title=Beauty and Judgement in German Aesthetics|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/hssr/3/1/article-p124.xml|journal=Human &amp; Social Studies. Research and Practice|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2478/hssr-2013-0024|issn=2285-5920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
Expanding upon Plato’s Theory of the Forms, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] believed that perfect beauty existed within God. Augustine proposed equality and unity as the two properties that made physical objects beautiful. Aesthetic judgement is thus the ability of an individual to recognise the unity and equality of an object, thus involving an exercise of reason and knowledge, similar to the theories of previous thinkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the ultimate state of beauty exists in God’s mind, an observer can only recognise this through [[divine illumination]]. Thus, one’s capacity for aesthetic judgement is improved the closer one is to God.

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also presented properties that make an object beautiful: proportion, wholeness and radiance. Thus, similar to his philosophical predecessors, he constituted the judgement of beauty to be dependent on knowledge and occurring through the function of cognition. Possessing a capacity for aesthetic judgement is therefore determined by one’s ability to recognise these properties in observed objects. Aquinas does however diverge from previous philosophers on certain notions. His definition of that beauty as "that which, when seen, pleases" can be interpreted as an implication of the subjectivity of beauty and thus judgements about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert E.|date=2015-06-23|title=Review of Aquinas on Beauty|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/aquinas-on-beauty/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he rejects Plato’s Theory of Forms, stating that beauty is a real quality present within objects. Ultimately however he converges upon Augustine’s view that God is the source of all beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== 18th century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Explicit theories of aesthetic judgement emerged and predominated in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, being referred to as “the century of taste”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435824318|title=The century of taste : the philosophical odyssey of taste in the eighteenth century|last=1926-|first=Dickie, George,|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195357134|location=New York|oclc=435824318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophers developed a more introspective stance to attempt to understand their personal dispositions to beauty.

=== Anthony Cooper, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury ===
[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Cooper]] (1671-1713), the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, purported his philosophical ideas through his [[Socratic dialogue]] “The Moralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody”, which stands in almost direct contrast to the theories and assumptions posited by Addison.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shelley|first=James|title=18th Century British Aesthetics|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/aesthetics-18th-british/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury claimed that taste was a quality innate within human beings. One’s capacity to observe and make correct judgements of beauty was dependent on one’s moral righteousness. The key property Shaftesbury ascribed to beautiful objects is harmony, the prime source of which is nature, which in turn is formed by God who is constituted as the ultimate source of beauty.

=== Joseph Addison ===
[[Joseph Addison]] (1672-1719) posited theories that were in almost direct contrast to those of Shaftesbury. Central to Addison’s theory of aesthetic judgement is the concept that pleasures of taste are essentially “pleasures of the imagination”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Addison’s fundamental divergence from Shaftesbury is that he views taste to be a judgement of visual representation as exercised by the imagination, rather than as an exercise of the intellect and of moral righteousness. Addison constituted two types of pleasures of the imagination: primary pleasures, as in those derived from visual images directly observed by an individual of an object in front of them and secondary pleasures, which arise from images of objects that are absent from sight and therefore exist only in the mind. Addison’s materialist basis predisposes his theory to subjectivism and relativism, leading Addison to declare that there “is not perhaps any real beauty”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Alexander Gerard ===
[[Alexander Gerard]] (1728-1795) considered taste in a similar fashion to the six external [[Sense|senses]], in that experiences of aesthetic judgement are also simple and instantaneous. He also developed his views from the philosophical framework of [[associationism]]. Aesthetic judgements are exercises of the faculty of imagination, in which a newly observed object is associated to previous ideas in the mind of the observer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gerard determines that taste is improved when a person exercises their capacities for judgment and taste to recognise the four core elements of sensibility, refinement, correctness and proportion within objects.

== David Hume's theory of taste ==
David Hume’s theories on aesthetic judgement were purported in his 1757 essay ''[[Four Dissertations|Of the Standard of Taste]]''. Hume ascribed some normative quality to aesthetic judgements whilst providing critiques of the more relativist positions on the matter. Whilst acknowledging that judgements cannot reasonably be determined to be objectively true or false, he championed the notion of “common sense”, which held that some evaluations are better than others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/hume_and_kant.htm|title=Aesthetic theories of David Hume and Immanuel Kant|website=web.mnstate.edu|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also reinforced the conception of aesthetic judgements as an exercise of the faculty of the imagination, determining beauty to not be a property of objects but existing only in the mind, and the ones that are deemed more beautiful are the ones that affect the higher sentiments, or high cognitive or intellectual capacities of the observer. Hume also sought to establish a universal standard of aesthetic judgement, seeking a basis upon which we can “confirm” one sentiment and “condemn” another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In doing this he refers to [[Classic book|classic texts]] which seemingly have received universal acclaim beyond through different times and cultures. Hume asserts that such universal acclamation identifies a work of real genius, and such works should be examined to provide us with guidelines for the composition of good art. Hume provides characteristics of what he refers to as a true judge in matters of aesthetics:
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of David Hume'' ''(1711-1776)'']]
{{Quote|text="Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice”|sign=David Hume|source="Four Dissertations", Of the Standard of Taste}}The consensus of these critics constitutes what Hume called a “joint verdict”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/aesthetic-judgment|title=Aesthetic Judgment {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which composes the "true standard"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for aesthetic judgements. This standard is constituted as universally correct, and failure to recognise pleasure in the object is considered a defect within the observer.

Hume does concede however that certain subjectivities affecting aesthetic judgements cannot be eliminated. He indicates two circumstances that will create irrevocable prejudices. First he refers to natural, generational and cultural dispositions which are fundamental and relative to individuals. The second is determined by the critics’ degree of moral righteousness. Ascribing a normative characteristic to morality, Hume declares that aesthetic merit is influenced by “the natural boundaries of vice and virtue”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and if the artist does not conform to these moral regulations then they and their art will inevitably divert from Hume’s true standard.

== Immanuel Kant's "judgement of taste" ==
Central to the concept of aesthetic judgement is Kant’s notion of the “judgement of taste”, introduced in his seminal 1790 book the ''[[Critique of Judgment|Critique of Judgement]].'' In the text, Kant determined two essential conditions for a judgement to be classified as a judgement of taste – subjectivity and universality. 

Subjectivity refers to the fact that a judgement of taste is based on a feeling of pleasure or displeasure. The second necessary condition of a judgement of taste is that it claims “universal validity”, which Kant describes as follows:

{{Quote|text=“… when [a man] puts a thing on a pedestal and calls it beautiful, he demands the same delight from others. He judges not merely from himself, but for all men, and then speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things”|sign=Immanuel Kant|source=Critique of Judgement}}
Kant emphasises the fact that requiring the agreement of others is an inextricable characteristic of aesthetic judgements. We think that others “ought” to share our judgement, and we blame them if they don’t, as if there was a deficiency within them to recognise beauty and make judgements upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zangwill|first=Nick|title=Aesthetic Judgment|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic judgements, unique from other types of judgements that Kant lists, therefore make a claim to universal validity. Kant also states that pleasure in beauty is disinterested in that it is desire-free. Whilst agreeing that pleasure in beauty can generate desire, he states that it is an essential characteristic of aesthetic judgements that they are found to be pleasurable because they are judged to be beautiful, rather than being judged as beautiful because they are found to be pleasurable.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/#SH2a|title=Immanuel Kant: Aesthetics|last=Burnham|first=Douglas|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant provides a “deep” account of the nature of pleasure in beauty, which states that it accomplished through the simultaneous exercise of the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the premise upon which Kant asserts his normative claim on aesthetic judgements. Because these judgements are a function of cognitive faculties, which Kant assumed can be shared by humans, it must be possible for them to be shared.
Kant also purported that pleasure in beauty can be attributed to our recognition that the qualities of an object conform to basic functions of human cognition. We maintain a presupposition that all objects seemed to be formed in a way that enables them to be analysed by human observers. Beauty is the quality of an object assuming a “form of purposiveness”, despite the absence of an identification of a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When we respond to an object’s appearance without any comprehension of utility, we respond in an aesthetic manner. The feeling of pleasure is a signal that the object is able to be comprehended through exercising the human faculty of understanding. An aesthetic judgement is therefore a judgement about human cognition rather than a material object.

== Nineteenth and twentieth century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Philosophical concerns with aesthetic judgement declined rapidly after the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, with the majority of discourse shifting to the concept of an aesthetic attitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, there have been philosophers who have persisted with the concept of aesthetic taste, which has resulted in some notable contributions in contemporary times. 

=== Frank Sibley ===
[[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] (1929-1996) defined aesthetic judgements to be evaluations that apply aesthetic concepts to objects through aesthetic terminology. Taste is thus an individual’s capacity to recognise these properties and employ aesthetic concepts and terms appropriately to describe them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sibley also asserts that aesthetic judgements are objective and that beauty is an objective property present within objects, departing from the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century philosophical norm of subjectivist interpretation.

'''Africa Beyond''' is a project celebrating African arts and culture in the UK, supported by [[Arts Council England]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Southbank Centre]], iniva (Institute for International Visual Arts) and other partners.

Africa Beyond was founded in March 2006, based in [[London]]. It was created as a legacy of Africa 05, a major celebration of African arts, held throughout 2005. It organises artist residencies linking Africa and the UK, runs public events such as the Word from Africa festival (first hosted at the British Museum in May 2007), and works with arts venues to improve their links with African audiences and artists.

The BBC hosted the Africa Beyond website, which features articles on African music, film, theatre, dance, literature and visual arts, with a special focus on artists and stories relevant to audiences in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/bbc-launches-africa-beyond/ "BBC launches Africa Beyond"], TheSouthAfrica.com, 27 march 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is no longer updated.

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of [[agitprop]], [[anti-art]] and [[Institutional Critique]], incorporating elements of [[détournement]], [[readymade]] or [[installation art|installation]]. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.&lt;ref name="The politics"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/13/1084289821310.html "The politics of art"] ''The Age,'' 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of [[free speech]], due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualarts.net.au/files/NQ%20Dec%2008_fin.pdf "25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia’s cultural policy agenda"] ''NAVA Quarterly''.

== Controversy ==

=== Victorian College of the Arts ===
In August 2003, McLennan hired a [[G4S|Group 4 Securicor]] guard to keep gallery punters out of an exhibition opening at the VCA. Group 4 run [[immigration detention]] centres in Australia, such as [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Baxter Detention Centre]] and the now closed [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Woomera Detention Centre]]. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the [[John Howard]] government's treatment of [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209182233/http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/09/03/1062548903857.html "VCA artwork raises ethics concerns"] ''The Age,'' 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24seven ===
In May 2004, McLennan produced ''Fifty-six,'' an exhibition designed to coincide with [[Nakba Day]], the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of [[Israel]]. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the [[City of Melbourne]] days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with "debatable" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro-Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of [[antisemitism]]. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier [[Steve Bracks]], Lord Mayor [[John So]] and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.discoverymedia.com.au/artzinePub/story.asp?id=375&amp;section=ExNews "Making Space – spanking the hand that feeds it"] ''Art Right Now,'' 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the [[Nazis]] had a similar position on what they termed [[degenerate art]]. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies.&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt;

=== Citylights ===
In August 2004, McLennan displayed ''State Sponsored'', a collection of portraits of [[Hamas]] militants, including [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdul Aziz Rantisi|Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi]] and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project – a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the [[Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]]. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of "state sponsored" referred to [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jewish-group-blasts-offensive-artwork/2004/12/10/1102625519852.html "Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork"] ''The Age,'' 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Artists Group ===
In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's ''Canberra's 18'' exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the [[Platform artists group]]'s [[Artist-run initiative]] (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor [[Gary Singer]] claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister [[Julian Burnside]] claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/war-on-terrorism-is-claiming-victims-on-the-walls-of-art-galleries/2005/09/15/1126750082623.html "War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries"] ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' 16 September 2005. Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan accused City of Melbourne of political censorship and appeasing Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/09/14/1126377376345.html "City council bans 'terror artwork'"] ''The Age,'' 15 September 2005. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's areas of special interests ironically include [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 "Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725155111/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 |date=25 July 2008 }} ''City of Melbourne,'' Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monash University ===
[[Monash University Art and Design Faculty]] in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video ''Mind the Gap'' in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored ''Canberra's 18'' work. The video contained graphic footage of the [[beheading]] of British contractor [[Kenneth Bigley]] by [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for his role in the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html "Azlan McLennan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520005543/http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html |date=20 May 2008 }} ''un Magazine,'' Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005]], particularly the controversial return to the crime of [[sedition]] introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 "Artists 'at risk' under terror laws"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627104653/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 |date=27 June 2006 }} ''NineMSN,'' 8 November 2005. Accessed 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Art ===
City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister [[Bob Cameron (Victorian politician)|Bob Cameron]] censored ''Pay Your Way'' in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters – part of the Urbanart ARI program – were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]], a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, [[Joseph T. Thomas|Jack Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fare-game-shelters-feel-the-brush-of-protest/2006/01/09/1136771500463.html "Fare game!

Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet McLennan claimed the works were satirising the post [[9-11]] racism and Islamophobia perpetuated by pro-US governments. McLennan is also a [[Muslim]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=266&amp;Itemid=106 "Political art meets a paranoid state"] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 99, February 2006.

Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trocadero Art Space ===
Only weeks after the ''Pay Your Way'' affair, McLennan's ''Proudly UnAustralian'' was removed by the [[Victoria Police]] in Melbourne. The exhibition – featuring a burnt Australian flag – took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 [[Australia Day]] in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MP [[Bronwyn Bishop]] who attempted to introduce a ban on [[Flag desecration|flag burning]], and the national president of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]]. [[Free speech]] advocates such as the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on [[civil rights]]. This took place only a few short months after the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] and fuelled the broader debate about [[racism in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm "Art prompts call for flag-burning law change"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040610/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm |date=11 February 2006 }} ''The 7.30 Report'' (Transcript), 6 February 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Centre for Contemporary Art ===
McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine [[Crikey]]. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/power-of-one/2006/08/31/1156817027357.html "Power of one"] ''The Age,'' 1 September 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anna Schwartz Gallery ===
McLennan featured in ''Rules of Engagement'' at Melbourne ARI West Space in May 2007, which dealt with "relationships, power and exchange within the art system" according to the show's curator Mark Feary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westspace.org.au/projects/rules-of-engagement.html?Itemid=0 "Rules of Engagement"] ''West Space'' (Catalogue Essay), May 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan's contribution, ''Art in a Capitalist Society'' depicted an authoritative picture of leading private Australian gallerist Anna Schwartz, linked to a quote about [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] from the [[Karl Marx]] treatise ''[[Das Kapital]]''. Schwartz has previously criticised McLennan&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt; and some have accused McLennan of taking revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/artists-dish-it-out-to-the-dealers/2007/06/14/1181414455138.html "Artists dish it out to the dealers"] ''The Age,'' 15 June 2007. Accessed 25 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Melbourne ===
In a July 2009, ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'' interview, McLennan attacked the [[University of Melbourne]] over the merger with the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], the [[Melbourne Model]], the liquidation of the [[Victorian College of the Arts Student Union|VCA Student Union]] and likened the Vice-chancellor, [[Glyn Davis]]' perceived political censorship to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s use of [[Nazi art|Fascist Art]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s use of [[Socialist Realism]]. He also depicted Davis and the Provost, [[Peter McPhee (academic)|Peter McPhee]], as [[Sex Pistols]] musicians, [[Johnny Rotten]] and [[Sid Vicious]] in a parody of the [[Sex Pistols#Never Mind the Bollocks|Never Mind the Bollocks]] album cover as well as depicting Davis as the violent [[psychopath]], [[Alex DeLarge]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film adaptation of [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;"Report on the death of the VCA" ''Farrago,'' Edition 5, July 2009, p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan had previously attacked Davis and the university administration as the former General Secretary of the VCA Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1659&amp;Itemid=106 Smashing jobs, courses and student unions: A 2020 vision?] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 128, May 2008.

It is listed at item 84 as "Bastar Wooden Craft" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several old chocolate boxes and postcards depict this particular building, calling it variously the Hall House and an "Old [[Cottage]]".]]
'''Chocolate box art''' originally referred literally to [[Decorative arts|decorations]] on [[chocolate]] boxes. Over the years, however, the terminology has changed; it is now applied broadly as an often pejorative term to describe [[painting]]s and [[design]]s that are overly idealistic and sentimental.

Using his own paintings of children, flowers and holiday scenes [[Richard Cadbury]], the son of the founder of [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury's]], introduced such designs to his chocolate boxes in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadbury.co.uk/cadburyandchocolate/ourstory/packaging/Pages/richardcadbury.aspx "Cadbury chocolate box"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074709/http://www.cadbury.co.uk/cadburyandchocolate/ourstory/packaging/Pages/richardcadbury.aspx |date=2009-05-20 }}. [[Cadbury]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s paintings have been described as "chocolate box" and have been derided by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] for being happy, inoffensive scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan (12 February 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/12/art.features11 "Angry young man"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Constable|Constable]]'s landscapes have also been so described.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/05/25/lanscapes_of_gl.html "Landscapes of gloom"].

[[Aelbert Cuyp]]'s ''[[Media:Aelbert Cuyp River Landscape.jpg|River Landscape]]'' (1660), despite being widely regarded as his best work, has been criticised as having "chocolate box blandness".&lt;ref&gt;Denny, Ned (18 March 2002). [http://www.newstatesman.com/200203180037 "Cuyp cake"]. ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Swan]] is a modern-day proponent of chocolate box paintings as, to his detractors, was [[Thomas Kinkade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kinkade-king-of-kitsch-coming-to--a-home-near-you-683724.html| title=Kinkade, king of kitsch, coming to a home near you

The term has also been applied to [[sculpture]].

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]]. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith|first=N.S. |last2=Whitfield|first2=T.W.A. |last3=Wiltshire|first3=T.J. |date=April 1990 |title=The accuracy of the NCS, DIN, and OSA-UCS colour atlases |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=111–116 |doi=10.1002/col.5080150209 |issn=0361-2317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even within the same culture in different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Color psychology and color therapy: a factual study of the influence of color on human life |last=Birren |first=Faber |date=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1425424107 |location=Whitefish, MT |oclc=74452551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis.

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‐Cultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

[[image:sch_ewf_6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of a color wash in multiple hues]]
A '''color wash''' is a popular technique in [[faux painting]] using [[paint]] thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] to create a subtle wash of color over walls or other surfaces.  

Color washing is an easy and forgiving form of faux finishing often used by beginners, but perfected by professional finishers.  It was historically created with oil-based products because of the long drying time, but today's environmental and health conscious companies are producing user-friendly water based glazes.  Color washing can be done in any color of paint and is generally applied with brushes over a solid paint color, using long sweeping strokes to meld the glaze colors together.

'''Commesso also known as Florentine Commesso''', also referred to as '''Florentine mosaic''', is a method of piecing together cut sections of luminous, narrow [[gemstones]] to form works of art.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica#1994–present|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1998). Art – [https://www.britannica.com/art/commesso "Commesso"]. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc.]] Accessed March 03, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise patterns are cut into a slab of (generally black) [[marble]]. Gems are then cautiously cut and meticulously inlaid  into these patterns. The work is then [[Polishing|polished]] section by section, as it cannot be polished as a whole due to gems having different hardnesses.&lt;ref name="COUA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts: Mechanical and Chemical, Manufactures, Mining and Engineering|Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts: &lt;small&gt;Mechanical and Chemical, Manufactures, Mining and Engineering&lt;/small&gt;]] | title=Mosaic | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZU9AQAAMAAJ | editor=Tomlinson, Charles | publisher=[[J.

The assembly between each pieces is made using glue made with a mixture of virgin wax and colophony. The Master personally follow the whole creative process and all mosaics are completely produced in the laboratory

The practice, which began in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy, dates back to at least the 14th century and gained  prominence just before the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica" /&gt; Some of its uses include making pictures and decorating furniture and architecture.

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

The [[Alexamenos graffito]], currently in the museum in the [[Palatine Hill]], Rome, is a Roman [[Graffiti|graffito]] from the 2nd century CE which depicts a man worshiping a crucified donkey.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

=== Eastern church ===
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|250px|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], 586 CE]]
Early depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution.&lt;ref name=Dreyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kevin Seasoltz ,''A Sense Of The Sacred: Theological Foundations Of Christian Architecture And Art'', 2005, Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|church in Ireland]], important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where [[Saint Patrick]], returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7yFjie05bcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+of+saint+columba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEvvnbkZLNAhUE44MKHQECA3oQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick&amp;f=false Life of St Columba], Penguin books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

Crucifixion has appeared repeatedly as a theme in many forms of [[modern art]].

The [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] painted ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', representing the cross as a [[hypercube]].

Other artists have used crucifixion imagery as a form of protest. In 1974, [[Chris Burden]] had himself crucified to a [[Volkswagen]].

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

== Passion plays ==
[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures |title=Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate' pictures |work=[[The Local]] |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sentenced: Swedish Artist Dan Park "Incited Against an Ethnic Group" | url = http://hyperallergic.com/154676/sentenced-swedish-artist-dan-park-incited-against-an-ethnic-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against [[political correctness]] in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about [[freedom of speech]] that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Parks forbudte billeder vises på Christiansborg i dag | publisher=Politiken | url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/ECE2432649/dan-parks-forbudte-billeder-vises-paa-christiansborg-i-dag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[folklore]] a '''fairy path''' (or 'passage', 'avenue', or 'pass') is a route taken by fairies usually in a straight line and between sites of traditional significance, such as [[fairy fort]]s or [[Ringfort|raths]] (a class of circular earthwork dating from the [[Iron Age]]), "airy" (eerie) mountains and hills, thorn bushes, springs, lakes, rock outcrops, and Stone Age monuments. [[Ley line]]s and spirit paths, such as with [[corpse road]]s, have some similarities with these fairy paths.  A [[fairy ring]] is also a path used by fairies, but in a circle, for dancing, as described by poet [[W. B. Yeats]], "...the fairies dance in a place apart, Shaking their milk-white feet in a ring,..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth, Air, Fire, Water|last=Skelton| first=Robin|others= Margaret Blackwood| page= 181|publisher=Arkana, Penguin Group| year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is usually associated with [[Gaelic folklore (disambiguation)|Celtic folklore]], especially that of Ireland.

==Fairy paths and dwellings==
In some parts of Ireland, Brittany and Germany&lt;ref&gt;''Ley Lines: the Greatest Landscape Mystery'' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}; p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; there were fairy or spirit paths that while being invisible nevertheless had such perceived geographical reality in the minds of the country people that building practices were adapted to ensure they were not obstructed. A significant number of the characteristics of fairy paths are shared in common with [[ley line]]s. In many parts of Northern Europe the [[tumulus|round barrow]]s were the traditional homes of the [[fairies]], [[elves]], or [[trolls]] and were avoided by the country folk. Such places were Fairy Toot in [[Somerset]], Elf Howe barrow near [[Folkton]], Yorkshire, and a round barrow at [[Beedon]] in Berkshire. [[Cornwall]] was and is a stronghold of fairy lore: fairies are said to dance on [[Ballowall Barrow|Carn Gluze]], near [[St Just in Penwith]].&lt;ref name ="Bord72"&gt;Bord, Janet &amp; Colin (1973) ''Mysterious Britain''. Garnstone Press. {{ISBN|0-85511-180-1}}; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In Danish [[Jutland]] there was a belief that "Barrow-folk" dwelt in barrows and were descendants of [[fallen angel]]s cast out of [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name=northmyth&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; pp. 115–124&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it was considered bad luck to let cattle graze on any place where the Elf-folk have been, or to let the cattle mingle with the large blue cattle of the elves. However, all evils may be averted if one were to ask at an "Elf-barrow" for permission to graze cattle on their mound.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; Some Danish "Elf-barrows" included one near Galtebjerg, another not far from [[Kalundborg]]; one between [[Thisted]] and [[Aalborg]] that was said to be the home of an elfin [[Smithing|smith]]; two near [[Sundby, Copenhagen|Sundby]] where a troll-smith would ride from one to the other followed by his apprentices and journeymen; and one at Tröstrup where according to legend a giant was buried, and it was said his daughter wandered across the fields and one day met a ploughman whom she took back to her father who then set the man free, fearing that they'd be driven out of their barrow.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; In [[Sweden]] similar beliefs existed and one barrow called ''Helvetesbacke'' (''"Hell's mouth"'') that lies near Kråktorps gård, [[Småland]], was claimed to be the burial mound of [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany the [[Wild Hunt|Wild Troop of Rodenstein]] was said to ride a straight path between the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellert. Also throughout Europe are [[Corpse roads]], which are generally believed to be of the same basic belief as ''fairy paths'' and most likely share an origin.&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and the [[Netherlands]] in particular, these tend to be straight invisible lines and are known by a variety of names including ''Geisterweg'' ("ghost-way" or "ghost-road") and ''Helweg'' ("hell-way" or "hell-road") in German&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}, pages. 101–103&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Doodweg'' ("death-way" or "death-road") in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}, page. 189&lt;/ref&gt; A similarly straight road did however run straight over various burial mounds at Rösaring, [[Lassa, Sweden|Lassa]] in southern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005

==Consequences of blocking fairy paths==
[[File:Fairy Ring 0004.JPG|thumb|right|180px|&lt;center&gt;A [[Fairy Ring]] of mushrooms&lt;center&gt;]]
In Ireland, people who had illnesses or other misfortune, were said to live in houses that were "in the way" or in a "contrary place", obstructing a fairy path. An example is that of a family in which four children sickened and died, leaving the doctors baffled. The fifth child sickened and was near death, only to make a sudden and full recovery. The father told the doctor that he had consulted a wise woman who informed him that his new house extension blocked a fairy path between two fairy forts, whereupon he demolished it and his child became healthy again.&lt;ref name="Bord27"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. [[Paul Elek]], London. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ängsälvor - Nils Blommér 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Fairies of the meadow, by [[Nils Blommér]]]]
An example of this fairy path straightness is provided by an account concerning a croft (now a cattle shed) at Knockeencreen, [[Brosna, County Kerry]]. In an interview in the 1980s, the last human occupant told of the troubles his grandfather had experienced there, with his cattle periodically and inexplicably dying. The front door is exactly opposite the back door. The grandfather was informed by a passing Gypsy that the dwelling stands on a fairy path running between two hills. The Gypsy advised the grandfather to keep the doors slightly ajar at night to allow the fairies free passage. The advice was heeded and the problem ceased. It so happens that the building is indeed on a straight line drawn between two local hilltops, and is, moreover, at one end of a long, straight track.&lt;ref name="Fortean"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html Where the Leylines led] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913113534/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html |date=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wentz38"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairies processed from Rath Ringlestown in Ireland every night and parents brought their children in before the fairies were due to pass. The path passed round several bushes which were left undisturbed by the locals. A man who cut down one bush could not get it to burn and sickened and died within a short while as a supposed consequence of his actions. The route also passed between two mud-wall houses and a man who was out at the wrong time was found dead; the fairies having taken him for getting in the way of the procession.&lt;ref name="Wentz38"/&gt;
A traditional folk tale from the Southern Shore of Newfoundland, Canada, concerns a young married couple who discovered that they had built their house on a path used by the good people, and the steps that couple take to rid themselves of fairy mischief. It seems therefore that the fairy folk had emigrated together with their human counterparts or had been in Canada from time immemorial.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DaleJarvisTheHouseOnTheFairyPath.  Newfoundland Fairy Path.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home-owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path,&lt;ref name="Silver-hiding"&gt;Silver, Carole G. (1999) Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness. Oxford University Press. p.47 {{ISBN|0-19-512199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cottages have been built with the front and back doors in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night.&lt;ref&gt;Lenihan, Eddie and Green, Carolyn Eve (2004) ''Meeting The Other Crowd:  The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland''. pp.146–7 {{ISBN|1-58542-206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that a house built on a fairy path would suffer from midnight noises or supernatural manifestations. Ill-luck in the form of sick farm animals or personal illness could be the result and one remedy was to build small fires in several places along the fairy path, using fire from the blessed fire of [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Saint John]]'s Eve that was lit every year at sunset on 23 June.&lt;ref name="Bord"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. Paul Elek, London. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. pp. 26 – 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detecting fairy paths and overcoming their influence==
[[File:Fairychapeltoun.JPG|Thumb|right|150px]]
Some builders used to use a technique to see if the planned construction was going to be on a fairy path; they would map out the floor plan in the earth and place a pile of stones at each corner and leave it overnight, if the stones were undisturbed it was safe to build, otherwise the work would not continue. There is another theme that states if one's house is on a fairy path, one must leave the doors and windows open at night, front and back, to allow fairies to pass through. Builders were also advised against using white quartz in their stonework, as it is said to be a fairy stone.&lt;ref name="Maljonic"&gt;[http://www.maljonicsdreams.com/Dream_Spells/fairy_paths.htm Maljonic's Fairy Paths]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise-women were thought to be able to advise home builders of the existence of fairy paths, however in most folk-tales they are only consulted after the event and as a result of disturbances, bad luck, etc.

A building placed on a fairy path would be demolished by the fairy folk, at least twice, often remaining standing however on the third attempt.&lt;ref name="Wentz67"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking along fairy paths==
Paths that the fairies travel along are usually stated as being best avoided, however they also had certain benefits to humans, such as with [[Trod|'trods']] in the West of England. These are a straight-line fairy path in the grass of a field with a different shade of green to the rest. People with rheumatism sought relief by walking along these tracks, though animals avoid them. Great danger was still very much associated with using these paths at times when a supernatural procession might be using them. [[Fairy ring]]s have certain elements in common with this phenomenon and were seen as 'gateways' into the realm of supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996132"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tylwyth teg]] of Wales have paths on which it is death for a mortal to walk.&lt;ref name="Wentz150"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Ankou]], who is king of the dead, and his subjects have their own particular paths along which they process.&lt;ref name="Wentz218"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underwater fairy paths ==
Irish fairy paths are said to also exist under water, reminiscent of causeways in marshes at sacred sites and those to [[crannog]]s and other islands. These paths, only used by the fairy folk, ran from one island to another and were paved with coral, making them and their travellers visible to fishermen in their boats above.&lt;ref name="Pennick199613"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and traditional [[culture]] transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts give way to a distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.

Family folklore has long been included in the documentation of the folklore of regional, ethnic, religious or occupational groups.&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore"&gt;Margaret R. Yocum (1997). "Family Folklore", pg. 279. In ''Folklore An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'', ed. Thomas Green. California / ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only since the 1970s that this lore has also been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. Heralded by a call from Mody Boatright to document the "family saga" in 1958,&lt;ref name="Boatright"&gt;Mody C. Boatright (1958). "The Family Saga as a Form of Folklore". In ''The Family Saga and Other Phases of American Folklore'', eds. Mody C. Boatright, Robert B. Downs, and John T. Flanagan. Urbana / University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; folklorists responded with published accounts of stories and traditions passed down in their own families.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Kim S. Garrett (1961), "Family Stories and Sayings", pp 273–281. In ''Publications of the Texas Folklore Society'', Vol. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Karen Baldwin’s unpublished dissertation (1975)&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;L. Karen Baldwin (1975). ''Down on Bugger Run: Family Group and the Social Base of Folklore''. University of Pennsylvania / Unpublished Dissertation. &lt;/ref&gt; laid further theoretical groundwork for family folklore "… not only is the family a folk group, it is the first folk group anyone belongs to."&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Polly Stewart (2008), "Karen Baldwin (1943 - 2007)", pp. 485–486. In ''Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 121, Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field has since blossomed, broadening to include an ever expanding understanding of family. The conventional extended family, consisting of a heterosexual married couple with children and grandparents now incorporates gay partners, unmarried committed relationships and children adopted or born through non-traditional methods and procedures. The family traditions themselves are transformed to meet the needs and expectations of these new members and new relationships. 

The study of family folklore is distinct from family [[genealogy]] or family history. Instead of focusing on historical dates, locations and verifiable events, its unique stories, customs and handicrafts identify the family as a distinct social group. At the same time, the family lore passed along has been molded and transformed to relay a sense of family identity and set of values both within and without the family group. The family lore defines the family story.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;For an individual family, folklore is its creative expression of a common past. As raw experiences are transformed into family stories, expression, and photos, they are codified in forms which can easily be recalled, retold, and enjoyed. Their drama and beauty are heightened, and the family’s past becomes accessible as it is reshaped according to its needs and desires. … Its stories, photographs, and traditions are personalized and often creative distillations of experience, worked and reworked over time.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;Steven J. Zeitlin, Amy J. Kotkin, and Holly Cutting Baker (1993). ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection'', pg. 2. Cambridge / Yellow Moon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Family as a folk group ==
A new baby is born or a child is adopted into an established [[family]] group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances.&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt; [[Barre Toelken]] (1996). ''The Dynamics of Folklore'', pp 196–197. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims"&gt; Sims, Martha C., Martine Stephens (2005). ''Living Folklore'', pg 31. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is "the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore" /&gt;

The dynamics of family folklore remain unsettled not only through the addition of newborns and adoptions, but more particularly by the regular incorporation of new adult family members through each marriage or committed relationship. In the formation of each new family node, a unique subset and combination of the customs and traditions of both families is incorporated into a new story, both modifying and enriching the current family lore. 

As part of the ongoing national discussion of "family" and what it means, family folklore redefines itself as well. Along with the classic family "father-mother-child(ren)", it expands to include single-parent families, blended families, communes, gay and lesbian families. The indicator for family now includes any group which self-identifies as a family based on intimacy, shared space and shared history. Any collection of adults and children in a committed relationship which sees itself as "us", unique and separate from other families, will develop and transmit stories and customs which are unique. Non-traditional families frequently strive to re-establish and re-enact traditional family customs and lore. This becomes a demonstration both to themselves and to outsiders that they are indeed a family of "tradition".

== Transmission ==
The transmission of individual stories and customs within a family depends for the most part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The transmission of individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as "multi-conduit transmission".&lt;ref name="Dégh"&gt;Linda Dégh and Andrew Vázsonyi (1975). "Hypothesis of Multi-Conduit Transmission in Folklore", pp. 207–255. In ''Folklore. Performance and Communication'', ed. Dan Ben-Amos. Den Haag, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family.   

There are multiple spheres within the family and household which are "traditionally" defined as in the purview of one gender or the other, making an intersection with [[gender studies]] manifest. The transmission of the folklore in these areas will run through either the male or the female lines. An obvious area of gender-related transmission is seen in the kitchen, where food preparation and mealtime customs and forms are generally performed by the women. They are then transmitted from mother to daughter in the course of everyday meal preparation. A variant of this is seen when a man in the family has taken over the preparation of a special meal or special recipe. One common example of this practice is described by Thomas Adler in the article "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition".&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Thomas A. Adler (1981). "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition", pp. 45–55. In ''Western Folklore'', Vol. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many families have some variation of this tradition: the BBQ ribs, grilled hamburgers, or deep-fat fried turkey prepared as a single specialty by the non-cook in the family.

A different gender-related variation in folklore transmission is seen in storytelling. The same story will be shaped and told differently by a man and a woman, even though they were both present at the original event. For an event occurring during the apple harvest, a woman’s narration might include details of the apple butter recipe they were cooking up at the time. In contrast, the man's narration gives only enough detail to "make a point worth telling". This gender-based variance has been studied by both Baldwin and Margaret Yocum within individual family groups. They found "… women's telling to be more collaborative, interruptible, and filled with information and genealogy; men's telling, by contrast, is often uninterrupted and more competitive."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore2"&gt; Margaret Yocum, Family Folklore, pg. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within families, there is also a notable tendency toward traditional deference where one family member becomes the designated performer for a specific custom or tradition, even though it is known to everyone within the family group. So it happens that when the "last basketmaker" dies, another member will step up to become "the last basketmaker".&lt;ref name="Toelken" /&gt; No one else performs this tradition as long as the designated tradition bearer is available, acknowledging this individual as the (current) keeper of this tradition. Only when this person is no longer available will the tradition be picked up by someone else to carry forward. "Traditional deference" can be found in many folk groups, but is particularly evident within the family group.

== Detritus of family lore ==
If the family lore which is picked up and transmitted represents the chosen familial beliefs and values, then family stories, documents and photographs which do not support and enhance these values become problematic. For the most part news clipping on arrests, photographs of the uncle who deserted the family, stories of a sister who cheated, or dishonorable discharge papers will not be saved. That is not the family story this family wants to preserve. 

Family traditions are also lost or modified in response to difficult events within the family. This is obvious when one of the tradition bearers has died. If no one else steps up to own that tradition, a hole is left in the celebration and this tradition is lost. In a divorce there is also frequently the loss of a parent no longer available to play his or her role in the established traditions. In response to this event, one family decided to change the traditions. The customary tall Christmas tree decorated by the (missing) tall father was traded in for a short tree which the children could decorate. Ornaments were discarded and new ones purchased. The toy train was no longer set up.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg 170.&lt;/ref&gt; These became the new traditions for the Christmas celebration, modified to support and tell the new family story. 

Another reason family folklore might be suppressed or lost is when the references are too painful at the present time or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found photo albums and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history.&lt;ref name="Noren"&gt;Catherine Noren (1976). ''The Camera of My Family''. New York / Knopf, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came to know her family story.

== Forms ==
It is only since the 1970s that family folklore has been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. As part of this investigation, the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] in Washington, D.C. set up a tent for several years&lt;ref&gt;From 1974–1978&lt;/ref&gt; to collect the family lore of visitors to the Festival. The goal was to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Using the taped interviews collected, representative pieces have been published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; Despite its lack of performance data, this collection provides a solid overview of the wide range of family folklore forms. 

=== Family stories and sayings === 
A '''family story''' initially recounts an actual historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned with time and re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally take the form of an [[anecdote]] and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;For further examples including traditional heroes, rogues, survivors, migrants and more, see Zeitlin, pp. 10–125.&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Another family tells how the young couple got stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 96. &lt;/ref&gt; Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.

The setting for telling family stories becomes part of the tradition. It can include the family occasions where stories are told, the location and prompt for the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories.  Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves as an integral part of the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into the kitchen. At some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Riedel family from Freiburg, Germany. Recorded October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of verbal lore common within family groups is the unique '''family expression''' or [[saying]]. A saying can be created at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying "… good worker, very strong" signifies that the speaker wants to come along, and would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Wiley family from Seattle. Recorded June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 146 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photos, letters, journals and other papers ===
Papers stacked, bundled or boxed: news clippings, photographs, letters, scrawled notes, journals, receipts. These pages of family artifacts take many forms, and have become a significant part of family archival materials. Frequently jumbled together in cardboard boxes, they commonly pose a problem as to their value-add to the family story. The boxes are passed along until they are either thrown out in a move, destroyed in a fire, or find an owner within the family,&lt;ref name="Dégh"/&gt; someone with the interest and time to house and evaluate them. 

The largest collection of papers is frequently the photographs, either kept in a drawer or labeled and organized into albums. Singly each photo documents only a single moment; taken together they comprise an important visual history of the family. Either way, they serve as triggers for more extensive memories, stories and events in the life of this family. They are brought out at gatherings and used to commemorate lifetime events such as a wedding or funeral. 

Noteworthy is the consistency in which American families of all ethnic backgrounds tend to have photographs of the same milestones. Naked babies on carpets or in the wading pool, the first day of school, the birthday cake surrounded by family and guests, generational portraits gathered around the new baby can be found in many family albums.&lt;ref&gt;see Zeitlin, pg. 184 ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pictorial repetition by American families of all backgrounds and traditions documents the universality of family photography as an important custom. 

As with storytelling, the occasion for photo-taking becomes a family tradition in and of itself. Year after year, the same pictures are snapped; documenting a family which is growing and changing, adding and subtracting members, detailing a new location. The camera can be as much a part of the celebration as the birthday cake or the menorah.  

The ubiquity of cameras and on-line photos since the rise of cellphone cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is to put together a slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration. At this time a folklorist can only speculate on evolving customs of family photography.   

Some families have also amassed over decades a collection of letters and other papers written by or about family members. One family, in sorting through boxes of papers, discovered all diplomas for family members from 2nd grade Sunday School up through doctoral degrees. Other family documents include the family Bible, military enlistment or discharge papers and Certificates of Baptism. While certificates authenticate the dates and events in the family history, letters and journals are particularly revealing as to the character and thoughts of individual family members. 

Similar to photographs, letters and journal entries document a single day in the life of a family member. Once these papers have been saved, it falls to members of the following generations to evaluate them. Are they to be preserved as part of the family story or discarded as inconsequential or even damaging to the family? For the most part unfavorable documents are discarded; that is not the family story this family wants to save.

The introduction of emails, IMs and other electronic messaging means that paper documents of family history are no longer regularly generated. Seldom is electronic communication printed out for the family files. The 19th and 20th centuries, providing access both to widespread literacy and to resources to create and preserve paper documents might mean that these forms of family history and lore are themselves becoming history.

=== Family customs ===
Each family has its own traditions, played out year after year, event after event. These traditions are frequently so engrained that the recognition of them as unique to this family only occurs when compared to other families.  This is also an area of family folklore that is most exposed to change or modification. With each additional marriage or committed relationship, a new member from a different family gets added, an individual who does not recognize the family customs as "traditional". These new members bring their own traditions which need to be reconciled, perhaps added or even substituted into the current performance. Not only through marriage, but births and deaths also add a fluid dynamic to the family traditions. When the first grandchild is born, everyone moves into a new role, Mom becomes Grandmom, Brother becomes Uncle, and the family Benjamin loses his position to the new baby. These factors lead to a dynamic development of new and renewed family traditions. 

One major and understudied area of family traditions is found in [[foodways]], which includes everything involved in the procurement, preparation, serving and eating of daily meals at home.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Owen Jones (1983). ''Foodways and Eating Habits: Directions for Research Paperback''. California Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[American Folklore Society]] has a section dedicated completely to Foodways. Many other scholarly groups also consider the study of food traditions as part of their domain, including Gender Studies, Ethnic Studies, Ethnology as well as modern findings on [[Nutrition and Health]]. &lt;/ref&gt; Most of us go home each evening for dinner, wake up for breakfast and pack up a lunch or snack pack to take with us for the day. All the assumptions about how this occurs, who does what when arise only when the established process (i.e. family custom) hits a snag: we've run out of milk or someone ate the last of the cookies. Maybe Dad is off on a trip and can't make the Sunday morning pancakes.&lt;ref name="Adler"/&gt; Each of these food customs is understood and accepted by the group as a whole, and followed as a matter of course with little or no discussion. 

It is also customary that family mealtimes differ: breakfast food differs from supper and snacks, weekends frequently vary from the weekday diet. In one busy family a scoop of ice cream on the breakfast cereal turned the meal into an easy, fun supper. There might also be a traditional Sunday Dinner to be prepared and staged weekly with an expanded family group gathered around the table. 

Holidays and "life event" celebrations, from birthdays to wakes include multiple family customs, either superimposed upon the more broadly defined societal celebrations, or substituting for them. This is seen most obviously in traditions found in the preparation and "performance" of a holiday meal. Each family has their own unique traditions, from special dishes prepared only for this dinner, to a single individual who prepares and presents this single dish, to the individual assigned to carve the bird. It is unnecessary to mention examples of this; each North American reader is mentally reviewing the [[Thanksgiving]] traditions unique to his own family. This list of special holiday traditions in the family expands easily from the dining table to the family wake-up calls to the distribution of presents under the Christmas tree or Hanukah lights. Each of these, along with countless other details, distinguish this family as a unique social unit.  

Another significant family tradition is that of naming customs. When a new baby is born, incorporating family names into the name for the new baby, or conversely not using family names for the next generation, can become problematic. What rules should be followed? Many ethnic groups have their own naming customs, variations of which might be found within the separate family groups of the parents. There are also differing ethnic customs of who has the authority to pick the name for the baby. When published lists of currently popular names along with expectations of individual family members are added to this mix, it can become a challenge to craft a name which pleases everyone.  

=== Handicrafts and memorabilia ===
All possessions are considered pieces of [[material culture]] - objects with which members of a culture customarily surround themselves. However, only handicrafts produced by family members and memorabilia passed along through generations are of interest in family folklore. 

[[Memorabilia]] are singular objects which are passed down through the family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll was included in the Christmas celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 203. &lt;/ref&gt; Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family [[heirloom]]. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.

[[Handicrafts]] are objects which have been "homemade", crafted individually using simple tools by one or more family members. The production skills for these artisanal crafts are generally transmitted within the family; the items might include weaving, welding, pottery, woodworking, quilting, basketry, cooking. They can be used functionally or as decoration in the home. Over time these handicrafts becomes a skill nurtured within the family, as well as a point of family identification for outsiders. The family cultivates both the production knowledge and the objects themselves. 

One aspect of these objects, both family memorabilia and handicrafts, is that they are for the most part one-of-a-kind. Many family members can tell the story of the Christmas doll, or have the family photographs, but only one family branch can actually possess the doll. For handicrafts, a craftsman could decide to create a quilt or a rocking chair for each child in a family. But this just postpones the decision of ownership of the item to the following generation.  

Each of these material objects carries along with its stories or memories the ability for family members to experience [[simultaneity]] in the home. "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times of our lives and our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present."&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406900153.html Jill Terry Rudy &lt;/ref&gt; The candy bowl on the coffee table or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family. 

== Institutions involved in study of family folklore == 
=== [[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]] ===
1967 marked the first [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]], set up on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to exhibit and demonstrate crafts and customs of diverse ethnic, regional and occupational groups. Originally including only displays from the United States, it later expanded to include traditions and customs from around the world. Each exhibit at the festival endeavors to move beyond the items of tangible culture, the arts and objects we can touch, feel and put in a glass case. Each unique performance or display at the Folklife Festival articulates the goal of the Smithsonian Institution to spread its reach beyond material objects to artifacts of [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folklife.si.edu/cultural-heritage-policy/ICH/about/smithsonian &lt;/ref&gt; Festival exhibits such as "The Changing Soundscape in Indian Country" (1992), "American Social Dance" (1993), "Mississippi Delta" (1997), "Asian Pacific Americans: Local Lives, Global Ties" (2010) are just a few of the exhibits included since the Festival began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival.si.edu/explore_festival/year.aspx Complete list of programs by year]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these cultural intangibles, including traditions of performance, ritual, music, dance, traditional knowledge, storytelling or oral transmission, is considered for inclusion at the festival. Its intention is to "legitimize and celebrate individual Americans and their traditions".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Open to the public at no cost, the festival is devised to enable each visitor to find at least one exhibit which relates to his background, narrates a segment of his story.
	
In 1974 a new tent was added to the Festival. Instead of displaying or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: "Family Folklore – Will You Share Yours With Us?"&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"/&gt;  Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, but he should also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage. 

During the four years that the tent was included at the festival, it gradually cluttered with objects, memorabilia and photos just like any family home. Taking the taped interviews as a baseline, the stories and customs collected in the tent were used to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Representative pieces were then published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; This collection continues to be supported by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/center-folklife-and-cultural-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Library of Congress. 

Since this first Smithsonian Folklife Festival, many [[List of folk festivals#USA|regional festivals]] have been established in all parts of the country. These include the [[Northwest Folklife]] Festival, the [[New England Folk Festival]] and the [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] to name just a few.  Each of these is supported by various institutions of [[public folklore]], with the goal of displaying traditions of regional, ethnic and occupational folk groups. None of them however has duplicated the Smithsonian Folklore tent intended to collect original family folklore.

=== Oral history and oral tradition projects ===
[[Oral history]] and [[oral tradition]] first became recognized as legitimate forms of historical and cultural research in the 1960s and early 1970s. Pioneers in this field used newly developed inexpensive tape-recorders to record oral histories.  A Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Studs Terkel]] in 1985 for his book ''"The Good War": An Oral History of World War II'' and a special Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Alex Haley]] in 1977 for ''Roots: The Saga of an American Family''. With these awards, the importance of oral histories and traditions as a bona fide tool of historical and cultural research was cemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/oral+history "Oral history"] ''Columbia Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical and folklore research using oral interviews has gone mainstream, with multiple organizations dedicated to its collection. One of the best known organizations is [[StoryCorps]], founded in 2003 and modeled on the WPA [[Federal Writers Project]]. Its expressed mission is to "record, preserve, and share stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs". Special projects reach out to targeted populations to fulfill StoryCorps' commitment to record a diverse array of voices. The only requirement for the 2-person interview is that the 2 participants "care about each other", for instance family members. The participants are given a recording of the interview to take with them and add to the family archive. 

StoryCorps is just one of many organizations with a goal of recording and preserving interviews of oral history and tradition. Other organizations abound, such as [[City Lore]] of New York City and the [[Oral History Society]] of London.

'''Frank Vincent Zappa'''{{refn|group=nb|Until discovering his birth certificate as an adult, Zappa believed he had been christened "Francis Vincent Zappa" after his father, and he is credited as Francis on some of his early albums. The name on his birth certificate however is "Frank", not "Francis".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|15}}}} (December 21, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, activist and filmmaker. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; In a career spanning more than 30&amp;nbsp;years, Zappa composed [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], [[orchestra]]l and ''[[musique concrète]]'' works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band [[&lt;!--Do not capitalize--&gt;the Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-zappa-mn0000138699/biography|title=Frank Zappa {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Sterling|title=The Day Frank Zappa Died|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/frank-zappa-death/|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maume|first1=Chris|title=Gail Zappa: Frank Zappa's wife, muse and manager who ferociously protected his musical legacy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gail-zappa-frank-zappas-wife-muse-and-manager-who-ferociously-protected-his-musical-legacy-a6691251.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], along with 1950s [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckley|first1=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Rock: [The Definitive Guide to More Than 1200 Artists and Bands]|date=November 17, 2003|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|page=1211|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional [[rock and roll]] format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound [[collage]]s. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.

Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; His lyrics reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so. Zappa's often comedic lyrics led [[AllMusic]] to describe him as the "godfather" of [[comedy rock]].&lt;ref name="Comedy rock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs and never used them again after briefly trying marijuana,&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rolling Stone Interview|year=1988|first=Kurt|last=Loder|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supported their decriminalization and regulation.

During Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]] for most of his career. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His honors include his 1995 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the 1997 [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. In 2000, he was ranked number 36 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8 VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him at number 71 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Artists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/frank-zappa-20110420|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/frank-zappa-20111122|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s–1960s: Early life and career==

===Childhood===
Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie ({{nee}} Collimore) was of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and [[French Americans|French]] ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from [[Partinico]], [[Sicily]], with [[Greek Americans|Greek]] and [[Arab Americans|Arab]]&lt;!-- do not change this to Lebanese: the cited source says Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French--&gt; ancestry.{{refn|group=nb|"My ancestry is Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French. My mother's mother was French and Sicilian, and her Dad was Italian (from Naples). She was first generation. The Greek-Arab side is from my Dad. He was born in a Sicilian village called Partinico&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zappa |first1=Frank |authorlink=Frank Zappa |last2=Occhiogrosso |first2=Peter |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |date=1989 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where [[Italian language|Italian]] was often spoken by his grandparents.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"&gt;''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|6}} The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood, Maryland|Edgewood]] Arsenal [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}} This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa| first = Barry| last = Miles| publisher=Atlantic Books| location = London| year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84354-092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[earache]]s and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|title=Nasopharyngeal Radium Irradiation (NRI) and Cancer|date=January 2003|work=National Cancer Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411012948/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|archivedate=April 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator [[Cal Schenkel]]. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|22}} They next moved to [[Monterey, California]], where his father taught [[metallurgy]] at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]. They soon moved to [[Claremont, California]],&lt;ref name=slaven03&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa|edition=2nd|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4EyfFjQ3DgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} then to [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], before finally settling in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiegotroubadour.com/wp-content/pdf/2005_11_Nov.pdf|format=PDF|title=Counter Culture Coincidence|work=San Diego Troubadour|last=Mendoza|first=Bart|page=4|date=November 11, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First musical interests===
{{quote box|quote=Since I didn't have any kind of formal training, it didn't make any difference to me if I was listening to Lightnin' Slim, or a vocal group called the Jewels&amp;nbsp;..., or Webern, or Varèse, or Stravinsky. To me it was all good music.|source= — Frank Zappa, 1989&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|34}}|width=25em}}

Zappa joined his first band at [[Mission Bay High School]] in San Diego as the drummer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} At about the same time, his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|22}} [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singles were early purchases, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|36}} He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began&lt;ref name="idol"/&gt; when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} The article described [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Varèse)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers. He also liked the Italian classical music listened to by his grandparents, especially [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera arias.

[[File:Frank Zappa HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa's senior yearbook photo, 1958]]
By 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; he would later refer to Sun Village (a town close to Lancaster) in the 1973 track "Village of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Roxy_and_Elsewhere.html#Village|title=Lyrics of Village Of The Sun|first=Frank|last=Zappa|date=December 1973|work=Village Of The Sun, Roxy and Elsewhere|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later. In a letter Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition he was working on called "[[Déserts]]". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="idol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Edgard Varese: The Idol of My Youth|journal=Stereo Review|pages=61–62|date=June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|On several of his earlier albums, Zappa paid tribute to Varèse by quoting his: "The present-day composer refuses to die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Friendly Remainders: Essays in Music Criticism after Adorno|first1=Murray|last1=Dineen|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7735-8576-8|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C&amp;pg=PA122 Extract of page 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Glen Vliet (who later changed his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]]). Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&amp;B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|29–30}} Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}} The band was racially diverse and included [[Jim Sherwood|Euclid James "Motorhead" Sherwood]] who later became a member of the Mothers of Invention. Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument. Among his early influences were [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. (In the 1970s/80s, he invited Watson to perform on several albums.) Zappa considered soloing as the equivalent of forming "air sculptures",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frank Zappa|first1=Barry|last1=Miles|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78239-678-9|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266 Extract of page 266]&lt;/ref&gt; and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z)|edition=illusdtrated|first1=Ben|last1=Watson|first2=Esther|last2=Leslie|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|year=2005|isbn=978-0-946719-79-2|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&amp;pg=PA223 Extract of page 223]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's interest in composing and arranging flourished in his last high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, [[arrangement|arranging]] and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|40}} He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album ''Freak Out!''&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|48}} In 1959, he attended [[Chaffey College]] but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|345}}

Zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], Los Angeles. After meeting Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman during his short period of private composition study with Prof. [[Karl Kohn]] of [[Pomona College]], they moved in together in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], and were married December 28, 1960.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa worked for a short period in advertising. His sojourn in the commercial world was brief, but gave him valuable insights into its workings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|40}} Throughout his career, he took a keen interest in the visual presentation of his work, designing some of his album covers and directing his own films and videos.

===Studio Z===
Zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|59}} Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films ''[[The World's Greatest Sinner]]'' (1962) and ''Run Home Slow'' (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer [[Timothy Carey]] and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|63}} The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|55}} Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996).

During the early 1960s, Zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] and producer Paul Buff. Their "[[Memories of El Monte]]" was recorded by [[the Penguins]], although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 1984, ''Mother!'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Buff owned the small [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|42}} Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|74}} He appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of the Soots. They were rejected by [[Dot Records]] for having "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref name=watson96&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 1996| publisher=St. Martin's Griffin| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-312-14124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

In 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the Pal studio and began routinely working 12&amp;nbsp;hours or more per day recording and experimenting with [[overdubbing]] and [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#As a musical instrument|audio tape manipulation]]. This established a work pattern that endured for most of his life.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|43}} Aided by his income from film composing, Zappa took over the studio from Paul Buff, who was now working with [[Art Laboe]] at [[Original Sound]]. It was renamed Studio Z.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|80–81}} Studio Z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. Instead, friends moved in, notably James "Motorhead" Sherwood.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|82–83}} Zappa started performing in local bars as a guitarist with a [[power trio]], the Muthers, to support himself.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

An article in the local press describing Zappa as "the Movie King of Cucamonga" prompted the local police to suspect that he was making [[pornography|pornographic]] films.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a [[Vice unit|vice squad]] undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1965|fmt=eq}}) to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged [[Bachelor party|stag party]]. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about to hand over the tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's ''[[The Daily Report]]'' wrote that "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harp |first=Ted |title=Vice Squad Raids Local Film Studio | newspaper=The Daily Report | place = Ontario, California | date = March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa was charged with "conspiracy to commit pornography".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|57}} This [[felony]] charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a [[misdemeanor]], with all but ten days suspended.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|86–87}} His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|xv}} Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|87}} Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|90–91}}

==Late 1960s: The Mothers of Invention==

===Formation===
In 1965, [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] asked Zappa to take over as guitarist in local R&amp;B band the Soul Giants, following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"/&gt; Zappa accepted, and soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer&lt;ref name="HighTimes1980"/&gt;). He convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|42}} They increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles [[underground music]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] when playing "Trouble Every Day", a song about the [[Watts riots]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|103}} Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], and was notable as one of the few African-Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed the Mothers to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] division of [[MGM Records|MGM]], which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves [[the Mothers of Invention]] as ''Mother'' was short for ''[[motherfucker]]''—a term that, apart from its profane meanings, can denote a skilled musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | people = Nigel Leigh | title = Interview with Frank Zappa | medium = BBC Late Show | publisher=BBC [TV Show] | location = UMRK, Los Angeles, CA |date=March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debut album: ''Freak Out!''===
With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), which, after Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock double album ever released. It mixed R&amp;B, [[doo-wop]], musique concrète,&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite book| title = The Words and Music of Frank Zappa| first = Kelly Fisher| last = Lowe| publisher=Praeger Publishers| location = Westport| year = 2006| isbn = 978-0-275-98779-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture of Los Angeles at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was dissatisfied with the final product, ''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|115}} The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs.&lt;ref name=watson05&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 2005| publisher=Omnibus Press| location = London| isbn = 978-1-84449-865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most [[Overdubbing|overdubs]]. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} Although Wilson was able to provide Zappa and the Mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. In a surviving 1967 radio interview, Zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was in fact an unfinished piece. The track (as it appears on the album) was created to act as the backing track for a much more complex work, but MGM refused to approve the additional recording time Zappa needed to complete it, so (much to his chagrin) it was issued in this unfinished form.&lt;ref&gt;"How We Made It Sound That Way", interview on WDET Detroit, November 13, 1967 (excerpt included as part of the [[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO]] album, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_HungryFreaks.ogg|description=The opening track on ''Freak Out!''. The album has "consistently been voted as one of top 100 greatest albums ever made".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|115}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;|title=Hungry Freaks Daddy|pos=left}}

During the recording of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa moved into a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] with friend Pamela Zarubica, who appeared on the album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and [[groupie]]s of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|122}} After a short promotional tour following the release of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa met [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]]. He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.

Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|5}} Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|38–43}} As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|135–38}} At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'', released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–41}} It is an "incredible ambitious musical project",&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|56}} a "monument to [[John Cage]]",&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical [[audio engineer|audio editing]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22630|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lumpy Gravy.

===New York period (1966–1968)===
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 [[Bleecker Street]], above the [[Cafe au Go Go]]) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, ''Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', pp. 62–69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–141}} Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|147}} Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|94}}

Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as [[AMM (group)|AMM]] and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}}|title=We're Only in It for the Money. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; He sampled plundered surf music in ''We're only in It for the Money'', as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song ''Tomorrow Never Knows''.&lt;ref&gt;Cox and Warner, 2004, ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover photo parodied that of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{refn|group=nb|As the legal aspects of using the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept were unsettled, the album was released with the cover and back on the inside of the gatefold, while the actual cover and back were a picture of the group in a pose parodying the inside of the Beatles album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|151}}}} The cover art was provided by [[Cal Schenkel]] whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|88}}

Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&amp;nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} A theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is heard during one song.

During the late 1960s, Zappa continued to develop the business sides of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the [[Bizarre Records]] and [[Straight Records]] labels, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], as ventures to aid the funding of projects and to increase creative control. Zappa produced the double album ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' for [[Captain Beefheart]], and releases by [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Persuasions]], [[Wild Man Fischer]], and [[the GTOs]], as well as [[Lenny Bruce]]'s last live performance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|173–175}}

In 1967 and 1968, Zappa made two appearances with [[the Monkees]]. The first appearance was on an episode of [[The Monkees (TV series)|their TV series]], "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where Zappa, dressed up as [[Michael Nesmith|Mike Nesmith]], interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as Zappa. After the interview, Zappa destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "Mother People" plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie [[Head (film)|''Head'']] where, leading a cow, he tells [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] "the youth of America depends on you to show them the way." Zappa had respect for what the Monkees were doing, and offered [[Micky Dolenz]] a position in the Mothers. RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not allow Dolenz out of his contract.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|158–59}}

In the Mothers' second European tour in September/October 1968 they performed for the {{ill|Internationale Essener Songtage|de}} at the [[Grugahalle]] in [[Essen]], Germany; at the [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]] in Copenhagen, Denmark; for TV programs in Germany (''[[Beat-Club]]''), France, and England; at the [[Concertgebouw]] in Amsterdam; at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London; and at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zappateers.com/fzshows/6669.html September–October 1968: The 2nd European tour], zappateers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in mid-1968, and the Zappas moved into a house on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, only to move again to one on Woodrow Wilson Drive.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|178}} This was Zappa's home for the rest of his life. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially.&lt;ref name="walley116"&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his "electrical chamber music".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|119–120}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}}
[[File:Frank 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zappa with the Mothers of Invention, [[Boulevard de Clichy|Theatre de Clichy]], Paris, 1971]]
In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing [[royalties]] whether they played or not.&lt;ref name="walley116"/&gt; 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for [[Warner Bros. Records]]' [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.

In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|107}} but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|120}} Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}} Others were irritated by 'his [[Autocracy|autocratic]] ways',&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|116}} Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' and ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'' (both released in 1970).

After he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22632|pure_url=yes}}|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Hot Rats. Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}} It features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, "[[Peaches en Regalia]]", which reappeared several times on future recordings.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}} He was backed by jazz, blues and R&amp;B session players including violinist [[Don "Sugarcane" Harris]], drummers [[John Guerin]] and [[Paul Humphrey]], multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the Mothers of Invention [[Ian Underwood]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Shuggie Otis]] on bass, along with a guest appearance by [[Captain Beefheart]] (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, "Willie the Pimp"). It became a popular album in England,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} and had a major influence on the development of the [[jazz-rock fusion]] genre.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}}

==1970s==

===Rebirth of the Mothers and filmmaking===
[[File:FRANK ZAPPA3.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Zappa in Paris, early 1970s]]
In 1970 Zappa met conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. They arranged a May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie ''[[200 Motels]]''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|142–56}}

Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[the Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie", or "[[Flo &amp; Eddie]]".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|201}}

This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|205}} which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie ''200 Motels'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]. Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|207}} It was the first feature film photographed on [[videotape]] and transferred to [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]], a process that allowed for novel visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;Starks, 1982, ''Cocaine Fiends and Reefer Madness'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It was released to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|94}} The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|119–37}}

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East – June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band from L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances—which used songs to build sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|203–04}}{{refn|group=nb|During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track "Scumbag" and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called "Au"), which Zappa renamed "A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono.}}

===Accident, attack and aftermath===
[[File:Frank Zappa Mothers of Invention 1971.JPG|right|thumb|Zappa with the Mothers, 1971]]

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_WakaJawaka.ogg|description=The closing track on ''Waka/Jawaka'', one of Zappa's jazz-oriented albums.|title="Waka/Jawaka" (1971)|pos=right}}
On December 4, 1971, Zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation. After losing $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1971|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, audience member Trevor Howell pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}}

This attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "[[Dancin' Fool]]"), resulting in chronic back pain.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

During 1971–72 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|101}} Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats,'' in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} Zappa began touring again in late 1972.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&amp;nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top 10 album: ''Apostrophe ({{'}})''===
Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created [[DiscReet Records]], also distributed by Warner Bros.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|231}} Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album ''[[Apostrophe (')]]'' (1974), which reached a career-high No.&amp;nbsp;10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] pop album charts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}} | title= Frank Zappa &gt; Charts and Awards &gt; Billboard Albums | work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by the No.&amp;nbsp;86 chart hit "[[Don't Eat the Yellow Snow Suite|Don't Eat The Yellow Snow]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53148|pure_url=yes}} | title= Apostrophe (').

===Business breakups and touring===
[[File:Frank Zappa - Capt. Beefheart - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa with [[Captain Beefheart]], seated left, during a 1975 concert]]
Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|250}} Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' (1976) directly to [[Warner Bros.]], thereby bypassing DiscReet.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|253, 258–59}}

In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for ''[[Läther]]'' (pronounced "leather"), a four-LP project. ''Läther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|131}} Zappa managed to get an agreement with [[Phonogram Inc.]], and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Zappa responded by appearing on the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], allowing them to broadcast ''Läther'' and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|248}} A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the ''Läther'' material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|267}}{{refn|group=nb|When the music was first released on CD in 1991, Zappa chose to rerelease the four existing albums. ''Läther'' was released posthumously in 1996. It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Phonogram.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} In the liner notes to the 1996 release, Gail Zappa states that "As originally conceived by Frank, ''Läther'' was always a 4-record box set."}}

Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts,&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined. Among other musicians were bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]], singer-guitarist [[Ray White]] and keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]]. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|262}} Zappa's song "[[I'm the Slime]]" was performed with a voice-over by ''SNL'' booth announcer [[Don Pardo]], who also introduced "Peaches En Regalia" on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member [[John Belushi]] during the instrumental piece "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his Samurai Futaba character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Zappa, Frank, 1978, ''Zappa in New York'', Liner Notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's band at the time, with the additions of Ruth Underwood and a horn section (featuring [[Michael Brecker|Michael]] and [[Randy Brecker]]), performed during Christmas in New York, recordings of which appear on one of the albums Warner Bros. culled from the ''Läther'' project, ''[[Zappa in New York]]'' (1978).

''Zappa in New York'' featured a song about sex criminal [[Michael H. Kenyon]], "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song.

The double album ''Sheik Yerbouti'' was the first release on [[Zappa Records]], and contained the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single "Dancin' Fool", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;45 on the ''Billboard'' charts,&lt;ref name="BBsingles"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}}|title=Frank Zappa&gt; Charts &amp; Awards&gt; Billboard Singles|work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Jewish Princess (song)|Jewish Princess]]", which received attention when a Jewish group, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged [[anti-Semitic]] lyrics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|234}} Zappa vehemently denied any anti-Semitic sentiments, and dismissed the ADL as a "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their idea of a good time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=He's Only 38 and He Knows How to Nasty|last=Peterson|first=Chris|journal=Relix Magazine|date=November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's commercial success was attributable in part to "[[Bobby Brown (song)|Bobby Brown]]". Due to its explicit lyrics about a young man's encounter with a "dyke by the name of Freddie", the song did not get airplay in the U.S., but it topped the charts in several European countries where English is not the primary language.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|351}} The triple LP ''Joe's Garage'' featured lead singer [[Ike Willis]] as the voice of the character "Joe" in a [[rock opera]] about the danger of [[political system]]s,&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|140}} the suppression of [[freedom of speech]] and music—inspired in part by the [[Islamic revolution]] that had made music illegal within its jurisdiction at the time&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|277}}—and about the "strange relationship Americans have with sex and sexual frankness".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|140}} The album contains rock songs like "Catholic Girls" (a [[riposte]] to the controversies of "Jewish Princess"),&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|59}} "Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up", and the title track, as well as extended live-recorded guitar improvisations combined with a studio backup band dominated by drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] (with whom Zappa had a particularly good musical rapport)&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|180}} adopting the [[xenochrony]] process.

On December 21, 1979, Zappa's movie ''[[Baby Snakes]]'' premiered in New York. The movie's tagline was "A movie about people who do stuff that is not normal".&lt;ref&gt;Baby Snakes, 2003, ''DVD cover'', Eagle Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2&amp;nbsp;hour and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist [[Tommy Mars]] and percussionist [[Ed Mann]] (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist [[Adrian Belew]]. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of [[clay animation]] by [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]] who had earlier provided animation sequences to Zappa for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'').&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|}}282 The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/article_501.shtml|title=Baby Snakes|format= DVD|last=Sohmer|first=Adam|date=June 8, 2005|publisher=Big Picture Big Sound |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|282}}

After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released ''[[Tinsel Town Rebellion]]'' in 1981. It was the first release on his own [[Barking Pumpkin Records]],&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of ''[[sprechstimme]]'' (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]]).&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|284}} the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and "The Blue Light" have been described as a "hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|165}} The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist [[Steve Vai]], who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|283}}

The same year the double album ''[[You Are What You Is]]'' was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen]] (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house,&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt; thereby giving him complete freedom in his work.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|269}} The album included one complex instrumental, "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53163|pure_url=yes}}|title=You Are What You Is. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dumb All Over" is a tirade on religion, as is "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against [[Televangelism|TV evangelists]] such as [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]] for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}} Songs like "Society Pages" and "I'm a Beautiful Guy" show Zappa's dismay with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] era and its "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}}
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_SYNPYG.ogg|description=The title track on ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'' features Zappa's guitar improvisations.|title=Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More|pos=left}}
In 1981, Zappa also released three instrumental albums, ''[[Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar]]'', ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More'', and ''The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'', which were initially sold via mail order, but later released through the [[CBS]] label due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Absolutely Frank.

==="Valley Girl" and classical performances===
In May 1982, Zappa released ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]'', which featured his biggest selling single ever, the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated song "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]" (topping out at No.&amp;nbsp;32 on the ''Billboard'' charts).&lt;ref name="BBsingles"/&gt; In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon Unit]] satirized the patois of teenage girls from the [[San Fernando Valley]], which popularized many "[[Valspeak]]" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon", "fer sure, fer sure", "grody to the max", and "barf out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2677879|pure_url=yes}}|title="Valley Girl" --song review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, two different projects were released, beginning with ''[[The Man from Utopia]],'' a rock-oriented work. The album is eclectic, featuring the vocal-led "Dangerous Kitchen" and "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats", both continuations of the sprechstimme excursions on ''Tinseltown Rebellion.'' The second album, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. I]]'', contained orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). A second record of these sessions, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. II]]'' was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "Valley Girl".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}} Zappa was not satisfied with the LSO recordings. One reason is "Strictly Genteel", which was recorded after the trumpet section had been out for drinks on a break: the track took 40 edits to hide out-of-tune notes.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}}

Conductor Nagano, who was pleased with the experience, noted that "in fairness to the orchestra, the music is humanly very, very difficult".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|315}} Some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of Zappa's orchestral work so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53172|pure_url=yes}}|title=London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1.

Although critically acclaimed the work was a financial failure, and only performed twice.

===Synclavier===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_NavalAviation.ogg|description=A Zappa composition for classical ensemble from ''Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger''|title=Naval Aviation in Art?|pos=right}}
For the remainder of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the [[Synclavier]] as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize anything he could dream up.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages&amp;nbsp;... with ''one-millisecond'' accuracy—every time".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|319}} Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–173}}

In 1984, he released four albums. ''[[Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger]]'' contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist [[Pierre Boulez]] (who was listed as an influence on ''Freak Out!''), and performed by his [[Ensemble InterContemporain]]. These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|73}} The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].

The album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a Broadway play dealing with a [[dystopia]]n "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the AIDS virus, and a [[eugenics]] program conducted by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;The musical was eventually produced for the stage in 2003.

===Digital medium and last tour===
Around 1986, Zappa undertook a comprehensive re-release program of his earlier vinyl recordings.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|340}} He personally oversaw the remastering of all his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s albums for the new digital compact disc medium.{{refn|group=nb|For a comprehensive comparison of vinyl of CD releases, see {{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/|title=The Frank Zappa Album Versions Guide&amp;nbsp;– Index|series=The Zappa Patio|publisher=lukpac.org/~handmade/patio|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}}} Certain aspects of these re-issues were criticized by some fans as being unfaithful to the original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;For example, new drum and bass parts were used on the 1960s albums ''We're Only in It for the Money'' and ''Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets''. See Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly twenty years before the advent of online music stores, Zappa had proposed to replace "phonographic record merchandising" of music by "direct digital-to-digital transfer" through phone or cable TV (with royalty payments and consumer billing automatically built into the accompanying software).&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}} In 1989, Zappa considered his idea a "miserable flop".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}}

The album ''[[Jazz from Hell]],'' released in 1986, earned Zappa his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1988 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. Except for one live guitar solo ("St. Etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the Synclavier. Although an [[instrumental]] album, containing no lyrics, Meyer Music Markets sold ''Jazz from Hell'' featuring an "explicit lyrics" sticker—a warning label introduced by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in an agreement with the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|year=2001|title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-16772-1|pages=39, 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|346–50}} The tour was documented on the albums ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]'' (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); ''[[The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life]]'' (Zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Stairway to Heaven]]''); and ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]''. Parts are also found on ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore'', volumes [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4|4]] and [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 6|6]]. Recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album [[Trance-Fusion]].

In 1990, Zappa was diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable.&lt;ref name="Pulse1993"/&gt; After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and [[Synclavier]] works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed ''[[Civilization Phaze III]]'', a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|374–75}}{{refn|group=nb|It brought him a posthumous [[Grammy Award]] (with Gail Zappa) for [[Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package|Best Recording Package&amp;nbsp;– Boxed]] in 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search|title=Grammy Winners|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}}}

In 1991, Zappa was chosen to be one of four featured composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were [[John Cage]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[Alexander Knaifel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Menn| editor-first=Don|contribution=Andreas Mölich-Zebhauser—Preparing the Ensemble Modern for the Frankfurt Festival|title=Zappa!

Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also performed in 1991 in [[Prague]], claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Adieu_CA.html |title=Pražský Výběr—Adieu CA |website=Globalia.net |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UFtHqDrJ-fA|Frank Zappa Last Performance (Prague 1991)}} at 3:50&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1992, the concerts went ahead as scheduled but Zappa could only appear at two in Frankfurt due to illness. At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "[[G-Spot Tornado]]" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor [[Peter Rundel]]). Zappa received a 20-minute ovation.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer [[Louise Lecavalier]]. It was his last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} Recordings from the concerts appeared on ''[[The Yellow Shark]]'' (1993), Zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous ''[[Everything Is Healing Nicely]]'' (1999).

===Death===
Zappa died, after his long battle with prostate cancer, on December 4, 1993, 17 days before his 53rd birthday at his home with his wife and children by his side. At a private ceremony the following day, his body was buried in a grave at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], in Los Angeles. The grave is unmarked.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|552}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|379–80}} On December 6, his family publicly announced that "Composer Frank Zappa left for his final tour just before 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|320}}

===Influences===
Zappa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]]; 1950s blues artists [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Johnny Guitar Watson]], and [[B.B. King]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Guitar_Player.htm|title=Frank Zappa On&amp;nbsp;...

His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]].&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}}{{refn|group=nb|Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs "Flower Punk" (which parodies the song "[[Hey Joe]]") and "Who Needs the Peace Corps?", which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music|edition=illustrated|first1=Virgil|last1=Moorefield |publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51405-7|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ0R4_Oxr-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.&lt;ref name="quotes"/&gt;

===Project/Object===
Zappa's albums make extensive use of [[segue]]d tracks, breaklessly joining the elements of his albums.&lt;ref name="segue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Father of Invention |first1=John |last1=Corcelli |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61713-673-3 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209 Extract of page 290]&lt;/ref&gt; His total output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; He also called it a "conceptual continuity", meaning that any project or album was part of a larger project.

===Techniques===

====Guitar playing====

Zappa is widely recognized as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of ''Guitar World'', Jon Swenson declared: "the fact of the matter is that [Zappa] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/frank-zappa-talks-gear-praises-steve-vai-his-first-guitar-world-interview-1982 |title=Frank Zappa Talks Gear, Praises Steve Vai in His First Guitar World Interview from 1982 |publisher=Guitar World |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of ''Guitar Player'' magazine wrote: "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth [[legato]] technique, while Zappa's right was "one of the fastest pick hands in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artist-lessons/1026/frank-zappa-shut-up-n-learn-his-guitar-techniques--tab--audio/56754 |title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Learn His Guitar Techniques &amp;#124; TAB + AUDIO |publisher=GuitarPlayer |date=2016-11-23 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His song "Outside Now" from ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' poked fun at the negative reception of Zappa's guitar technique by those more commercially minded, as the song's narrator lives in a world where music is outlawed and he imagines "imaginary guitar notes that would irritate/An executive kind of guy", lyrics that are followed by one of Zappa's characteristically quirky solos in 11/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Franรงois Couture |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/outside-now-mt0006332790 |title="Outside Now" – Frank Zappa &amp;#124; Song Info |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa transcriptionist Kasper Sloots wrote, "Zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (Zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right in front of an audience without knowing what the outcome will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa-analysis.com/shuttxt.htm |title=Shut up 'n play yer guitar |website=Zappa-analysis.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English guitarist and bandleader [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] opined that Zappa was "very interesting as a human being and a very interesting composer" and that he "was a very good musician but he was a dictator in his band," and that he "was taking very long guitar solos -- 10-15 minute guitar solos and really he should have taken two or three minute guitar solos, because they were a little bit boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hit-channel.com/interview-john-mclaughlin-solo-mahavishnu-orchestra-miles-davis/151278 | title=Interview: John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis) • Hit Channel| date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tape manipulation====
In New York, Zappa increasingly used [[audio engineer|tape editing]] as a compositional tool.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|160}} A prime example is found on the double album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, '' Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; where the track "King Kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts,{{refn|group=nb|In the process, he built up a vast archive of live recordings. In the late 1980s some of these recordings were collected for the 12-CD set ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore''.}} and because of his insistence on precise [[Out of tune|tuning]] and timing, he was able to augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Mix2003"&gt;
{{cite web|title=We are The Mothers&amp;nbsp;... and This Is What We Sound Like!|last=Michie|first=Chris|publisher=MixOnline.com|date=January 2003|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308055438/http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the [[tempo]] or [[Meter (music)|meter]] of the sources. He dubbed this process "[[xenochrony]]" (strange synchronizations&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marshall, "Interview with Frank Zappa", October 22, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;)—reflecting the Greek "xeno" (alien or strange) and "chronos" (time).&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Following Zappa's death, his widow Gail created the Zappa Family Trust, which owns the rights to Zappa's music and other creative output: more than 60 albums were released during Zappa's lifetime and 40 posthumously.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-ca-ms-frank-zappa-legacy/|title=It's brother and sister against brother and sister in bitter fight over control of Frank Zappa's legacy|last=Randall Roberts|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Gail's death in October 2015, Zappa's youngest children, Ahmet and Diva, were given control of the trust with shares of 30% each, while his older children, Moon and Dweezil, were given smaller shares of 20% each.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-the-zappa-family-feud-w431684|title=Inside the Zappa Family Feud|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and politics==

===Drugs===
Zappa stated that he tried smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] approximately ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin or any of that other stuff".&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"/&gt; Zappa stated, "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |title=Interview by Bob Marshall, October 22, 1988 – Part 03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223085837/http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |archivedate=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a heavy [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoker]] for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.{{refn|group=nb|He considered such campaigns as [[yuppie]] inventions and noted that "Some people like garlic.&amp;nbsp;... I like pepper, tobacco and coffee. That's my [[metabolism]]".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|234–35}}}}

While he disapproved of drug use, he criticized the [[War on Drugs]], comparing it to [[alcohol prohibition]], and stated that the [[United States Treasury]] would benefit from the decriminalization and regulation of drugs.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|329}} Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, "I believe that people have a right to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. In a democracy, you own the government—it doesn't own you."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24, 329–30}}

===Government and religion===
[[File:Praga 7 zappa havel.jpg|left|thumb|Zappa with [[Václav Havel]], 1990]]

===Anti-censorship===

Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on [[CNN|CNN's]] ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' TV series and debated issues with ''Washington Times'' commentator [[John Lofton]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="CNN TV Debate"/&gt; On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the [[United States Senate]] Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]], wife of then-senator [[Al Gore]]. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 2000, ''Censorship'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the "Blank Tape Tax." Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://urbigenous.net/library/zappa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|267}} and called their proposal for voluntary [[Parental Advisory|labelling of records]] with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|262}}

In his prepared statement, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating [[dandruff]] by [[decapitation]].&amp;nbsp;... The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain Christians do not like. What if the next bunch of Washington wives demands a [[Yellow badge|large yellow "J"]] on all material written or performed by Jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed Zionist doctrine?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/p51.html|title=Record Labeling.

Zappa set excerpts from the PMRC hearings to Synclavier music in his composition "Porn Wars" on the 1985 album ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'', and the full recording was released in 2010 as ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]'' Zappa is heard interacting with Senators [[Fritz Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=lowe194&gt;{{cite book |title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa |first1=Kelly | last1=Fisher Lowe |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8032-6005-4 |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA194 Extract of page 194]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Frank Zappa in popular culture}}

Zappa had a controversial critical standing during his lifetime. As [[Geoffrey Himes]] noted in 1993 after the artist's death, Zappa was hailed as a genius by conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and nominated by Czechoslovakian President [[Vaclav Havel]] to the country's cultural ambassadorship, but he was in his lifetime rejected twice for admission into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and been found by critics to lack emotional depth. In ''[[Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] dismissed Zappa's music as "sexist adolescent drivel ... with meters and voicings and key changes that are as hard to play as they are easy to forget."&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=December 12, 1993|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1993/12/12/pop-recordings/2e1e34bf-05aa-438b-b2c7-20f8e640600d/|title=Pop Recordings|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Himes:

{{quote|"Admirers and detractors agree that Zappa's music -- with its odd time signatures, unorthodox harmonies and fiendishly difficult lines -- boasts a rare cerebral complexity. But that's where the agreement ends. Some fans find his sophomoric jokes ("Don't Eat the Yellow Snow") and pop music parodies ("Sheik Yerbouti") a crucial counterbalance to the rarefied density of the music; other devotees find the jokes an irrelevant sideshow to music best appreciated in a chamber or orchestral setting. The critics find the humor's smug iconoclasm a symptom of the essential emptiness of Zappa's intellectual exercises."&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;}}

===Acclaim and honors===
{{quote box|quote=Frank Zappa was one of the first to try tearing down the barriers between rock, jazz, and classical music. In the late Sixties his Mothers of Invention would slip from Stravinsky's "Petroushka" into The Dovells' "Bristol Stomp" before breaking down into saxophone squeals inspired by Albert Ayler|source= — ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll''&lt;!-- found on p. 497 --&gt;|width=365px}}

''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004) writes: "Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Brackett|editor-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition|year=2004|place=New York, New York|publisher=Fireside|page=903|isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression.

In 1971, biographer David Walley noted that "The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite".&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, [[Barry Miles]] noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|383}}
[[File:Zappa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frank Zappa in 1977]]
''[[Guitar Player]]'' devoted a special issue to Zappa in 1992, and asked on the cover "Is FZ America's Best Kept Musical Secret?" Editor Don Menn remarked that the issue was about "The most important composer to come out of modern popular music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Don|last=Menn|editor-last=Menn|editor-first=Don|contribution=From the Editor|title=Zappa!

Conductor [[Kent Nagano]] remarked in the same issue that "Frank is a genius. That's a word I don't use often&amp;nbsp;... In Frank's case it is not too strong&amp;nbsp;...

There, it was written that "Frank Zappa was rock and roll's sharpest musical mind and most astute social critic. He was the most prolific composer of his age, and he bridged genres—rock, jazz, classical, avant-garde and even novelty music—with masterful ease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/frank-zappa|title=Frank Zappa|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards|title=Lifetime achievement award|publisher=grammy.org|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked number 36 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; in 2000.

Scientists from various fields have honored Zappa by naming new discoveries after him. In 1967, paleontologist Leo P. Plas, Jr. identified an extinct [[mollusc]] in Nevada and named it ''Amaurotoma zappa'' with the motivation that, "The specific name, ''zappa'', honors Frank Zappa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plas, Jr.|first=Leo P.|title=Mollusca from the Arrow Canyon Range, Clark County, Nevada|date=March 1972|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=46|pages=249–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, biologist Ed Murdy named a [[genus]] of [[gobiidae|gobiid]] fishes of New Guinea ''Zappa'', with a [[species]] named ''Zappa confluentus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murdy|first=E.O.|title=A Taxonomic Revision and Cladistic Analysis of the Oxudercine Gobies (Gobiidae: Oxudercinae)|publisher=Records of the Australian Museum|year=1989|isbn=978-0-7305-6374-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist Ferdinando Boero named a Californian [[jellyfish]] ''Phialella zappai'' (1987), noting that he had "pleasure in naming this species after the modern music composer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boero|first=Ferdinando|title=Life cycles of Phialella zappai n. sp., Phialella fragilis and Phialella sp.

Belgian biologists Bosmans and Bosselaers discovered in the early 1980s a Cameroonese spider, which they in 1994 named ''[[Pachygnatha zappa]]'' because "the ventral side of the abdomen of the female of this species strikingly resembles the artist's legendary moustache".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Robert|last2=Bosselaers|first2=Jan|title=Spiders of the genera ''Pachygnatha'', ''Dyschiriognatha'' and ''Glenognatha'' (Araneae, Tetragnathidae), with a revision of the Afrotropical species|date=October 1995|journal=Zoologica Scripta|volume=23|pages=325–52|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.1994.tb00392.x|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gene of the bacterium ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'' that causes urinary tract infections was in 1995 named ''zapA'' by three biologists from Maryland.

In the late 1990s, American paleontologists Marc Salak and Halard L. Lescinsky discovered a [[animal|metazoan]] fossil, and named it ''Spygori zappania'' to honor "the late Frank Zappa&amp;nbsp;... whose mission paralleled that of the earliest paleontologists: to challenge conventional and traditional beliefs when such beliefs lacked roots in logic and reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spygoria zappania New Genus and Species, a Cloudina-like Biohermal Metazoan from the Lower Cambrian of Central Nevada|last=Salak|first=Marc|last2=Lescinsky|first2=Halard L.|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=73|issue=4|date=July 1999|pages=571–76|doi=10.1017/s002233600003239x|bibcode=1974JPal...48..524M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, lobbying efforts initiated by psychiatrist John Scialli led the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] to name an [[asteroid]] in Zappa's honor: [[3834 Zappafrank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seachrist|first=Lisa|title=Space Rock Gets Zappa'd|journal=Science|volume=265|issue=5174|date=August 12, 1994|page=871|doi=10.1126/science.265.5174.871-c |pmid=17782133|bibcode=1994Sci...265..871.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid was discovered in 1980 by Czechoslovakian astronomer [[Ladislav Brožek]], and the citation for its naming says that "Zappa was an eclectic, self-trained artist and composer&amp;nbsp;...

In 1995, a bust of Zappa by sculptor Konstantinas Bogdanas was installed in [[Vilnius]], the Lithuanian capital (54.683, 25.2759). The choice of Zappa was explained as "a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom."&lt;ref name="Pompilio"/&gt; A replica was offered to the city of Baltimore in 2008, and on September 19, 2010 — the twenty-fifth anniversary of Zappa's testimony to the U.S. Senate — a ceremony dedicating the replica was held, and the bust was unveiled at a library in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/entertainment/bs-ae-zappa-cover-0917-20100916_1_gail-zappa-southeast-anchor-library-lithuania|title=Zappa comes home|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/news/bs-ae-zappa-rail-0917-2-20100916_1_southeast-anchor-library-zappa-plays-zappa-zappa-related|title=Zappa-looza: A full guide to the weekend's events|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Froissage''' is a method of [[collage]] developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artist [[Ladislav Novák (artist)|Ladislav Novák]] in which the lines made by crumpling up a piece of paper are used to create a drawing. One major exponent of the art of froissage is [[Jiří Kolář]].

In his lifetime, Kolář acquired a reputation as one of the most inventive 20th-century [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artists. A member of [[Group 42]] and the first Czech Group of Experimental Poetry, he assisted in the development of the collage techniques of '''froissage''' and '''confrontage'''. During that time, writing poems and crumpling up pieces of paper were considered subversive activities and were discouraged by the then-powerful [[Communism|Communist]] regime. Kolář endured harassment and imprisonment, and eventually emigrated to [[France]], where he was finally able to attain international renown for his work. 

Froissage is a unique art in which the contours of a crumpled piece of paper are used to create a drawing. Currently on display in a small gallery at the [[French Institute]], Kolář’s froissages incorporate previously existing 17th-century French drawings to form more modern, abstract pictures. The results occasionally can be likened to early [[Cubism|Cubist]] efforts to capture multiple motions and images within a single frame.

'''GPS Drawing,''' also known as '''GPS Art''' and '''Strava Art''', is a method of [[drawing]] where an uses a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device and follows a pre planned route to create a large-scale picture or text on a map.  Artists usually run or cycle the route though cars, vans, and aeroplanes are used to create larger pieces. 

==Planning==
GPS artists can spend many hours finding a certain image or text hidden in a map or can sometimes simply see an existing image in a map due to [[Pareidolia]].  In many cities and towns the road layout and landscape restricts the routes available so artisst have to find creative ways to show their pictures or characters.  In cities where there is a strong grid pattern an 8-bit style or [[pixelated]] images can be created of almost any object or shape.  Many artists will create paper or digital maps of their route to follow on their journey.

== Artistic Style ==
There are many approaches to GPS Drawing which an artist can choose depending or their means of travel and the landscape around them.

==== Roads, Trails, and Paths Only ====
This style uses only pre existing roads, paths, trails, etc. which can make it more challenging to find a route and plan the artwork.  On the other hand following these paths makes navigation during the journey much easier and the artwork is more likely to reflect the original plan.  This is how the majority of GPS artworks are made.

==== Freehand on Open Ground or in Open Air ====
Freehand GPS drawing is where artist creates a shape on open ground without following existing paths which means the artist has to watch their progress in real time on their GPS device.  Artists can run or cycle over open ground such as parks, fields, and car parks.  Artists in cars and other motor vehicles can draw shapes on large open areas such as deserts, airfields, and beaches.  Almost all artworks created by aircraft and watercraft use this technique as they are not restricted by human and [[physical geography]].  Freehand GPS drawing opens unlimited possibilities but without [[Waypoint|waypoints]] and existing routes it is very easy to loose track of your progress and make mistakes.

==== Pausing the GPS Device ====
By pausing the GPS device and restarting it at different locations an artist is able to draw straight lines across the map though the built environment and over physical barriers.  Though this can create very striking images and open up new possibilities in a city most artists do not use technique.

==== Adding Extra Images ====
Some artists add extra images or lines to the map after they have created the route.  They can do this to simply add [[googly eyes]] to an animal or face or go further add lines and other features which help viewers see what they have drawn.  Other times an artist will show a photo or other image alongside their drawing if it is not clear at first glance what has been drawn.

== Display ==
Most people use a route mapping app or other service to display their drawing online and to share on social media.  Popular apps include Strava, Map My Run, and Garmin.  Many artists also import their route into [[Google Maps]], [[OpenStreetMap|Open Streetmap]], Viweranger, and other map services before capturing the image to display and share.  This gives the artist the option of expanding and cropping the image, orienting it another way, or tilting the map to add perspective.  Some artists use [[False color|false color maps]] then choose contrasting colors for their route to create vivid images.

==Examples and Artists==
The idea was first implemented by artists Hugh Pryor and [[Jeremy Wood]], whose work includes a 13-mile wide fish in [[Oxfordshire]], spiders with legs 21 miles long in [[Port Meadow, Oxford]],&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; and "the world's biggest 'IF'": a pair of letters, "I", which goes from [[Iffley]] in [[Oxford]] to [[Southampton]] and back, and "F" which traverses through the Ifield Road in [[London]] down to [[Iford, East Sussex]], through [[Iford]] and back up through [[Ifold]] in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; The total length is 537&amp;nbsp;km, and the height of the drawing in [[typographic unit]]s is 319,334,400 [[point (typography)|point]]s.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|title=2003: The 3rd Annual Year in Ideas; GPS Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-gps-art.html|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical computer fonts at standard resolutions are between 8 and 12 points.

In early 2014 programmer Joe Rosen released a GPS-A-Sketch GPS sketching app for iOS, through the iTunes App Store.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 2016, musicians [[Shaun Buswell]] &amp; Erik Nyberg travelled around the [[United Kingdom]] drawing a 400+ mile penis across [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theocelot.co.uk/two-musicians-have-drawn-a-giant-wedding-tackle-during-their-uk-tour-using-gps-tracking/|title=Two musicians have drawn a giant “wedding tackle” during their UK tour using GPS tracking|publisher=The Ocelot|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 artist Nathan Rae created a #WeLoveManchester piece as part of the cememorations of the [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena Bombing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/strava-map-manchester-heart-runner-14694321|title=The runner who made a 67-mile Strava heart all around Manchester|last=Johnson|first=Helen|date=2018-05-23|work=men|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific GPS artists is the artist known as [https://www.instagram.com/wallygpx/ WalleyGPX] who, as of October 2018, has created over 500 pieces of GPS art.  He uses pencil and paper to plan the routes around his home city of [[Baltimore]] which he then creates by bicycle.

'''Gaur''' ('today' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) was a Basque artistic group founded in 1966 by [[Amable Arias]], [[Rafael Ruiz Balerdi]], [[Nestor Basterretxea]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Remigio Mendiburu]], [[Jorge Oteiza]], [[José Antonio Sistiaga]], and [[José Luis Zumeta]].&lt;ref name="Bilbao"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/amable-balerdi-basterretxea-chillida-mendiburu-oteiza-sistiaga-zumeta-243|title=Amable, Balerdi, Basterretxea, Chillida, Mendiburu, Oteiza, Sistiaga, Zumeta|publisher=Bilbao Fine Arts Museum|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-guard group, based in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain, provided the springboard for a wide [[History of the Basques|Basque]] artistic movement with close links to influential social, cultural and political agents in the Basque Country opposed to Franco's dictatorship during the 70s and early 80s. 

The group launched with an exhibition on 28 April 1966 at the Barandiarán Gallery in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss2016.eu/en/news/item/2630-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-gaur-group-the-barandiaran-gallery-and-the-contemporary-art-in-the-exhibition-1966-gaur-konstelazioak-2016|title=The 50th anniversary of the Gaur Group, the Barandiaran Gallery and the contemporary art in the exhibition 1966 {{!}} Gaur Konstelazioak {{!}} 2016|work=dss2016.eu|publisher=San Sebastian 2016 – Donostia 2016|date=22 January 2016|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/1/eduardo-chillida/obra/grupo-gaur|title=Grupo Gaur|trans-title=Gaur Group|publisher=Artium|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged the aesthetic moulds and artistic conventions prevailing during that period in Gipuzkoa, and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] altogether. The artists founding the movement stirred at the rapid economic and social changes taking place at the moment, the virtually non-existent cultural scene, and the crisis of the Basque collective identity.

It stood out as the most prolific artistic group in a constellation of groups founded across all the Basque Country during the same period that made up the Basque Art School.

'''Gradation''' in art is a visual technique of gradually transitioning from one colour hue to another, or from one shade to another, or one texture to another.  Space, distance, atmosphere, volume, and curved or rounded forms are some of the visual effects created with gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gradation.svg|thumb|A gradient illustration, showing a gradation spectrum from black to white.]]
Artists use a variety of methods to create gradation, depending upon the art medium, and the precise desired effect. [[Blending (art)|Blending]], [[shading (art)|shading]], [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]] are common methods.  A fading effect can be created with [[pastels]] by using a [[torchon (art)|torchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gradation in photography==
Gradation can also be useful in composing photographs. The early decades of the development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: {{blockquote|The great defect of all the processes of photolithography described in the last section is that they can only be applied with advantage to the reproduction of drawings or subjects in which the gradation of shade is shown by lines or dots separated by white spaces of varying sizes and at varying intervals apart, as in line or stipple engravings and lithographs in line and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British Journal of Photography|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1878|volume=XXV|pages=518|author=J. Waterhouse, Capt.|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[File:Halftone example CMYK.png|thumb|Example of a halftone reproduction of a photograph.]]
A major innovation was the development of [[halftone]] photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a [[Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT)]], with a [[halftone screen]] as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.

Analog photography is limited by the materials and equipment used by the photographer to capture gradation. These constraints are eliminated in digital photography, where software can be used to manipulate photograph images to create gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Lambrecht |author2=Ralph W.

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

==Concept==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

The '''Incoherents''' (''Les Arts incohérents'') was a short-lived French art movement founded by Parisian writer and publisher [[:fr:Jules Lévy|Jules Lévy]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; (1857-1935) in 1882, which in its satirical irreverence anticipated many of the art techniques and attitudes later associated with [[avant-garde]] and [[anti-art]].  

Lévy coined the phrase ''les arts incohérents'' as a play on the common expression ''les arts décoratifs'' (i.e. arts &amp; crafts, but above all, a famous art school in Paris, the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|National School of Decorative Arts]]). The Incoherents presented work which was deliberately irrational and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]], contained [[found objects]], was [[nonsense|nonsensical]], included humoristic sketchs, drawings of children, and drawings "made by people who don't know how to draw."  Lévy exhibited an all-black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] called ''Combat de Nègres dans un Tunnel'' (Negroes Fight in a Tunnel).  The early film animator [[Émile Cohl]] contributed photographs which would later be called [[surrealism|surreal]].  

[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Joconde smoking pipe'' by Sapeck, in ''[[Le Rire]]'', 1887.]] 

Although small and short-lived, the Incoherents were certainly well-known.  The movement sprang from the same [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture that spawned the [[Hydropathes]]  of [[Émile Goudeau]] and [[Alfred Jarry]]'s ''[[Ubu Roi]]''.  The October 1882 show was attended by two thousand people, including [[Manet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Richard Wagner]].  Beginning in 1883 there were annual shows, or masked balls, or both.  In an 1883 show, the artist [[:fr:Eugène Bataille (Sapeck)|Sapeck (Eugène Bataille)]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; contributed ''Le rire,'' an "augmented" ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' smoking a pipe, that directly prefigures the famous [[Marcel Duchamp]] 1919 "appropriation" of the ''Mona Lisa'', ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]''.    

The movement wound down in the mid-1890s.

==History==
The Incoherent arts were born in the late nineteenth century, a period that was rich in scientific discoveries and social innovations. Cheeky and inventive, this time also marks a turning point in the field of art. The official art traditions were even being questioned in the newspapers through satirical images which implied it was a dying craft. It was in this creative lull that Jules Levy - former member of the literary club [[Hydropathes]] - decided to organize "an exhibition of drawings made by people who can not draw." This charitable carnival helped victims of a recent gas explosion to have an opportunity to present their works. The first "Incoherent arts" get-together, which took place on July 13, 1882 on the Champs Elysées hosts many curiosities. Taking advantage of a power outage, and lit only by candlelight, they created a jumble of rebellious works, using all types of materials and any inspiration with the ultimate goal of making people laugh. 

On October 2, 1882, Jules Lévy decided to repeat the experience at home. He gathered his friends under the pretense of having an "unusual evening". In his tiny apartment they worked under the phrase "Death to clichés, to us young people!" They received unexpected success and lots of newspaper coverage. As a result, the Incohérents arts movement became engrained into the Parisian cultural landscape. In October 1883 the Paris had its first official exhibition of Incoherent art, ran by local Galerie Vivienne. The purpose was charitable as with all Incoherent exhibits thereafter. A regulation 13-point proclamation was that "All the works are allowed, the serious works and obscene excepted". The exhibition adopts a true catalog, including a piece by Levy Orville in which he reverses an inkwell for the sake of aesthetics. The tone of the exhibition was set by an abundance of parodies and pictorial puns. More than 20,000 visitors took part over a month. 

A year later, the Incoherents returned to haunt the Galerie Vivienne with their cheeky pranks. They hoped this occasion would see the image of the "Chief pipes Poyle sand without number, on a silver field," an ancient statue carving chisel of an academician who does not lead wide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A catalog accompanied the exhibition with luxury engraved reproductions of most of the significant works. On its cover, a dancer brandishes a broom and scares away the gloom of black birds. The journalists accompanied the event with enthusiasm. The artists were increasingly familiarizing themselves with the pictorial map and the pun, both of which helped to establish this kind of "Incoherent" art. In 1886 the Incoherents at the Eden Theatre unveiled their new exhibit. Jules Chéret's poster included Levy going through the moon like a paper hoop. At the entrance, the rules regarding the event were framed prominently: "One goal you propose, laugh and cheer you frankly." The room was also full of visitors that worked in high, medium or low relief. Everything was recorded in catalog records which are decorated with "striking" portraits of exhibitors and zany references. 

In 1886 Jules Levy began to be the target of criticism. He was accused of using the Incoherent Arts for its own interests. He had in fact opened a publishing house in 1886 and published the works of his friends (Goudeau, Leroy, Monselet, etc..), illustrated by artists such as Boutet, Somm or Gray. He gradually lost the support of the French Courrier who had declared him as "the official unofficial Incoherent" in 1884. Meanwhile, some seeking to take advantage of the Incoherent movement by opening Incoherent cafes or established magazine operations, that the founders of the movement had nothing to do with. In 1887 Jules Levy promised the end of Inconsistency would be on April 16 of that year. A costume party was organized for the occasion with a [[Folies Bergère]] funeral procession. However, Incoherence has a brief renaissance on March 27, 1889 at a new dance held at the Eden Theatre. Levy wanted this event to remind the good memories of the Incoherent arts and to announce the return of his exhibitions. But in the spring of the 1889 exhibition he organized, while the Expo was in full swing in Paris, it was a fiasco. The press hardly covered the event, and even the [[French Courier]] remained silent. The Incoherent arts was no longer a novelty interest. Jules Levy, refusing to give up, created the magazine ''Folies Bergère'' in January 1891. Poorly organized, not repeated, the show is considered too long and the ball too short.
The last gasp of the inconsistency, his exhibition of 1893 had a brand new premise at Olympia, and passed almost unnoticed. Jules Blois of the French Mail wrote: "All that is outdated, outmoded. Inconsistency joined decadence, decay and other jokes with or without handles in the bag of old fashioned chiffes" Despite that, Levy still pulled on the Incoherent string until 1896 when it was met with massive indifference from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsincoherents.info%2F | title=History of the Incoherent arts | publisher=Les Arts incohérents | accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cover of ''On Kitsch'' by Odd Nerdrum and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch" /&gt;|alt=Image shows man on a spherical object hunched over.]]
'''Kitsch painting''' is an international movement of [[Classical tradition|classical painters]] founded upon a 24 September 1998 speech and philosophy by the Norwegian artist, [[Odd Nerdrum]],&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Pettinger [http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-kitsch-campaign/Content?oid=926148] "The Kitsch Campaign" [Boise Weekly], December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; later clarified in his book ''[[On Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dag Solhjell and Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Kitsch-Jan-Erik-Ebbestad-Hansen/dp/8248901238] "On Kitsch" Kagge Publishing, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jan-Ove Tuv and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch"&gt;Odd Nerdrum, Sindre Mekjan, Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, Jan-Ove Tuv, and Dag Solhjell&lt;/ref&gt; The movement incorporates the techniques of the [[Old Masters]] with narrative, [[romanticism]], and emotionally charged imagery. The movement defines [[Kitsch]] as synonymous with the [[art]]s of ancient Rome or the [[techne]] of ancient Greece. Kitsch painters embrace kitsch as a positive term not in opposition to "[[art]]", but as its own independent superstructure. Kitsch painters assert that Kitsch is not an art movement, but a philosophical movement separate from [[art]]. The Kitsch movement has been considered an indirect criticism of the contemporary art world, but according to Nerdrum and many Kitsch painters, this is not their expressed intention.&lt;ref&gt;Signy Norendal, "Interview with Robert Dale Williams" [Aktuell Kunst] September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scott [http://artbabel.blogspot.com/2010/04/philosophy-of-kitsch-kant-kunst-and.html] The Philosophy of Kitsch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://janovetuv.com/bruker/articles/Defence%20of%20kich_E%2038-39.pdf Jan-Ove Tuv]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of kitsch painting philosophy==
The philosophy originated by Nerdrum first manifested into a group among Nerdrum's circle of students&lt;ref&gt;Kristiane Larssen "Skolemesteren" [D2/DagensNaeringsliv] November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Ove Tuv, Helene Knoop, Hege Elizabeth Haugen, Monika Helgesen, [[Jeremy Caniglia]], Kjetil Jul, Brad Silverstein, Carlos Madrid, Stefan Boulter, Brandon Kralik, Nanne Nyander, and soon expanded.

A '''limner''' is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator of manuscripts]], or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration. One of the earliest mentions of a limner's work is found in the book ''Methods and Materials of Painting'' by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] (1793–1865).

{{quote|"The treatises [on oil painting] cannot be placed later than the thirteenth, or beginning of the fourteenth, century. This was the age of [[Dante]], and "the art which in Paris was called illuminating" (limning) is well illustrated by such guides." p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake. ''Methods and Materials of Painting''. Mineola, NY: [[Dover Publications]], 2001. {{ISBN|978-0486417264}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==United Kingdom==
In London in the mid-19th century the limner [[David Laurent de Lara]] established himself as a modern illuminator of manuscripts and documents.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubinstein |editor1-first=William L.|editor2-last=Jolles|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Rubinstein |editor3-first=Hilary |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History |isbn=9780230318946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spOxzrifZjcC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Laurent de Lara, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work broke new ground and helped establish the idea of illumination as a contemporary artform in its own right, rather than as a historical artform.&lt;ref name=rowan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Rowan|editor1-last=Coomans D|editor1-first=Thomas|editor2-last=De Maeyer|editor2-first=Jan|title=The revival of medieval illumination : nineteenth-century Belgium manuscripts and illuminations from a european perspective = Renaissance de l'enluminure médiévale : manuscripts et enluminures belges du XIXe siècle et leur contexte européen |date=2007 |publisher=KADOC |location=Leuven |isbn=9789058675910 |pages=88–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VsLdTWjlnoC&amp;pg=PA88|chapter=Publishing for the Leisure Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Her Majesty's [[Painter and Limner]] is a position within the [[Great Officer of State|Royal Household]] unique to Scotland. It is currently held by Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Birthdays Today 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The position of portrait painter to the royal household is honorary and for life.

==United States==
In early 19th-century America, a limner artist was one who had little if any formal training and would travel from place to place to solicit commissions.

Among colonial America's rising mercantile class, a limner was an unattributed [[portrait]] commissioned as a status symbol. The local landowners and merchants who commissioned these portraits posed in their finest clothes, in well-appointed interiors, or in landscapes that identified their position, property, good taste, and sophistication.

A late named artist who began in this genre is the [[Maine]] landscape artist [[Charles Codman]], who in Eastern Argus (April 1, 1831) is described as an "ornamental and sign painter" or "limner" who practiced "Military, Standard, Fancy, Ornamental, Masonic and Sign Painting".&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, Jessica. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa654.htm "'The Real Pioneer of Art in this City': Charles Codman and the Rise of Landscape Painting in Portland, Maine". ''Resource Library Magazine'', July 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822120601/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa654.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Victoria Limners Society was a group of artists working in Victoria, British Columbia from 1971 through 2008. They worked within a variety of artistic styles and mediums, such as painting, sculpting, pottery, and other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Bovey, Patricia. ''A Passion for Art: The Art and Dynamics of the Limners''. Victoria, B.C.: Sono Nis Press, 1996. {{ISBN|9781550390704}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists include Maxwell Bates, Pat Martin Bates, Richard Ciccimarra, Robert De Castro, Colin Graham, Helga Grove, Jan Grove, [[Elza Mayhew]], [[Myfanwy Pavelic]], Carole Sabiston, [[Herbert Siebner]], [[Robin Skelton]], and Karl Spreitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorybc.ca/limners-group-of-artists;isaar "Limners (Group of artists)"] MemoryBC&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to find [[minced oath]]s in literature and media. Writers often include minced oaths instead of [[profanity]] in their writing so that they do not offend audiences or incur [[censorship]].

==Novels==

[[W. Somerset Maugham]] referred to this problem in his 1919 novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', where he admitted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle.&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maugham |first=W. Somerset |authorlink=W. Somerset Maugham |title=The Moon and Sixpence|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|year=1919|chapter=chapter 47 |isbn=978-0-486-44602-8|oclc=22207227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |title=Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-631-16593-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, authors of children's fiction sometimes put minced oaths into the mouths of characters who swear a lot, as a way of depicting a part of their behaviour that would be unconvincing not to represent, but also avoiding the use of swear words which would be considered unsuitable for children to read.

In 1851, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bark's parts of speech are of an awful sort—principally adjectives. I won't, says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises! I won't, by adjective and substantive! ...

The term ''dickens'' itself, probably from the surname, became a minced oath when referring to the devil.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

Mystery writer Fran Rizer deploys "kindergarten cussin'" in her [[Callie Parrish]] series, where the main character can be heard muttering, "[[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]!" and "[[Shih Tzu]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rizer |first=Fran |title=Casket Case |publisher=Berkley Penguin |year=2008|series=Callie Parrish |volume=3 |isbn=978-0-425-22428-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' series, characters use oaths such as "flaming" or "blood and ashes" or the interjection "light" in the same strength as a curse word, without having to print swear words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staveley |first1=Brian |title=OF LUMMOXES AND DICKHEADS: CURSING IN FANTASY |url=https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/cursinginfantas/ |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Fiction writer [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in novels such as ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' and ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'', uses '[[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]' and '[[Pudendal cleft|slit]]' to refer to male and female body parts (and sometimes males and females) respectively.

The lead characters of [[Anthony Crowley]] (a demon) and [[Aziraphale]] (an angel) from ''[[Good Omens]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], both use minced oaths on a number of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2006 novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'', the main characters, Lisey and Scott Landon, use the word ''smuck'' instead of ''fuck'', replacing it wherever ''fuck'' would be conceivably used: ''smucking, mothersmucker, smucked up'', etc.

In the ''[[Gaunt's Ghosts]]'' series by [[Dan Abnett]], the Imperial Guardsmen use the word ''feth'' as a general all-purpose swear word, primarily to replace the word ''fuck''.

In the series ''TZA'', John Spencer uses ''spash'' in place of most curses from the second book forth.

Throughout his comic novel ''[[Myron]]'', [[Gore Vidal]] replaces various obscenities with the names of judges who were involved in an obscenity trial.

In the ''[[Codex Alera]]'' series, by Jim Butcher, most obscenities are replaced with a variation of the word crow, e.g. crows or crowbegotten.

[[Terry Pratchett]] uses minced oaths for comic effect, for example in [[Mort]]: ''"A wizard. I hate ----ing wizards." "Well, you shouldn't ---- them then," replied the second, effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes.''  In a later book, [[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]], the character [[Discworld characters#Mr Tulip|Mr Tulip]] habitually and persistently uses a similarly diagetic form of pseudo-profane interjection throughout his dialogue.

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', the character 'Big Jim' Rennie avoids swearing by replacing words such as ''fucking and clusterfuck'' with ''cottonpicking and clustermug''.

Ernest Hemingway substituted muck for that with which it rhymes in 'Across the River and into the Trees ' and fornicate for that with which it doesn't rhyme in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' It makes for some awkward constructions in the latter.

[[Spider Robinson]], in his science fiction novels, consistently uses "kark" in place of "fuck", and "taken slot" in place of "fucking slut" -- "slot" perhaps being also a reference to the female anatomy as receptacle.

[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]] features the minced oaths of "mouse-dung" and rarely "fox-dung," and others relevant to the forest are used in place of curses.

==Comic books==
In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic strip featured in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', the futuristic justice department approved the terms ''Stomm'', ''Drokk'', and ''Grud''. This last is a clear reference to the Christian God as it is accompanied by the apparatus of an organized religion, including "Church of Grud" and similar. Use of the terms includes the colorful "Grud on a Greenie!".&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/node/497833 |title=Swear words from science fiction |last=Saunders |first=Suzanne (Segnbora-t)|date=2000-04-15 |work=[[Everything2]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, ''2000 AD'' also featured a ''[[Dan Dare#2000 AD|Dan Dare]]'' comic strip, loosely set in the same continuity as ''Judge Dredd'', and these strips too used such parlance as ''Stomm'' and ''Drokk''.

In comic series ''[[Johnny the Homicidal Maniac]]'', the characters sometimes use the word ''fook'' in place of ''fuck''.

The DC Comics character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term ''bastich'' or ''bastiches'' as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. "Take that you lousy bastiches!"

[[Captain Haddock]], from ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', swears unlike a real sailor with sesquipedalian ejaculations like "billions of blistering blue barnacles" and "thundering typhoons".&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9734 |title=Billions of Blistering Blue Barnicles! |last=Lopresti |first=Rob |date=2009-11-11 |work=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2009-11-13 |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

In the [[Al Pacino]] epic ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', the title character [[Tony Montana]], played by Pacino, is warned by his Colombian accomplice in the censored version of the film, "Don't fool with me, Tony", and "I warned you not to fool with me, you foolish little monkey". Otherwise, the film, especially in its uncensored version, is filled with use of the word 'fuck', and the censored TV version replaces these in their dozens with 'fool'.

''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', in the film of the same name, which is rated PG, uses minced oaths to a particularly comical effect.

In the 1945 [[war film]] ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'', the screenplay substitutes "loving" for "fucking" (the universal American soldier's descriptor).

In ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the character Ralphie is punished by his parents for saying "Oh, fuck," although the offensive word is replaced with "fudge" in the film.  The narrator, an adult version of Ralphie (voiced by [[Jean Shepherd]]), explains that "I didn't say fudge.  I said THE word...the queen mother of dirty words: the F-dash-dash-dash word."

In the 1984 film ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'', the character Roman Maronie is known for butchering the English language, especially English vulgarities:
:* You ''fargin' '' sneaky ''bastages''! (You fucking sneaky bastards!)
:* Don't ''bullshtein'' me! (Don't bullshit me!)
:* You lousy ''corksuckers''. (You lousy cocksuckers.)
:* Dirty ''summina-batches''. (Dirty sons-of-bitches.)
:* I'm gonna shove 'em up your ''icehole''. (I'm gonna shove 'em up your asshole.)

One of the more infamous TV edits is that of John McClane's iconic line from ''[[Die Hard]]'', "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker" is changed to "Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon".

The TV edit of the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', instead of having the police lineup say, "Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker", they say "Give me the keys, you fairy godmother".

In the 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', a well-known television edit exists of one profane-heavy scene altered. "See what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass" is changed to "See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps" and "this is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs".

A television edit of the film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' contains the injunction "Flip you, melon farmer!" (Fuck you, motherfucker!)

A censored version of the 2004 film [[Shaun of the Dead]] contains a scene where "fuck" and "prick" are changed to "funk" and "prink", respectively. This leads to an exchange of minced oaths beginning, "it's four in the funking morning!" and ending with "it's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prink".

In Disney's 2016 animated film ''[[Zootopia]]'', Officer Judy Hopps uses the minced oath "Oh sweet cheese and crackers".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The televised version of the 2006 film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' received the following edits to two of Samuel L. Jackson's lines: The line "I've had with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane" was changed to "I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane", and a later use of "fucking" is replaced with "freaking".

==Drama==

Late [[Elizabethan]] drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to [[Puritan]] opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'sblood&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's blood'' from [[Shakespeare]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slight&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''God's light'' from [[Ben Jonson]], and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'snails&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's nails'' from the historian John Hayward.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford |year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-0-19-861186-8|url=http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swearing on stage was officially banned by the [[Act to Restrain Abuses of Players|Act to Restraine Abuses of Players]] in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.

In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'struth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (''By God's truth'') came to be spelled ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'strewth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''zounds'' changed pronunciation so that it no longer sounded like ''By God's wounds''.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|103–105}} Other examples from this period include ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slid&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for "By God's eyelid" (1598) and ''sfoot'' for "By God's foot" (1602). ''Gadzooks'' for "by God's hooks" (the [[nail (relic)|nails]] on [[Christian cross|Christ's cross]]) followed in the 1650s, ''egad'' for ''oh God'' in the late 17th century,&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|date=August 2006|edition=4|isbn=978-0-618-70172-8|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Charlton Grant|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary |editors=Guralnik, David, Agnes |publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons|location=Cleveland|date=April 2004|edition=4|isbn=978-0-7645-7125-1|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ods bodikins'' for "by God's little body" in 1709.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is similar to the use popularized in the 1950s of ''gee whiz'' as an oath for ''Jesus' wisdom''.&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD" /&gt;

In modern times, the gang members in the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'' talk in an invented 1950s-style slang that includes several minced oaths. At the end of the "Jet Song," they sing "We're gonna beat / Every last buggin' gang / On the whole buggin' street / On the whole ever-mother-lovin' street!" where ''buggin'' and ''mother-lovin'' are obvious minced oaths.

==Television==

"Freaking" (or sometimes "fricking") is often employed on U.S. over-the-air television entertainment programming as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my freaking food?" It is rarely used to replace "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse.

In the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[The Old Grey Whistle Theft]]", Ted's picnic at the local picnic area is disturbed by people claiming that he is in their "fupping spot". The man yells out "Fup off, ya grasshole" and when Ted asks them why they are talking like that, the man points to a list of picnic area rules, one of which is "No Swearing". The man finishes by yelling out "Fup off, ya pedrophile." In every single episode of ''Father Ted'' no Irish character utters the word "fuck", apart from one scene in "Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep" where the phrase "fucking hell" is shouted twice; although its attenuated alternative "[[feck]]" is heard repeatedly throughout.

In both incarnations of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', characters use the word "frack" ([[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]]) or "frak" ([[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]]) in place of "fuck" in every sense of the word, as an interjection, as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my fracking food?" as well as "fuck" or "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse. Characters in the original series also use "felgercarb" in place of "shit". Characters on ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' then adopted "frak" from ''Battlestar Galactica''.

In the TV series ''[[Farscape]]'' the characters use the word "frell" as a combination of "frig", "fuck", and "hell" (as in "What the frell is going on?"), and the word "dren" instead of "shit". "Hezmana" and "yotz" are also used as rough replacements for "hell" and "crap" respectively.

In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', characters often use the word "gorram" in place of "goddam" or "god damned." Further, the word "fuck" and its variants is replaced variously by "hump", "humped" or "rutting". For example, "I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump," "If they find us at all, we're humped." and "It's the chain I go get and beat you with 'til you understand who's in ruttin' command here." Additionally, the characters do much of their cursing in Mandarin Chinese. This keeps the show unobjectionable enough to air on network television, yet at the same time maintain a realistic level of profanity for a show about outlaws, inspired by the wild west.

Likewise, in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', characters use a series of minced oaths regularly. Two such are used moderately, "Gimboid" and "goit" are derivations of "gimp" and "git" respectively (although "git" is frequently used also), but the final is a series trademark, "smeg". Although it is said to have derived from "smegma", the show's writers have said it is just a coincidence, as its similarity to the label of an Italian white-goods manufacturer. In any case, it has evolved into a word almost entirely specific to the Red Dwarf universe and numerous alterations were used in the show, such as: "smeg-head", "smeg-for-brains", "smegging", etc.

In ''[[South Park]]'' the word "[[fudge]]" (instead of "fuck") is frequently used, especially in the episode ''[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]'', where [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] sells chocolate fudge delicacies called "Fudge 'Ems", "Fudge This", "Go Fudge Yourself", "I Don't Give a Flying Fudge" and "I Just Went and Fudged Your Momma". "Lover" and "loving" are used in place of "fuck" through the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "Chickenlover". This is explained in the episode to be for the purpose of protecting young news viewers.

The television series ''[[A Bit of Fry and Laurie]]'' contains a sketch in which Fry and Laurie employ minced oaths; it is situated in a courthouse, and Laurie plays a policeman reciting the words of an offender. Examples include, "I apprehended the accused and advised him of his rights. He replied "Why don't you ram it up your pim-hole, you fusking cloff prunker."" and "Skank off, you cloffing cuck, you're all a load of shote-bag fuskers, so prunk that up your prime-ministering pim-hole." The sketch ends with Fry asking of Laurie's response to this language, and Laurie proclaiming, "I told him to mind his fucking language, m'lud."

In the Nickelodeon children's show ''[[iCarly]]'', characters often use the term "chizz" as a general purpose expletive, most often used in place of 'shit'.&amp;nbsp; ''iCarly'' is notorious for its thinly veiled adult humor.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, in the spinoff ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'', the term "wazz" is used in place of 'piss'.

Characters in the series ''[[The Good Place]]'' find themselves in an afterlife where they are incapable of using profanity. When they intend to curse, the word instead comes out as a benign minced oath such as "fork" for "fuck", "shirt" for "shit", or "bench" for "bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Erik |title=The rules of The Good Place were meant to be broken |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-rules-of-the-good-place-were-meant-to-be-broken-1822250773 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbing of movies for television often replaces "Fuck you!" with "Forget you!", "bastard" with "buzzard", "fucking" with "stinking", and "prick" with "pig".

==Music==

[[The Fugs]], a mid-1960s band named by [[Tuli Kupferberg]], used a euphemism for "fuck" found in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ([[#Novels|above]]), ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="NM" /&gt;

==Internet==

In a discussion of profanity, writer Leigh Lundin uses the glyph [[ƒ]].&lt;ref name="CB0329"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=5931|title=WTF|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-03-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further discusses being "nannied" by Internet software, noting that words like cockatoo, pussycat, and even Hummer may be flagged,&lt;ref name="CB0729"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=137|title=Bad Words |chapter=Petting |last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2007-07-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become known as the [[Scunthorpe problem]].

In that vein, [[ProBoards]] forums replace the word "cock" with "thingy", thereby transforming the statement "cock his shotgun" into "thingy his shotgun". Similarly, the [[Something Awful forums]], filters replace "fuck" with the phrase "gently caress" and "shit" with "poo-poo" for unregistered users, and the Fark website replaces words such as "fuck" with "fark".&lt;ref name="fark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/|title=Fark|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, [[leet|alternative typographical glyphs]] are sometimes used to evade [[profanity filter]]s (such as $hit or $#!+ instead of [[shit]], @$$ or @rse instead of [[Buttocks|ass]] or [[Buttocks|arse]]).

"fsck", from "[[fsck|'''f'''ile'''s'''ystem '''c'''hec'''k''']]", is commonly used on Usenet and in other technology-related circles to replace "fuck".

{{Mythology}}
'''Myth''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in society, such as foundational tales.  The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = oflaherty&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger O'Flaherty|first = Wendy|quote =I think it can be well argued as a matter of principle that, just as 'biography is about chaps', so mythology is about gods.|page = 19|title = Hindu Myths|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7TFlN5hmsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date =1975|publisher = Penguin|isbn = 9780140443066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and are closely linked to [[religion]] or spirituality.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|p= 102}} [[Creation myth]]s particularly, take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p= 1}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} Other myths explain how a society's [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established and sanctified.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

The study of myth began in [[ancient history]]. Rival classes of the [[Greek myths]] by [[Euhemerus]], [[Plato]] and [[Sallustius]] were developed by the [[Neoplatonists]] and later revived by [[Renaissance]] mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including [[folklore studies]], [[philology]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''mythology''' may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as [[comparative mythology]].

===''Myth''===
Definitions of ''myth'' to some extent vary by scholar. Finnish [[folklore studies|folklorist]] Lauri Honko offers a widely cited definition:
{{quote|Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the [[cosmogony|beginning of the world]], the [[creation myth|creation]], fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains. A myth expresses and confirms society's religious values and norms, it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated, testifies to the efficacy of [[ritual]] with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of [[cult]].&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"&gt;{{cite book|last =Honko|first = Lauri|date = 1984 |chapter =The Problem of Defining Myth|editorlink=Alan Dundes|editor-first = Alan|editor-last = Dundes|title =Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth|page = 49|publisher = [[University of California Press]]|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars in other fields use the term ''myth'' in varied ways.{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p=147}}{{sfn|Doty|2004|pp= 11–12}}{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 5}} In a broad sense, the word can refer to any [[traditional story]],{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p=57}}{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p= 74}}{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|p= 3}} [[popular misconception]] or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary|chapter=myth|page=770|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as [[legend]] and [[Folklore genre|folktale]] in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.&lt;ref name="SALAMON-GOLDBERG-2012"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsdhM9tI3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1 =Salamon|first1=  Hagar |first2= Harvey E.|last2= Goldberg|date = 2012|chapter =Myth-Ritual-Symbol|editor1-first= Regina F.|editor1-last= Bendix |editor2-first= Galit|editor2-last= Hasan-Rokem |title = A Companion to Folklore|page = 125|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 7}} Some kinds of folktales, such as [[fairy stories]], are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9, 17}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 10–11}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|pp= 99–101}} Main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans,{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oflaherty" /&gt; while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|pp=22, 32}}{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p= 55}} Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]] and [[faerie]]s.&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Doty|2004|p=114}}{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 13}} Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the [[Matter of Britain]] (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on [[King Arthur]] and [[Round Table|the knights of the Round Table]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/romance-literature-and-performance#toc50951|title=romance {{!}} literature and performance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Matter of France]], seem distantly to originate in historical events of the fifth and eighth-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries.

In colloquial use, the word ''myth'' can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.&lt;ref&gt;"myth, n., §2" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670. Accessed 23 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage, which is often [[pejorative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howells|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Titanic|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34BdSTbnSKUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=myth+pejorative&amp;source=web&amp;ots=X4AT1P_6XR&amp;sig=3UkHYLBt7fQrRDjP4ZOOtQzbBfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose from labeling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, pp. 23, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as commonly used by [[folklore studies|folklorists]] and academics in other relevant fields, such as [[anthropology]], the term ''myth'' has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Winzeler, Robert L. (2012) ''Anthropology and Religion: What We Know, Think, and Question'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term ''myth'' is widely used to imply that a story is not [[objective truth|objectively true]], the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as [[truth|true]] and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]], and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as being the province of [[theology]] rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in [[Hinduism]], as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of [[Christianity]]. Labelling all religious narratives as ''myths'' can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In present use, ''mythology'' usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people, but may also mean the study of such myths.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p=8}} For example, [[Greek mythology]], [[Roman mythology]] and [[Hittite mythology]] all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures. Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] defines myth as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form. Dundes classified a sacred narrative as "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; Anthropologist [[Bruce Lincoln]] defines ''myth'' as "ideology in narrative form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lincoln |first= Bruce |year= 2006 |title= An Early Moment in the Discourse of "Terrorism": Reflections on a Tale from Marco Polo |jstor= 3879351 |journal= [[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |volume= 48 |issue= 2 |pages= 242–259 |quote= More precisely, mythic discourse deals in master categories that have multiple referents: levels of the cosmos, terrestrial geographies, plant and animal species, logical categories, and the like.

===''Mythography''===
The compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as ''mythography'', a term which can also be used of a scholarly anthology of myths (or, confusingly, of the study of myths generally).&lt;ref&gt;"mythography, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124691. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Key mythographers in the Classical tradition include [[Ovid]] (43 BCE–17/18 CE), whose tellings of myths have been profoundingly influential; [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]], a Latin writer of the late fifth to early sixth centuries, whose ''Mythologies'' (Latin: ''Mitologiarum libri III'') gathered and gave moralistic interpretations of a wide range of myths; the anonymous medieval [[Vatican Mythographers]], who developed anthologies of Classical myths that remained influential to the end of the Middle Ages; and the Renaissance scholar [[Natalis Comes]], whose ten-book ''Mythologiae'' became a standard source for classical mythology in later Renaissance Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', 2 vols (Gainesville, 1994–2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent mythographies include the thirteenth-century ''[[Prose Edda]]'' attributed to the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], which is the main surviving survey of [[Norse Mythology]] from the Middle Ages.

===''Mythos''===
Because ''myth'' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense, some scholars have opted to use the term ''mythos'' instead.&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic?

==Origins of the terms ''myth'' and ''mythology''==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|''Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song'', by Francesco Hayez, 1813–15]]
The word ''myth'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''μῦθος'' [''mȳthos''], meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early nineteenth century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for 'a traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'.&lt;ref name =mythmythos&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670 myth, n.]", "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124705 mythos, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|μυθολογία}} [''mythología''] ("story," "lore," "legends," "the telling of stories") combines the word ''mȳthos'' with the suffix -''λογία'' [''-logia''] ("study"), and meant 'romance, fiction, story-telling'.&lt;ref name="oedlogy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "-logy, ''comb. form''". Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Plato]] used ''mythología'' as a general term for "fiction" or "story-telling" of any kind.

The Greek term ''mythología'' was then borrowed into [[Latin language|Latin]]. [[Late Latin]] ''mythologia'', which occurs in the title of Latin author [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]' fifth-century ''Mythologiæ'', denoted the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, which we now call [[classical mythology]]. Fulgentius's ''Mythologiæ'' explicitly treated its subject matter as [[allegory|allegories]] requiring interpretation and not as true events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fabius Planciades |last=Fulgentius|title=Fulgentius the Mythographer|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=73mJIuYfmzEC}}|year=1971|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0162-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term was then adopted in [[Middle French]] as ''mythologie''. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word "mythology" in the fifteenth century, at first in the sense 'the exposition of a myth or myths; the interpretation of fables; a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Troy Book]]'' of c. 1425.&lt;ref name=oedmlogy&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed.

''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, ''mythology'' was used to mean a [[moral]], [[fable]], [[allegory]] or a [[parable]], or collection of traditional stories,&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;{{refn|All which [''sc.''

It came eventually to be applied to similar bodies of [[traditional stories]] among other [[polytheism|polytheistic]] cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;

===Meanings in Ancient Greece===
The term μῦθος (''mythos'') appears in the works of [[Homer]] and other poets of Homer's era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson (2004), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation, narrative, speech, story, tale, and word.

Like the related term λόγος (''[[logos]]''), ''mythos'' expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words; these can be contrasted with  ἔργον (''ergon''), a Greek term for action, deed, and work.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In the context of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the term ''mythos'' referred to the myth, the narrative, the plot, and the story of a play.&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (2000), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Wiles, the Greek term ''mythos'' in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

According to philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' was also used for the source material of [[Greek tragedy]]. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from [[Greek mythology]], a body of "traditional storylines" which concerned [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the ''mythos'' behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when [[Theatrical adaptation|adapting them for the stage]]. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; Storytellers like [[Euripides]] (c. 480–406 BCE) relied on [[suspense]] to excite their audiences. In one of his works, [[Merope (Messenia)|Merope]] attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit [[filicide]] or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

David Wiles points that the traditional ''mythos'' of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its [[oral tradition]]. The [[Greeks]] of this era were a literate culture, but produced no [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"&gt;Wiles (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BCE), mothers and [[nursemaid]]s narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

[[Bruce Lincoln]] has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms ''mythos'' and ''logos'' in the works of [[Hesiod]]. In ''[[Theogony]]'', Hesiod attributes to the [[Muse]]s the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (falsehoods which seem like real things).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln (1999), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is ''legein'', which is etymologically associated with ''logos''. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses ''gerusasthai'', the other ''mythesasthai''. The latter is a form of the verb ''mytheomai'' (to speak, to tell), which is etymologically associated with ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In the ''[[Works and Days]]'', Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is ''mythesaimen'', another form of ''mytheomai''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the "speech of ''mythos''" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the [[truth]]. While he associated the "speech of ''logos''" with telling [[lie]]s, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term ''logoi'' (the plural form of ''logos'') elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term "[[seduction|seductive]]" and three times with the term "falsehoods".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists ''logoi'' among the children of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

==Interpreting myths==

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main article|Comparative mythology}}
Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common "protomythology" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture.{{sfn|Littleton|1973|p=32}}

===Functionalism===
A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 8}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}} and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine.{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 19}}

[[Lauri Honko|Honko]] asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present.&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.{{sfn|Barthes|1972}}

[[Devdutt Pattanaik|Pattanaik]] defines mythology as "a subjective truth of people that is communicated through stories, symbols and rituals". He adds, "unlike fantasy that is nobody’s truth, and history that seeks to be everybody’s truth, mythology is somebody’s truth."&lt;ref name="PD2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-i-insist-on-calling-myself-a-mythologist|title=Why I Insist On Calling Myself A Mythologist|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|date=14 September 2015|website=Swarajya|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euhemerism===
{{Main article|Euhemerism}}
{{See also|Herodotus}}
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} For example, the myth of the wind-god [[Aeolus]] may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}} [[Herodotus]] (fifth-century BCE) and [[Prodicus]] made claims of this kind.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} This theory is named ''[[euhemerism]]'' after mythologist [[Euhemerus]] (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}}&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemerism", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: [[Apollo]] represents the sun, [[Poseidon]] represents water, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: [[Athena]] represents wise judgment, [[Aphrodite]] desire, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} [[Max Müller|Müller]] supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as "raging" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}}

===Personification===
{{See also|Mythopoeic thought}}
Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 195}} For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 4}} Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 15}}

===Myth-ritual theory===
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 61}} In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.{{sfn|Graf|1996|p= 40}} This claim was first put forward by [[William Robertson Smith|Smith]],{{sfn|Meletinsky|2014| pp=19–20}} who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 63}} [[James Frazer|Frazer]] claimed that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

==History of the academic discipline==
Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the Soviet school, and the [[Myth and Ritual School]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801987593).jpg|thumb|right|''Myths and legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]
The critical interpretation of myth began with the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratics]].{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events – distorted over many retellings. Sallustius&lt;ref&gt;On the Gods and the World, ch. 5, See Collected Writings on the Gods and the World, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; divided myths into five categories – theological, physical (or concerning natural laws), animistic (or concerning soul), material, and mixed. Mixed concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations.

Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As [[Platonism]] developed in the phases commonly called [[Middle Platonism]] and [[neoplatonism]], writers such as [[Plutarch]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]], [[Olympiodorus the younger|Olympiodorus,]] and [[Damascius]] wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus’ ''Commentary on the Republic'' (to be found in ''The Works of Plato I'', trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry’s analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (''Select Works of Porphyry'', Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with [[Homer]]. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths ([[Cupid and Psyche]]). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. ''Euhemerism'', as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of [[Paganism|pagan]] mythology following [[Christianization]]).

===European Renaissance===
[[File:Bartolomeo di Giovanni - The Myth of Io - Walters 37421.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The ancient Roman poet Ovid, in his "The Metamorphoses," told the story of the nymph Io who was seduced by Jupiter, the king of the gods. When his wife Juno became jealous, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer to protect her. This panel relates the second half of the story. In the upper left, Jupiter emerges from clouds to order Mercury to rescue Io. In the lower left, Mercury guides his herd to the spot where Io is guarded by the hundred-eyed Argus. In the upper center, Mercury, disguised as a shepherd, lulls Argus to sleep and beheads him. Juno then takes Argus's eyes to ornament the tail feathers of her peacock and sends the Furies to pursue Io, who flees to the Nile River. At last, Jupiter prevails on his wife to cease tormenting the nymph, who, upon resuming her natural form, escapes to the forest and ultimately becomes the Egyptian goddess Isis|This panel by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] relates the second half of the [[Metamorphoses]].

Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the [[Renaissance]], with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the ''[[Theologia mythologica|Theologia Mythologica]]'' (1532).

===Nineteenth century===
The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the nineteenth century{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} — at the same time as the word ''myth'' was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages.&lt;ref name="mythmythos" /&gt; They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and [[vernacular]] culture, associated with [[Romantic Nationalism]] and epitomised by the research of [[Jacob Grimm]] (1785–1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with [[Norse mythology]], [[Finnish mythology]], and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through [[colonialism]]. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and current oral narratives such as [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] or stories told in [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref name = shippey&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1–28 (esp. pp. 4–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about [[evolution]]. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages—and therefore, conceivably, stories—were all descended from a lost common ancestor (the [[Indo-European language]]) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that [[Cultural evolution|cultures might evolve]] in ways comparable to species.&lt;ref name = shippey/&gt; In general, nineteenth-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a [[Unilineal evolution|unilineal]] framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 3–4}}

One of the dominant mythological theories of the later nineteenth century was "nature mythology", whose foremost exponents included [[Max Müller]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. This theory posited that "primitive man" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful European Victorians—for example tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism—as being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, giving rise to [[animism]]. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 4}} Müller also saw myth arising from language, even calling myth a "disease of language". He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}} Not all scholars, not even all nineteenth-century scholars, accepted this view. [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] claimed "the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind, and not a stage in its historical development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mâche|title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion| year=1992| page= 8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YNCVOY423HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first = Francois-Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for "nature mythology" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of "nature mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, 'The Eclipse of Solar Mythology', in ''Myth: A Symposium'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955), 25–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James George Frazer]] saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law: this idea was central to the "[[myth and ritual]]" school of thought.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 67–68}} According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress "from magic through religion to science."{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}}

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Prometheus by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Moreau]]. In the mythos of [[Hesiodus]] and possibly [[Aeschylus]] (the [[Greek mythos|Greek]] trilogy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and ''[[Prometheus Pyrphoros]]''), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity]]

The earlier twentieth century saw major work developing [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] approaches to interpreting myth, led by [[Sigmund Freud]], who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the [[Oedipus complex]] in his 1899 ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] likwise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called ''[[archetypes]]''. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century saw the influential development of a [[structuralist theory of mythology]], led by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 113}} Meanwhile, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as [[Origin myth|origin stories]] might provide a "mythic charter"—a legitimisation—for cultural norms and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Birenbaum, ''Myth and Mind'' (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.

In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which stood as an early work in the emerging [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wsGDVdYoRA4C&amp;dq=Barthes+Mythologies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKp_nv8q_cAhWlF5oKHSWQB6oQ6AEIJDAA|title = Mythologies|date = 1972|publisher = Hill and Wang|last = Barthes|first = Roland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century saw rapid [[secularisation]] in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as myths; theologians such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argued that a modern Christianity needed to [[Demythologization|demythologize]];&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bultmann, ''Jesus Christ and Mythology'' (New York: Scribner, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}} This, in his appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', and in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] attributed modern humans’ anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Christian theologian [[Conrad Hyers]] wrote that
{{quote|...myth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context... In a religious context, however, myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth, the most basic and important truths of all. By them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence. Myths put one in touch with sacred realities, the fundamental sources of being, power, and truth. They are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday, domestic, practical language of a people. They provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming, mysteries which, as mysteries, are hidden, yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual. Myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=107}}}}

===Twenty-first century===
Both in nineteenth-century research that tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in twentieth-century structuralist work that sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late twentieth century, however, researchers influenced by [[postmodernism]] tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. John McKinnell, ''Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism'', Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni a cura bi Teresa Pàroli, 1 (Rome, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was [[A.K. Ramanujan]]'s essay ''[[Three Hundred Ramayanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Ramanujan, ‘Three Hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation’, in ''[http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3j49n8h7/ Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia]'', ed. by Paula Richman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 22–48; [http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf reprinted] in A.K. Ramanujan, ''The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 131–60, {{ISBN|9780195668964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ken Dowden, ''The Uses of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mythology==
[[File:10,000 Belgian francs of 1929 edited.jpg|thumb|left|1929 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[banknote]], depicting [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[caduceus]]]]
In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of [[cultural studies]] research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in [[television]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/nctefiles/resources/journals/ej/1026-jul2013/ej1026exploring.pdf|title=Exploring the Boundaries of Narrative: Video Games in the English Classroom|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|date=2013|website=www2.ncte.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film|last=Singer|first=Irving|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indick|first=William|date=November 18, 2004|title=Classical Heroes in Modern Movies: Mythological Patterns of the Superhero|url=|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. [[The Walt Disney Company]] is well-known among cultural study scholars for "reinventing" traditional childhood myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television: A Necessary Critical Survey|last=Koven|first=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=176–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of [[cyberpunk]] [[action film]]s, [[fantasy]], [[drama]]s and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] tales.{{sfn|Corner|1999|pp=47–59}}

21st-century films such as ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as [[Rick Riordan]], whose [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] series is situated in a modern-day world where the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek deities]] are manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/percy-jackson-problem|title=The Percy Jackson Problem|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2014-10-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parallel universe''' is a hypothetical self-contained [[reality]] co-existing with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes are called a "[[multiverse]]", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally [[synonym]]ous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term "parallel universe" is more general, without implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very [[Physical law|laws of nature]] are different – for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion – would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality and a concept between both fantasy world and earth.

The actual [[many-worlds interpretation|quantum-mechanical]] hypothesis of parallel universes is "universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Overview==
Fantasy has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from [[mythology|myth]], [[legend]] and [[religion]]. [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]], and [[Valhalla]] are all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. [[Plato]] reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in [[Platonism]], in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly. The lower reality is similar but with flaws.

Modern [[fantasy]] often presents the concept as a series of planes of existence where the laws of nature differ, allowing [[magic in fiction|magical]] phenomena of some sort on some planes. This concept was also found in ancient [[Hindu mythology]], in texts such as the [[Puranas]], which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Similarly in [[Persian literature]], "The Adventures of Bulukiya", a tale in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=Robert|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|date=2005|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|location=London|isbn=1860649831}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} In other cases, in both fantasy and [[science fiction]], a parallel universe is a single other material reality, and its co-existence with ours is a rationale to bring a protagonist from the author's reality into the fantasy's reality, such as in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]] or even the beyond-the-reflection travel in the two main works of [[Lewis Carroll]]. Or this single other reality can invade our own, as when [[Margaret Cavendish]]'s English heroine sends submarines and "birdmen" armed with "fire stones" back through the portal from ''[[The Blazing World]]'' to Earth and wreaks havoc on England's enemies. In [[dark fantasy]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] the parallel world is often a hiding place for unpleasant things, and often the protagonist is forced to confront effects of this other world leaking into his own, as in most of the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and the ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' computer game series, or ''[[Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer 40K]]'' miniature and computer games. In such stories, the nature of this other reality is often left mysterious, known only by its effect on our own world.

The concept also arises outside the framework of quantum mechanics, as is found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]] short story ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' ("[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]"), published in 1941 before the many-worlds interpretation had been invented. In the story, a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] discovers a manuscript by a Chinese writer where the same tale is recounted in several ways, often contradictory, and then explains to his visitor (the writer's grandson) that his relative conceived time as a "garden of forking paths", where things happen in parallel in infinitely branching ways. One of the first [[Science fiction]] examples is [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'', in which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'' describes it in the manner that similar to requiring both [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] coordinates in order to mark your location on Earth, so too does time: travelling along latitude is akin to [[time travel]] moving through past, present and future, while travelling along latitude is to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities, hence the name of the short story. Thus, another common term for a parallel universe is "another dimension", stemming from the idea that if the 4th [[dimension]] is time, the 5th dimension - a direction at a right angle to the fourth - are alternate realities.

While this is a common treatment in Science fiction, it is by no means the only presentation of the idea, even in [[hard science fiction]]. Sometimes the parallel universe bears no historical relationship to any other world; instead, the laws of nature are simply different from those in our own, as in the novel ''[[Raft (novel)|Raft]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], which posits a reality where the [[gravitational constant]] is much larger than in our universe. (Note, however, that Baxter explains later in ''[[Vacuum Diagrams]]'' that the protagonists in ''Raft'' are descended from people who came from the [[Xeelee Sequence]] universe.)

One motif is that the way time flows in a parallel universe may be very different, so that a character returning to one might find the time passed very differently for those he left behind. This is found in folklore: King Herla visited Fairy and returned three centuries later; although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting, Herla and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback, this being one folkloric account of the origin of the [[Wild Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1967) p.50-1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[C. S. Lewis]] made use of this in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''; indeed, a character points out to two skeptics that there is no need for the time between the worlds to match up, but it would be very odd for the girl who claims to have visited a parallel universe to have dreamed up such a different time flow - from their perspective, the girl had only been gone for a few minutes though she was in Narnia for hours, and if she was making it up surely she would have spent a while longer hiding than a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=171|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual when dealing with stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with, especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse. Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting, and more a matter of theme and emphasis; the parts of the story the author wishes to explain and how they are explained. ''[[Narnia]]'' is clearly a fantasy, and the TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' is clearly science fiction, but works like the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series or ''[[Glory Road]]'' tend to occupy a much broader middle ground.

==Science fiction==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another "[[dimension]]" has become synonymous with the term "parallel universe". The usage is particularly common in [[movies]], television and [[comic books]] and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of ''The Flash'' #123, "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In written science fiction, "new dimension" more commonly – and more accurately – refer to additional [[Coordinate axis|coordinate axes]], beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally [[perceptible]], the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible.

[[File:Flatland cover detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin A. Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'' is set in a world of two dimensions.]]
In 1884, [[Edwin A. Abbott]] wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called ''[[Flatland|Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]]''. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

In 1895, ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] used time as an additional "dimension" in this sense, taking the [[Spacetime|four-dimensional]] model of [[classical physics]] and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like ''[[The Wonderful Visit]]'' and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', an idea proposed by the astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]], who talked about both time and parallel universes; "Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the [[TARDIS]] console in "[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]". The parallel universe was similar to the real universe but with some different aspects, Britain has a fascist government and the royal family has been executed. [[Douglas Adams]], in the last book of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', uses the idea of [[probability]] as an extra [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]]. Though, according to the novel, they're not really parallel universes at all but only a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked [[symmetry]] to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells' [[The Time Traveller (character)|"Time Traveller"]], these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment.

===Hyperspace===
{{main article|Hyperspace (science fiction)}}

Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of "hyperspace" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a [[faster-than-light]] shortcut for [[interstellar travel]]. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are:
#at least some (if not all) locations in the hyperspace universe map to locations in our universe, providing the "entry" and "exit" points for travellers.
#the travel time between two points in the hyperspace universe is much shorter than the time to travel to the analogous points in our universe. This can be because of a different speed of light, different speed at which time passes, or the analogous points in the hyperspace universe simply being much closer to each other.

Sometimes "hyperspace" is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be "crumpled" in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through, the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two-dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a "new dimension", it is not an example of a parallel universe.  It ''is'' a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See [[wormhole]].)

While use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a [[plot device]] and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction ''about'' parallel universes.

===Time travel and alternative history===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|thumb|right|British author [[H. G. Wells]]' 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'', an early example of [[time travel]] in modern fiction]]
{{Main article|Time travel|Alternate history}}

Parallel universes may be the backdrop to or the consequence of time travel, their most common use in [[Time travel in fiction|fiction]] if the concept is central to the story. A seminal example of both is in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s novel ''[[The Big Time]]'' where there's a war across time between two [[alternative future]]s manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world.

Time travelers in fiction often accidentally or deliberately create [[alternative history|alternative histories]], such as in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] where the [[Confederate Army]] is given thousands of [[AK-47]] rifles and ends up winning the [[American Civil War]]. (However, [[Ward Moore]] reversed this staple of alternative history fiction in his ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), where an alternative world where the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and the [[American Civil War]] is destroyed after a historian and time traveler from the defeated United States of that world travels back to the scene of the battle and, by inadvertently causing the death of the Confederate officer whose troops occupied [[Little Round Top]], changes the result so that the Union forces are victorious.) The alternative history novel ''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'' by [[Eric Flint]] explicitly states, albeit briefly in a prologue, that the time travelers in the novel (an entire town from [[West Virginia]]) have created a new and separate universe when they're transported into the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 17th century [[Germany]]. (This sort of thing is known as an ISOT among alternative history fans, after [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'': an ISOT is when territory or a large group of people is transported back in time to another historical period or place.){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Ordinarily, [[alternative history|alternative histories]] are not technically parallel universes. The concepts are similar but there are significant differences. Where characters travel to the past, they may cause changes in the timeline (creating a point of divergence) that result in changes to the present. The alternative present will be similar in different degrees to the original present as would be the case with a parallel universe. The main difference is that parallel universes co-exist whereas only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment.&lt;!--maybe not the best term here but i introduce 'moment' below--&gt; Another difference is that moving to a parallel universe involves some inter-dimensional travel whereas &lt;!--moving between?--&gt;alternative histories involve some type of time travel. (However, since the future is only potential and not actual, it is often conceived that more than one future may exist simultaneously.)

The concept of "sidewise" time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster's "[[Sidewise in Time]]", is often used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point. Often worlds that are similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be "closer" to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. [[H. Beam Piper]] used this concept, naming it "paratime" and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. [[Keith Laumer]] used the same concept of "sideways" time travel in his 1962 novel ''[[Worlds of the Imperium]]''. More recently, novels such as [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[The Coming of the Quantum Cats]]'' and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Anathem]]'' explore human-scale readings of the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation|"many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics]], postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows "travel" among alternative universes.

Universe 'types' frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazis won the Second World War]], as in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]], and ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in ''[[Roma Eterna]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]] and ''[[Romanitas (novel)|Romanitas]]'' by [[Sophia McDougall]]. The novel ''[[Warlords of Utopia]]'' by [[Lance Parkin]] explored a multiverse in which the universes whose Rome never fell go to war with all those whose Nazis won World War II. It fits loosely in the [[Faction Paradox]] series initiated by [[Lawrence Miles]], several of whose novels featured an artificially created universe existing within another; specifically, within a bottle. ''[[Dead Romance]]'' explored the consequences of inhabitants of the 'real' universe entering the Universe-in-a-Bottle.

In [[Philip Pullman]]'s trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', the protagonist begins in a world that is a Victorian counterpart to ours, although it takes place at the same time.&lt;!--is contemporary to ours?--&gt; It also appears that the [[Protestant Reformation]] happened differently with John Calvin becoming the last Pope.

===Counter-Earth===
The concept of [[Counter-Earth]] is typically similar to that of parallel universes but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares [[Earth's orbit]] but is on the opposite side of the Sun and, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like [[Earth]] in any way though typically in fiction; it is usually nearly identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is always within the [[universe]] (and the [[Solar System]]), travel to it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson used this concept in their 1969 movie ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (released outside Europe as ''Journey to the Far Side of the Sun''), in which a Counter-Earth is detected by astronomers and a manned mission launched by a US-European space consortium to explore it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Convergent evolution===
[[Convergent evolution]] is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories.

Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' frequently explored such worlds:

*In "[[Bread and Circuses (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Bread and Circuses]]" the ''Enterprise'' encounters a planet called Magna Roma, which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere, land to ocean ratio, and size. The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th-century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire, as if the Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time: there is also a reference to the Roman god [[Jupiter]] as the namesake of a new line of automobile, and gladiator fights are televised in [[primetime]]. [[Slavery]] on this world has also developed into an institution, with slaves guaranteed medical benefits and old-age pensions, so the workers grew more content and never rebelled. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the society has just found their own version of [[Jesus]], referred simply as "the son" (whose followers they had previously mistaken for [[Solar deity|sun worshipers]]).
*In "[[The Omega Glory]]", the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms. They discover that the Yangs are like Earth's "Yankees" (in other words, Americans) and the Kohms are like Earth's Communists; the Yangs, who had at some point in the past been conquered by the Kohms, had a ritual speech that was word for word identical to the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], and treated the [[U.S. Constitution]] as a sacred text. (A deleted scene from the episode, however, implied that both the Yangs and Kohms were actually descendants of human colonists.)
*In "[[Miri (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Miri]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a planet that is physically identical to Earth. Histories on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th century when scientists had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children (who call themselves the "Onlies").

===Convergent evolution due to contamination===
A similar concept in biology is [[gene flow]]. In this case, a planet may start as different from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way; technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''Star Trek'' used this theory as well: in "[[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Patterns of Force]]", a planet is discovered that has become very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a historian that came to reside there (believing that the Nazi fascism itself was not evil and under benevolent leadership could be "good government"), while in "[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew visits a planet that, 100 years after a book ''Chicago Mobs of the Twenties'' that had been left behind by previous Earth craft, their society resembles mob ruled cities of the [[Prohibition era]] United States.

===Simulated reality===

{{main article|Simulated reality in fiction}}

Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

==Fantasy==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}

===Stranger in a strange land===
[[Image:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Land of Oz|Oz]] and its surroundings.]]
Fantasy authors often want to bring characters from the author's (and the reader's) reality into their created world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within hidden parts of the author's own universe. Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an [[ogre]] or other fantastical beings could live an hour away, but increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C. S.|last2=Hooper|first2=Walter|title=Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0156678977|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as [[Jonathan Swift]] does in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or in the 1949 novel ''[[Silverlock]]'' by [[John Myers Myers]], or be sucked up into a [[tornado]] and land in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. These "[[Lost World (genre)|lost world]]" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a "parallel universe", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic "lost world" can blur into a more explicit "parallel universe" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the "real" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in [[Robert Holdstock]]'s novel ''[[Mythago Wood]]''. Madeleine L'engle, "Wrinkle in Time" series: characters go from the present time to places in the universe.

After the mid-20th century, perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, perhaps because exploration had made many places on the map too clear to write "[[Here be dragons|Here there be dragons]]", many fantasy worlds became completely separate from the author's world.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] is a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] or [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] that connects worlds together, prototypical examples being the wardrobe in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', or the sigil in [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[The Cream of the Jest]]''. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'', [[Chihiro Ogino]] and her parents climb over a small stream into the spirit world. The main difference between this type of story and the "lost world" above, is that the fantasy realm can only be reached by certain people, or at certain times, or after following certain rituals, or with the proper artifact.

In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other [[altered state of consciousness]]. Examples include the ''[[Dream Cycle]]'' stories by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] or the ''[[Thomas Covenant]]'' stories of [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning if the dream-world can have the same "reality" as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme (usually without the dream-world being "another" universe) in the ideas of [[cyberspace]] and [[virtual reality]].

===Between the worlds===
[[Image:Šachovnice.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' -- and the parallel universe [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] found there]]
Most stories in this mold simply transport a character from the real world into the [[fantasy world]] where the bulk of the action takes place. Whatever gate is used &amp;ndash; such as the tollbooth in ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' by [[Norton Juster]], or the mirror in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' &amp;ndash; is left behind for the duration of the story, until the end, and then only if the protagonists will return.

However, in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on one world or the other, but on both, and their interaction. After [[Rick Cook]] introduced a computer programmer into a [[high fantasy]] world, his ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series steadily acquired more interactions between this world and ours. In [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''[[Aaron Allston#Doc Sidhe|Doc Sidhe]]'' our "grim world" is paralleled by a "fair world" where the elves live and history echoes ours. A major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds. [[Margaret Ball (writer)|Margaret Ball]], in ''No Earthly Sunne'', depicts the interaction of our world with Faerie, and the efforts of the Queen of Faerie to deal with the slow drifting apart of Earth and Faerie. [[Poul Anderson]] depicts Hell as a parallel universe in ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', and the need to transfer equivalent amounts of mass between the worlds explains why a [[changeling]] is left for a kidnapped child. Interactions between magical and scientific universes, and the protagonists' attempts to restore and maintain the balance between them, are major plot points in [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Apprentice Adept]]'' series; he depicts two worlds, the "SF" planet Proton and the fantasy-based Phaze, such that every person born in either world has a physical duplicate on the other world. Only when one duplicate has died can the other cross between the worlds. Several of his ''[[Xanth]]'' novels also revolve around interactions between the magical realm of Xanth and "[[mundane|Mundania]]".

Multiple worlds, rather than a pair, increase the importance of the relationships. In ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', there are only our world and [[Narnia]], but in other of C. S. Lewis's works, there are hints of other worlds, and in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', the [[Wood between the Worlds]] shows many possibilities, and the plot is governed by transportation between worlds, and the effort to right problems stemming from them. In [[His Dark Materials]] by [[Philip Pullman]], the two protagonist Lyra and Will find themselves lost amongst many worlds, and travel them looking for the other. In [[Andre Norton]]'s [[Witch World]], begun with a man from Earth being transported to this world, gates frequently lead to other worlds – or come from them. While an abundance of illusions, disguises, and magic that repels attention make certain parts of Witch World look like parallel worlds, some are clearly parallel in that time runs differently in them, and such gates pose a repeated problem in Witch World. In the radio sitcom ''[[Undone (radio series)|Undone]]'', the main character, Edna Turner, prevents people from a parallel version of [[London]] called "Undone" from moving to London and making the city too weird. There are other parallel versions of London, and one of the main plots in the series is the attempt by The Prince to unite all versions of London together. Travel between the [[many-worlds interpretation|manyworlds]] is the central conceit of [[Ian McDonald (British author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''[[Everness (series)|Everness]]'', where the protagonist travels to a parallel London in a world without fossil fuels.

[[Linking room]]s of various types (not all actual rooms) can hook together any number of worlds. The characters may chose only one, but the choice is all important in determining the worlds.

===Fantasy multiverses===
The idea of a [[multiverse]] is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists. Among the most epic and far-ranging fantasy "multiverses" is that of [[Michael Moorcock]].  Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the [[many worlds]] interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], saying: {{cquote|It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in ''New Scientist'' (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}
Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock's ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' stories go far beyond [[alternative history]] to include [[mythology|mythic]] and [[sword and sorcery]] settings as well as some worlds more similar to our own. However, the Eternal Champion himself is incarnate in all of them.

[[Roger Zelazny]] used a mythic [[cosmology]] in his ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]'' series. His protagonist is a member of the royal family of Amber, whose members represent a godlike [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] ruling over a prototypical universe that represents Order. All other universes are increasingly distorted "shadows" of it, ending finally at the other extreme, Chaos, which is the complete negation of the prototype. Travel between these "shadow" universes is only possible by beings descended from the blood of this pantheon. Those "of the blood" can walk through Shadow, imagining any possible reality and then walk to it, making their environment more similar to their desire as they go. It is argued between the characters whether these "shadows" even exist before they're imagined by a member of the royal family of Amber, or if the "shadows'" existence can be seen as an act of godlike creation.

In the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' novels by [[Philip José Farmer]], the idea of godlike protagonists is even more explicit. The background of the stories is a multiverse where godlike beings have created a number of [[pocket universe]]s that represent their own desires. Our own world is part of this series, but our own universe is revealed to be much smaller than it appears, ending at the edge of the Solar System.

The term 'polycosmos' was coined as an alternative to 'multiverse' by the author and editor [[Paul le Page Barnett]], best known by the pseudonym John Grant, and is built from [[Greek language|Greek]] rather than [[Latin]] [[morpheme]]s. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that "all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they're playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There also are multiverses in the [[Warcraft universe]], ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series, and [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Chrestomanci]]'', ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Deep Secret]]'' books and standalone book ''[[A Sudden Wild Magic]]''.

===Fictional universe as alternative universe===
{{main article|Fictional universe}}
There are many examples of the [[meta-fiction]]al idea of having the author's created universe (or any author's universe) rise to the same level of "reality" as the universe we're familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H.G. Wells' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', Myers' ''Silverlock'', and Heinlein's ''Number of the Beast''. [[Fletcher Pratt]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] took the protagonist of the [[Harold Shea]] series through the worlds of Norse myth, [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and the ''[[Kalevala]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorcock|first1=Michael|title=Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy|date=2004|publisher=MonkeyBrain|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1932265074|page=88|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; – without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in "[[Kubla Khan|Xanadu]]", a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established.

Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book's account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in [[Rebecca Lickiss]]'s ''[[Eccentric Circles]]'', an elf is grateful to [[Tolkien]] for transforming elves from dainty little creatures.  These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny's characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world.

Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. [[Stephen King]]'s seven-volume ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King's own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only "real" in King's literary universe (this can be debated as an example of [[breaking the fourth wall]]), and even travel to a world – twice – in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King's world outside of the books.  An early instance of this was in works by [[Gardner Fox]] for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does "exist" and it resonates into the "real world." Some people in the "real world" pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use &lt;!--'use to' here is not an error for 'used to'; this comment is to repel well-meaning bots--&gt; to write stories.

[[Robert Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', quantizes the many parallel fictional universes - in terms of ''fictons''.  A number of fictional universes are accessible along one of the three axes of time which Dr. Jacob Burroughs' "time twister" can access. Each quantum level change - a ''ficton'' - along this time axis corresponds to a different universe from one of several bodies of fiction known to all four travellers in the inter-universal, time travelling vehicle ''Gay Deceiver''.  Heinlein also "[[breaks the fourth wall]]" by having "both Heinleins" (Robert and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]]) visit an inter-universal science-fiction and fantasy convention in the book's last chapter. The convention was convened on Heinlein character [[Lazarus Long]]'s estate on the planet "Tertius" to attract the evil "Black Hats" who pursued the main characters of ''[[The Number of the Beast]]'' through space and time in order to destroy Dr. Burroughs and his invention.  Heinlein continues this literary conceit in ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own "fictons" to unite in the war against the "Black Hats."

Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'', whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe (often naked), and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically [[Fundamentalist Christian]] Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel). Their harrowing adventures through the universes are then revealed to have been "destruction testing" of their souls by [[Loki]], sanctioned by the Creator person of the Christian God ([[Yahweh]]). The Devil appears as the most sympathetic of the gods in the story, who expresses contempt for the other gods' cavalier treatment of the story's main characters.
 
Thus, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' rings in the theological dimension (if only for the purpose of satirizing evangelical Christianity) of parallel universes, that their existence can be used by God (or a number of gods, Loki seems to have made himself available to do Yahweh's dirty work in this novel).  It manages also to have a fictional multiverse angle in that references are made to Heinlein's early SF/fantasy short story "[[They (Heinlein)|They]]," a solipistic tale in which reality is constantly being transmogrified behind the scenes to throw the central character off his guard and keep him from seeing reality as it is, which was set in the same Heinlein fictional universe as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

===Elfland===
{{main article|Álfheim}}

[[Álfheim|Elfland]], or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of [[Elf|elves]] and [[Fairy|fairies]] but [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore.

On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with 'ordinary' land. [[Thomas the Rhymer]] might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell.

This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In [[Norse mythology]], Elfland ([[Alfheim]]) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]]. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the [[elves]], showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people.

While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands – "[[Tam Lin]]" does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place – at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as [[Oisín]], have found that time "catches up" with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands.

Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry – as in [[Josepha Sherman]]'s [[Josepha Sherman#Prince of the Sidhe|Prince of the Sidhe]] series or [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''[[Elf Defense]]'' – and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons – [[Hope Mirrlees]]'s ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'', or [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series proposes that the world of the Elves is a "parasite" universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as "Roundworld" in the novels). In the young teenage book ''[[Mist]]'' by [[Kathryn James]], the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences.

===Isekai===
{{main|Isekai}}
[[Isekai]], is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist's world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them.

==Films==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the [[Land of Oz]] from the mundane world by filming it in [[Technicolor]] while filming the scenes set in [[Kansas]] in [[sepia tone|sepia]]. At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone [[Operation Sea Lion]] in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration.

Another common use of the theme is as a prison for [[villain]]s or [[demons]]. The idea is used in the first two ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]] where [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] villains were sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', where the "8th dimension" is essentially a "phantom zone" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in [[horror films]] include the 1986 film ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'' (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] [[From Beyond (short story)|story]] of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 [[John Carpenter]] film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as [[Satan]], trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in [[Los Angeles]], is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his "father" by reaching in through a [[mirror]].

Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself.  Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) "truth", the seminal example being [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''. Conversely, often in [[film noir]] and [[crime film|crime dramas]], the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally – as in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' – or unintentionally – as in ''[[Angel Heart]]''. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the [[Germany|German]] film ''[[Run Lola Run]]'', the short-lived British [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'' and the [[Great Britain|British]] film ''[[Sliding Doors]]''.

More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film ''[[The Family Man]]'', the 2001 [[cult movie]] ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', which deals with what it terms a "tangent universe" that erupts from our own universe; ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (2001) starring [[Jet Li]], in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li's character is a police officer in one universe and a [[serial killer]] in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'' (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current  ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film's villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] without affecting the continuity of any other ''Star Trek'' film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller ''[[Source Code]]'' employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', the third installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|franchise]], accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternate universe, where the [[Clover (creature)|monster]] and the events in the [[Cloverfield (film)|first film]] transpired. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] has also experimented with this through some of their animated films such as ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' and ''[[Zootopia]]'', where anthropomorphic animals take on the role of (in this case, nonexistent) humans and emulating the latter's characteristics, without abandoning their hereditary own.

==Television==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] storyline.

The 1990s TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their "home" universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes 'Honest Abe' never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low.

One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in order to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841.

A well known and often imitated example is the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode entitled "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]".  The episode introduced an [[Mirror Universe|alternative version of the ''Star Trek'' universe]] where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being [[evil]].  When the parallel universe concept is [[parody|parodied]], the allusion is often to this ''Star Trek'' episode.  A previous episode for the ''Trek'' series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled "[[The Alternative Factor]]". A mad scientist from "our" universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an [[antimatter]]-comprised continuum.  His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos' existence. With help from Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], A traps B along with him in a "anti"-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both [[matter]] oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the ''Codename: Kids Next Door'' episode Operation: P.O.O.L..

The mirror universe of ''Star Trek'' was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', entitled "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", serves as a [[prequel]], introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe.

In the 1970s young adult British SF series [[The Tomorrow People]], its second-season episode, ''A Rift in Time'' (March–April 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an [[alternative history]] where the [[Roman Empire]] developed the [[steam engine]] in the first century CE, had a technological headstart, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine.

Multiple episodes of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' use the concept.  In "Parallel Universe" the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat's alternative is a dog.  "Dimension Jump" introduces a heroic alternative [[Ace Rimmer|Rimmer]], a version of whom reappears in "Stoke Me a Clipper".  The next episode, "Ouroboros", makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes.

''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in ''[[Normal Again]]'' and not really "The Slayer" at all.  In the end, she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive (mother) or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily. In [[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]], Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternative reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale. Her core-universe allies [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]] had become vampires in that timeline.

The plot of the [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] episode of ''[[Charmed]]'', entitled "Brain Drain", features [[The Source (Charmed)|The Source of All Evil]] kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters' magic.

The animated series, ''[[Futurama]]'', had [[The Farnsworth Parabox|an episode]] where the characters travel between "Universe 1" and "Universe A" via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the "evil" ones.

The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of [[déjà vu]] was a major plot line of the first-season finale of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', guest-starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently.

In the 2010 season of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters' original timeline. The show continued to show two "sets" of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths.

In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating parallel realities, leading to the appearance of Cell, who killed the same Future Trunks from a different splitting timeline to come back to the main timeline when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. The Majin Buu Saga later depicts Kaio-Shin Realms and the Afterlife. Its sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', later features separate universes that are in pairs whose numbers add up to the total number of the universe: 13 in this case. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zen'o (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies.

The [[anime]] ''[[Turn A Gundam]]'' attempted to combine all the parallel [[Gundam]] universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the [[metaseries]] into one single reality.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Eureka Seven: AO]]'' takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series' predecessor ''[[Eureka Seven]]''. The ''E7'' series started off in the year 12005, and the ''AO'' world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters' son.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Katekyo Hitman Reborn!]]'' by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc.

The anime ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark "reality" of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''.

The anime series ''[[Bakugan]]'' features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series' hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 &amp; 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology.

In another anime series, ''[[Digimon]]'', there is parallel universe called "digital world". The show's child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and becomes partners and friends. In the third story arc of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'', the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse.

In the anime series ''[[Umineko no Naku Koro ni]]'' the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, in order to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler's dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of "fragments".

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]", Lt. [[Worf]] traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure.

The ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' episode [[Remedial Chaos Theory]], six different timelines and one "prime" timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the [[pizza]]. One timeline, dubbed the "Darkest Timeline", results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock's in "Mirror, Mirror".

In the 2003 anime series of ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories [[Point of divergence|diverged]], apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other.

===As an ongoing subplot===
Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot.  ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' elaborated on the premise of the original series' "Mirror" universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise.  Other examples are the science fiction series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the fantasy/horror series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and the romance/fantasy ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Following the precedent set by ''Star Trek'', these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out "worse" than the "original" universe: in ''Stargate SG-1'' the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable [[Goa'uld]] onslaught; in ''Buffy'', two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to [[Sunnydale]] too late to stop the vampires from taking control; ''Lois &amp; Clark'' repeatedly visits an alternative universe where [[Clark Kent]]'s adoptive parents, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], died when he was ten years of age, and [[Lois Lane]] is also apparently dead.  Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the "original" Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own.

In addition to following ''Star Trek's'' lead, showing the "evil" variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character's presence.

''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they "touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last." He referred to our world's tendency to deny such things as arrogant.

In the season 1 finale of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]] opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Prime Earth sent by [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], Sand Demon, [[King Shark]], and [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]]; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Earth-2 Flash]] after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of the Reverse-Flash, [[Harrison Wells]], arrives in Prime Earth as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes.

The "Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon" series, created by artist Mr Doodleburger, uses footage from the Australian TV drama show [[Home and Away]], but through the use of clever overlaid audio tracks, casts one of the main characters of the show, long running character [[Alf Stewart]] as a vicious violent character in a parallel version of Home and Away. ''see main article'' [[Alf_Stewart#In_popular_culture| Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon Series]]

===Television series involving parallel universes===
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself.
* ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', in which several travelers lost in the Bermuda Triangle find themselves in another world
* ''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]'', in which a family gets trapped in an alternative world
* ''[[Sliders]]'', where a young man invents a worm-hole generator that allows travel to "alternative" Earths.  Several characters travel across a series of "alternative" Earths, trying to get back to their home universe
* ''[[Parallax (TV series)|Parallax]]'', in which a boy discovers portals to multiple parallel universes in his home town
* ''[[Charlie Jade]]'', in which the titular character is accidentally thrown into our universe and is looking for a way back to his own.  The series features three universes - alpha, beta and gamma
* ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', where a man switches between realities whenever he goes to sleep: one in which his wife survived a car accident that killed their son, and one in which his son survived but his wife died
* In the TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', a main element of the series is the loss of balance and the eventual collision of two universes and the moral ramifications of it. Most main characters have a doppelganger who is usually slightly different from their prime selves.
* In the South Korean Drama ''[[Dr. Jin]]'' (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history.
* ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes.
* ''[[Stranger Things]]'', in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions.
* ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in which Barry Allen travels to multiple parallel universes in the multiverse with the help of his super speed.
* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', in which several episodes deal with parallel universes, particularly [[Supernatural (season 13)|the thirteenth season]] which features storylines centering around parallel universes known as Apocalypse World and The Bad Place which appears in the [[backdoor pilot]] to the proposed spinoff ''Supernatural: Wayward Sisters''. Apocalypse World is depicted as a dark post-apocalyptic universe where ''Supernatural's'' main protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester]] were never born and thus could not stop the end of the world.

==Comic books==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] faced by the major two publishers, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The two publishers have used the [[multiverse]] concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major [[Serial (literature)|serial]] protagonists having continuous histories lasting, as in the case of [[Superman]], over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See ''[[Multiverse (DC Comics)]]'' and ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]'')

[[DC Comics]] inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of [[Golden Age]] superheroes the [[Justice Society of America]] now located on [[Earth-Two]], and devised a "mirror universe" scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of [[Earth-Three]] shortly afterward, several years before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an [[Axis victory in World War II]], Earth-S, home to the [[Fawcett Comics]] superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms.

Therefore, comic books in general are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storylines, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', where Marvel has a series called ''[[What If (comics)|What If...]]'' that's devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the "main" universe's continuity. DC's version of "What If..." is the Elseworlds imprint.

DC Comics series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' heralded the return of the Multiverse. ''52'' was a mega-crossover event tied to ''Infinite Crisis'' which was the sequel to the 1980s ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.  The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU.  Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', DC's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[WildStorm]] and an Earth devoted to the [[Charlton Comics]] heroes of DC. ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''Countdown Presents: The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'' and the ''Tales of the Multiverse'' stories expand upon this new Multiverse.

Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the [[X-Men]] books, such as 1981's ''[[Days of Future Past]]'', 1995's ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', and 2006's ''[[House Of M]]''. In addition the [[Squadron Supreme]] is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] comic. [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] is an offshoot of the ''[[X-Men]]'' franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main [[Marvel Universe]] intact. The [[Marvel UK]] line has long had multiverse stories including the [[Jaspers' Warp]] storyline of [[Captain Britain]]'s first series (it was here that the designation [[Earth-616]] was first applied to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]]).

Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] and the [[Ultimates]] (their "Avengers").

The graphic novel [[Watchmen]] is set in an alternative history, in a 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and [[Richard Nixon]] is in his fifth term as President of the United States.  The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating "Cold War" as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades [[Afghanistan]] in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent.

In 1973, [[Tammy (comics)|Tammy]] published ''The Clock and Cluny Jones'', where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] annual 1985 as ''Grandfather's Clock.''

In 1978, [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] published ''The Sentinels''. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] conquered Britain in 1940.

In 1981, [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] published ''Worlds Apart.'' Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published ''Land of No Tears'' where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned.

The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic series]] from [[Archie Comics]]. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another "mirror universe" where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a [[perpendicular]] dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds.

In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], home to Sonic's ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series [[Sonic Underground]] and [[Sonic X]]. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as [[Sailor Moon]], [[Godzilla]], and various titles from [[Marvel Comics]]. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]] and [[Mega Man]].

The various [[Transformers]] comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual [[Botcon]] fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured [[Cliffjumper]], an [[Autobot]] from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the [[Decepticons]] are good. This universe is known as the "Shattered Glass" universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release.

==Video games==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. In one a younger version Link travels to the land of Termina in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''. In the other Link is no longer present allowing Ganon to return to go on a rampage that forced the gods of Hyrule to flood the world in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Nintendo Feature: Zelda Timeline Explained|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|website=Official Nintendo Magazine|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|archivedate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 psychological horror point-and-click adventure game ''[[Dark Seed (video game)|Dark Seed]]'', the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror.

The [[Kingdom Hearts]] series features a Disney/Square Enix's [[Final Fantasy]] multiverse, in which various worlds are based on Disney films or concepts from the Final Fantasy line. The series also introduces the concepts of different "Realms" corresponding to Light, Darkness, Twilight, and Nothingness.

In the 1999 role-playing game ''[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]]'', a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an "entity". Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world in order to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole.

The ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series revolves heavily around alternate universes. [[Xen]] is a location in the first Half-Life game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called [[Combine (Half-Life)|The Combine]] which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species.

In the [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Silent Hill]]'', the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where Silent Hill is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the "Other World".

In the 1993 adventure PC game ''[[Myst]]'', the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched.

In the 1996 adventure PC game ''[[9: The Last Resort]]'', after resolving several mind-blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past "The Tiki Guards"; and a door opens up to "The Void" - actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space.

Both titles of the ''When They Cry'' visual novel series (''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|Higurashi]]'' and ''[[Umineko]]'' for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has 'lost', another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved.

''[[EarthBound]]'' features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness's subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' features a "Magic Potion" item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access "Subspace"; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found.

After the completion of the Special World in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts.

''[[Super Mario 64]]'' features a world called "Tiny Huge Island" which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world.

''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' features a world called "Click Clock Wood", which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' features a dark and twisted parallel version of [[Hyrule]] called the "Dark World".

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages]]'' use a similar concept to that which is used in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''. In those games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game.

In the first half of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule.

[[Resistance: Fall of Man]] is set in alternative universe where Tsarist [[Russia]] never experienced the [[Russian Revolution]] but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive [[alien invasion]] from a species known as the "Chimera", who then proceed to overrun [[Western Europe]], [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]] and much of the [[United States]], and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951.

Each Zone in ''[[Sonic CD]]'' has four variations: Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future, each displaying some subtle and not-so subtle alterations. The series has also seen alternative dimensions in the case of the ''[[Sonic Rush]]'' series, in which Sonic encounters a hero from another world named Blaze the Cat whose nemesis is an alternative counterpart of his own foe, Dr. Eggman. The ''Sonic'' series also makes use of the concept of alternative timelines.

The story of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or "Another World"  and "Home World" which is a [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch]] created by the actions of the heroes of the game's predecessor, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.

In ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', the town "Flipside" (which acts as the game's central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called "Flopside". While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters.

The series ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' is played through several realms and timelines.

''[[Sudeki]]'' is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness.

''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' features an alternative hellish world called "Oblivion", as well as a painting you can climb into and a quest where you enter a dream world.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' takes place in Termina, a parallel world to [[Hyrule]]. Almost all of the characters from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reappear in the game.

''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' pivots around a world of darkness you travel to when you die, which is occupied by World War 1 soldiers.

''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' involves a world, "Aether", having an alternative self in the, "Dark" realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime's essence inside Samus's Phazon Suit.

''[[Crash Twinsanity]]'' features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the "10th dimension," which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite).

''[[Minecraft]]'' features an alternative dimension called "The Nether", that includes a 'hell' like theme. It also contains a second alternative dimension called "The End", home world of the Endermen, a type of monster that spawns rarely in the main world.

''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'' takes place in an alternative universe called "This Side" where in the events of Innocent Sin did not take place and the characters have never met in the past.

The ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the ship that landed the first men on the moon in 1969 is called ''Valiant 11'', rather than [[Apollo 11]]. This universe diverged from ours after [[World War II]], which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.

The MMORPG ''[[City of Heroes]]'' features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse's Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth.

In the text-based science fiction MMORPG ''[[OtherSpace]]'', refugees from Earth's universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called ''Hiverspace'', whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wes Platt]] |title=Otherspace: Down to Earth Chronicle |year=2012 |publisher= |page=139 |quote= ..."You did not 'jump' in time. You have jumped dimensions." Nix clarifies. "Hiverspace's timeline is obviously different from you own. ... Our universe, our Orion Arm, was destroyed by untold number of black holes created by a young Kamir not in control of his own powers. The rest of the Kamir gathered as many people from our universe as possible and rifted us all here. Our universe is gone, but it sound like your version of Normalspace still exists, not destroyed by some cataclysmic event. Such is similar for many others who have been brought here. You are just the newest in a long list that ever growing. But, I am not surprised that you were brought here by Kamir-influenced artifacts. In fact, I would be less surprised if you were not."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor.

2011 action-adventure video game ''[[Portal 2]]'' features a game-mode entitled "Perpetual Testing Initiative" (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist "Bendy" through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled "The Multiverse", and the PeTI's parallel universes are different from the main Half-Life/Portal timeline.

The 2012 visual novel/puzzle video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history.

The 2013 first person shooter ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' features the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The main character is named Booker Dewitt, an homage to physicist ''[[Bryce DeWitt]]''.

The world of the classic cult adventure games of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' created by Ragnar Thornqast, along with its sequels, deals with the existence of two parallel universes&amp;nbsp;– technological (Stark) and magical (Arcadia).

The 2014 crossover video game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' features the iconic characters of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. In the game, heroes and villains from ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' have been sucked into a trans-dimensional storm called "Nexus". Stranded in a strange limbo of clashing universes, these combatants are joined by the same fate to battle for dominance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10334">'''Participatory art''' is an approach to making art which engages [[public participation]] in the creative process, letting them become co-authors, editors, and observers of the work. This type of art is incomplete without viewers' physical interaction. It intends to challenge the dominant form of making art in the West, in which a small class of professional artists make the art while the public takes on the role of passive observer or consumer, i.e., buying the work of the professionals in the marketplace. Commended works by advocates who popularized participatory art include [[Augusto Boal]] in his [[Theater of the oppressed]], as well as [[Allan Kaprow]] in [[happenings]].

One of the earliest usages of the term appears in photographer [[Richard Ross (photographer)]]'s review for the [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art]] journal of the exhibition "Downtown Los Angeles Artists," organized by the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum in 1980. Describing ''in situ'' works by [[Jon Peterson (artist)]], Maura Sheehan and Judy Simonian anonymously placed around Santa Barbara, Ross wrote, "These artists bear the responsibility to the community. Their art is participatory."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ross."At Large In Santa Barbara." ''LAICA Journal''. September–October 1980, Number 28. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Participatory art requires of the artist that they either not be present, or that they somehow are able to recede far enough to become equal with the participants. This is the only way that participants might be offered the agency of creation; without this detail, participants will always respond within the domain of authority of the artist; they will be subjugated in this way, and the work will fail to be participatory. This detail is centrally important in asserting Participation as a form in itself, and effectively differentiates Participation from interactive, community based art and socially engaged art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11152406/Participation_Hosting_And_Mimesis_The_Double_Being|title=Participation, Hosting And Mimesis: The Double Being|last=Mount|first=Andrew|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these techniques can include the presence of the artist, as it will not impinge upon the outcome of the work in the same way.

There are various degrees of participation from nominal manipulation of an object like the wearable sculptures of [[Lygia Clark]] to the relinquishing of the artist's body to the whims of the audience in the 1974 performance ''Rhythm 0'' by [[Marina Abramović]]. New media theorist Beryl Graham has compared the varying degrees of participation in the arts to the eight rungs of power described in [[Sherry Arnstein]]'s "Ladder of Citizen Participation"—ranging from manipulation to token consulting, to complete citizen control. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Beryl|date=|title=What kind of participative system? Critical Vocabularies from new media art.|url=|journal=The 'do-it-yourself' artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media|volume=|pages=290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall/Winter issue of Oregon Humanities magazine, writer Eric Gold describes "an artistic tradition called '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|social practice]],' which refers to works of art in which the artist, audience, and their interactions with one another are the medium. While a painter uses pigment and canvas, and a sculptor wood or metal, the social practice artist often creates a scenario in which the audience is invited to participate. Although the results may be documented with photography, video, or otherwise, the artwork is really the interactions that emerge from the audience's engagement with the artist and the situation."

Participatory or interactive art creates a dynamic collaboration between the artist, the audience and their environment. Participatory art is not just something that you stand still and quietly look at–it is something you participate in. You touch it, smell it, write on it, talk to it, dance with it, play with it, learn from it. You co-create it. 

== Related fields ==
It is important to point out that there has been some nominal obfuscation of Participatory Art, causing its appreciation as a distinct form to be stymied. It is most likely that this occurred simultaneously with the development of the term [[Relational Aesthetics]] by [[Special:BookSources/2840660601|Bourriaud]] in the late 1990s. Some other art making techniques, such as [[Community arts|'community-based art']], '[[interactive art]]', or '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|socially-engaged art]]' have been (mis)labelled as Participatory art, simply because the subtleties of distinction are not always clearly understood or cared about. Many forms of popular culture and media beyond visual art have grown increasingly participatory with the rise of the [[Internet]] and [[social media]], which allow users to participate at a distance.

== Examples ==
[[Janet Cardiff]] has created various audio tours that users experience by walking site-specific routes and listening to soundscapes composed by the artist. 

[[Figment (arts event)]] is an annual showcase of participatory art in New York City.

[[Antony Gormley]] has involved the public in the creation of several works, most notably [[One &amp; Other]] which invited hundreds of participants to occupy the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|vacant plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] and perform or otherwise contribute to the work. 

[[Carsten Höller]] has created interactive installations like Test Site (2006), which invites participants to play on giant slides installed in the [[Tate Modern]]. 

[[Allan Kaprow]] pioneered the field of participatory art with his [[Happening]] events staged in 1960's New York City, which used physical installations and prompts to facilitate aesthetic experiences for participants.  

[http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/ Learning to Love you More] (2002–2009) was a work of [[Internet art]] by [[Miranda July]] and [[Harrell Fletcher]] that invited participants to submit responses to written prompts, and displayed an archive of the resulting works of [[conceptual art]].

[[Adrian Piper]] led a series of events titled Funk Lessons (1982 –1984) that combined participatory dance-parties with conversations and lectures about African-American culture.

[http://www.publicartstation.org Public Art Stations] (2013 - present) allow the public freedom in the creation of works, usually in watercolor.

== Influences ==
Folk and tribal art can be considered to be a predecessor or model for contemporary "participatory art" in that many or all of the members of the society participate in the making of "art". However, the ideological issue of ''use'' arises at this point because art made in the institutions of art is by default, already part of the art world, and therefore it's perceived ''use'' is entirely different to any ritualistic or traditional practices expressed by folk or tribal groups. As the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl wrote, the tribal group "has no specialization or professionalization; its division of labor depends almost exclusively on sex and occasionally on age, and only rarely are certain individuals proficient in any technique to a distinctive degree ... the same songs are known by all the members of the group, and there is little specialization in composition, performance or instrument making.” &lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, ''Music in Primitive Culture'', Cambridge, Harvard 1956, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tie-dye.png|thumb|right200px|A swirling psychedelic pattern]]
'''Psychedelic art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist [[Humphry Osmond]]) means "mind manifesting".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".  In common parlance "psychedelic art" refers above all to the art movement of the late [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].  Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock music]].  Concert posters, album covers, [[liquid light shows]], liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

== Features ==

* Fantastic, metaphysical and surrealistic subject matter
* [[Kaleidoscope|Kaleidoscopic]], [[fractal art|fractal]] or [[paisley (design)|paisley]] patterns
* Bright and/or highly contrasting colors
* Extreme depth of detail or stylization of detail. Also so called [[Horror vacui]] style.
* Morphing of objects or themes and sometimes [[collage]]
* [[Phosphenes]], spirals, concentric circles, [[diffraction]] patterns, and other [[entoptic phenomenon|entoptic]] motifs
* Repetition of [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]
* Innovative typography and hand-lettering, including warping and transposition of positive and negative spaces

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration.  The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration.  Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations.  Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science.  Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud's theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally "turned on" by [[Albert Hofmann]]'s discovery of LSD.

The early examples of "psychedelic art" are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the [[Surrealist art]] movement, such as [[Remedios Varo]] and [[André Masson]]. It should also be noted that these came from writers involved in the Surrealist movement.  [[Antonin Artaud]] writes of his peyote experience in ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara'' (1937).  [[Henri Michaux]] wrote ''[[Misérable Miracle]]'' (1956), to describe his experiments with [[mescaline]] and also [[hashish]].

[[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (1954) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD.  For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research.  Hofmann saw the drug's potential for  poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer [[Ernst Jünger]]'s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist [[Oscar Janiger]].  Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist's choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD.  The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist.  The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture.  Beatnik poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a "complete disorientation of the senses" (to paraphrase [[Arthur Rimbaud]]).  They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine.  LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==
[[File:San Francisco Oracle Cover Vol.1 No.5, January 1967.jpg|thumb|Cover of the San Francisco Oracle, Volume 1 No.5, January 1967.]]
Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The "Fillmore Posters" were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist [[Bridget Riley]] became famous for her op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. [[Mati Klarwein]] created psychedelic masterpieces for [[Miles Davis|Miles Davis']] Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for [[Carlos Santana]] Latin Rock.  [[Pink Floyd]] worked extensively with London-based designers, [[Hipgnosis]] to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Warren Dayton]] and Art Bevacqua and New York artists [[Peter Max]] and [[Milton Glaser]] all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the [[Summer of Love]] focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the [[hippie]] counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion  that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.  The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  "Zap Comix" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], Victor Moscoso, [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.  [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, "The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]", whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself.  LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper.  Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs.  Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max.  A caption explains that each of Max's clocks "transposes time into multi-fantasy colors."&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm's length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''68/69 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1968. pgs. 45, 75, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Campbell's soup ran a poster promotion that promised to "Turn your wall souper-delic!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 798&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The art of peter max.jpg|thumb|The Art Of Peter Max]]

The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pgs. 443, 102, 76, 85, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pgs. 39, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Brian Wells explains, "The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Even the term "psychedelic" itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean "anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pgs. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Puns using the concept of "tripping" abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was "great on trips!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All-American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

[[File:Juliasetsdkpictfield3.jpg|thumb|Fractal artwork created using the [[Julia set]]]]
[[Computer art]] has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision.  [[Fractal]] generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation.  Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The "digital revolution" was indeed heralded early on as the "New LSD" by none other than [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name="Leary, Horowitz &amp; Marshall 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Timothy Leary|Leary, Timothy]]; Horowitz, Michael; Marshall, Vicky| title = Chaos and Cyber Culture| publisher = Ronin Publishing| year = 1994| isbn = 0-914171-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthofer 1997"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Ruthofer, Arno|title = Think for Yourself; Question Authority|    year = 1997 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html  | accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies.  The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic [[poster art]], but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what [[digital art]] and [[computer graphics]] software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the [[convolutional neural network]] [[DeepDream]] finds and enhance patterns in images purely via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy).  Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and [[aesthetics]], particularly the aesthetics of [[Rave|rave culture]].  But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an [[entactogen]].  Development of new psychedelics such as [[2C-B]] and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]]) are truly psychedelic, and these novel psychedelics are fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist's vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia.  Well-known examples are [[Amanda Sage]], [[Alex Grey]], and [[Robert Venosa]].  These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are "psychedelic", are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization.  While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15191">'''Relational art''' or '''relational aesthetics''' is a mode or tendency in [[fine art]] practice originally observed and highlighted by French art critic [[Nicolas Bourriaud]]. Bourriaud defined the approach as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p.113&lt;/ref&gt; The artist can be more accurately viewed as the "catalyst" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origin of the term==
{{Main article|Traffic (art exhibition)}}
One of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of relational art&lt;ref&gt;As a term, "relational art" has become accepted over "relational aesthetics" by the art world and Bourriaud himself as indicated by the 2002 exhibition ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'' at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], curated by Bourriaud.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book ''Esthétique relationnelle'' (''Relational Aesthetics'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition ''[[Traffic (art exhibition)|Traffic]]'' curated by Bourriaud at [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bennett. "Public Relations: Nicolas Bourriaud Interview."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Traffic'' included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as [[Henry Bond]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Liam Gillick]], Christine Hill, [[Carsten Höller]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Miltos Manetas]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Philippe Parreno]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film ''[[Trafic]]''(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a ''denoument'' that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.&lt;ref name="Bishop pp.54-55"&gt;Bishop, Claire. "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Relational Aesthetics'', pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Traffic, Catalogue Capc Bordeaux'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutualart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/TRAFFIC-CONTROL/FBC1A92B4838F138|title=TRAFFIC CONTROL|author=|date=|website=www.mutualart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relational aesthetics''===
Bourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases "to take shelter behind Sixties art history",&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p.7&lt;/ref&gt; and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s [[internet]] boom, using terminology such as [[user-friendliness]], [[interactivity]] and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 book ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', Bourriaud describes ''Relational Aesthetics'' as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, Caroline Schneider and Jeanine Herman. ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Art===
Bourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space." The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims "the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at [[New York University]], coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are "that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered." The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Keywords in Subversive Film / Media Aesthetics| last = Stam| first = Robert| publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year = 2015| isbn = 1118340612| location = |page = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated ''collectively'', rather than in the space of individual consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writer and director [[Ben Lewis (writer)|Ben Lewis]] has suggested that relational art is the new "ism", in analogue with "ism"s of earlier periods such as [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", published in 2004 in ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', [[Claire Bishop]] describes the aesthetic of [[Palais de Tokyo]] as a "laboratory", the "curatorial modus operandi" of art produced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop writes, "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As [[Hal Foster]] warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of [[poststructuralist]] theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.”&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop also asks, "if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what ''types'' of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She continues that "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically [[democracy|democratic]], as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of [[subjectivity]] as whole and of community as immanent togetherness."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Traffic Control", published one year later in ''[[Artforum]]'', artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, "Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics."

==Exhibitions==
In 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'', "an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/i1_a/2003_02_25_i1_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Nicolas Bourriaud and Karen Moss |website=Stretcher.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibited artists included [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Jens Haaning]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Gillian Wearing]] and [[Andrea Zittel]]. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's "snapshot" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating "different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb |first=Chris |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r3_a/2002_11_13_r3_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Touch - Relational Art from the 1990’s to Now |website=Stretcher.org |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show ''Theanyspacewhatever''. The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/anyspace/exhibition.html|title=theanyspacewhatever|author=|date=|website=web.guggenheim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David-harp.jpg|right|thumb|[[David]] playing his harp (unknown artist, c. 960). The book of [[Psalms]], included in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and said to have been written largely by David, is one of the earliest collections of sacred music, and still plays a role in the liturgies of the two religions.]]

'''Religious music''' (also '''sacred music''') is music performed or composed for [[religion|religious]] use or through religious influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/genre/religious-ma0000004431|title=Religious Music Genre Overview {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ritual music''' is music, sacred or not, performed or composed for or as [[ritual]].

==Christian music==
{{main|Church music|Christian music}}
According to some scholars, the earliest music in the Christian Church came from Jewish worship music, with some additional [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] influence.{{sfn|Conomos|2003}} It is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking, or speaking with an understood ritual cadence.&lt;ref&gt;Foley 2008,{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another opinion that the roots of early Christian music come from the early ascetic monastic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin and Gibbs 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic Music ==
Islamic "songs" come in the form of prayers (In Arabic, prayer is ''Salah)'' that occur 5 times a day. These prayers are conducted by facing Mecca and having both knees to the ground bowing and reciting these prayers and usually are recitations of the Islamic Holy word the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. Rasheid|first=Omar|date=|title=Muslim Prayer and Public Spheres: An Interpretation of the Quranic Verse 29:45|url=|journal=Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology|volume=68|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prayers occur of the day and connect the Muslim people through a series of melodic prayers that often become amplified through the city. In Islam the implication of prayer and in this case the ''Salah'' is for ritual since it is believed to be the direct word of God that shall be performed as a collective, as well as individually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"What shall I say of their prayer? For they pray with such concentration and devotion that I was astonished when I was able to see it personally and observe it with my own eyes.” (Riccold De Monte in the year 1228).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The origin of the art of prayer in all Abrahamic religions is to glorify God and the same goes for Islam. The ''Al Salat'' is the most widely used word to mean institutionalized prayer and is one of the oldest forms of prayer in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalee|first=Mohammed|date=1999|title=The Foundation of Muslim Prayer|url=|journal=Medieval Encounters|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islamic prayer, traditions, and ideals had influence from these Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hienz|first=Justin|date=August 2008|title=SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURY RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON THE SALĀT RITUAL|url=|journal=THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIMS PRAYER|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of origination of Salah came from the Muslim prophet Muhammad (the Messenger of God) in a cave as he began to worship Allah (God). It is believed that through this act of worship Mohammad interacted with the Abrahamic prophet Moses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now these "prayers" come in the form of recitations of the Quran and poems written by prophets of the faith.

==== The Spread of Islamic Prayer ====
Besides the spread of Islam through Arabia by prophets it spread through trade routes like the Silk Road and through conflict of war. Through the Silk road traders and members of the early Muslim faith were able to go to countries such as China and create mosques around 627 C. E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11321/islam-enters-far-east/|title=Islam Enters the Far East - The Religion of Islam|last=waheed|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As men from the Middle East came to China they would get married to these Asian women, which led to a spreading of the faith and traditions of Islam in multiplicities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Crusades in the 9th and 10th century encouraged the spread of Islam through the invasions of Latin Christian soldiers and Muslim soldiers into each other's land. The whole conflict began on the premises of a Holy Land and which group of people owned these lands that led to these foes invading their respective lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/why-muslims-see-the-crusades-so-differently-from-christians|title=Why Muslims See the Crusades So Differently from Christians|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the religion itself spread so did its implications of ritual, such as prayer.

The earliest synagogal music was based on the same system as that in the [[Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Talmud]], [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], who had served in the sanctuary [[Levite|Levitical]] choir, told how the choristers went to the synagogue from the orchestra by the [[altar]] (Talmud, Suk. 53a), and so participated in both services.

{{nihongo|'''Rice paddy art'''|田んぼアート|tambo āto|}} is an art form originating in [[Japan]] where people plant rice of various types and colors to create images in a [[paddy field]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/asia/26japan.html|title=Japanese Village Creates Art From Hues of Rice|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=2010-07-15|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201208190010

== History ==
[[File:Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata.jpg|thumb|Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata]]
In 1993, the people of [[Inakadate, Aomori|Inakadate]], in [[Aomori Prefecture]], were looking for a way to revitalize their village. Archaeological exploration led to a realization that rice had been grown in the area for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; To honor this history, the villagers started a rice field behind the town hall. With the [[Paddy field|paddy]] as a canvas, the villagers cultivated and used four different types&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; of heirloom and modern strains of rice to create a giant picture in the field. To allow viewing of the whole picture, a mock castle tower 22 meters high was erected at the village office.&lt;ref name="jtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070826x1.html|title=Homegrown art|last=Hani|first=Yoko|date=2007-08-26|publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 200,000 people visited the village to see the art.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt;

Another observation tower was built looking down the Tambo art location 2 at [[roadside station|Michi no eki]] Inakadate nicknamed “Yayoi no sato”&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; or a village of prehistoric [[Yayoi period]]. Both places charge admission fees, while visitors are encouraged to take bus serving both location 1 and 2 to avoid traffic jam.&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; In August 2015, a video camera was installed for both locations and started live stream the art,&lt;ref name=livecam&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inakadate-tanboart.net/news/2015/08/post-1.html |title= Tambo Art has its website now|language=ja| publisher= Inakadate, Aomori|date= 2015-08-05|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were registered on [[Google Street View]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2015090400027/|title=Tambo art is on Google Street View|publisher= Inakadate Village|language=ja|date= 2015-10-19 |accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A winter campaign since 2016 has been held on location 2 with instruction initially by snow artist Simon Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2017113000016/|title= Winter tambo art 2018 will be held|date=2018-01-15|language=ja|publisher= Inakadate Village|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first nine years, the farmers created a simple picture of Mount Iwaki&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; before going to more complex designs.

Following Inakadate's example, other villages such as [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]] in Yamagata prefecture have started to create their own tambo art.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

=== Inakadate designs===

== Production ==
Every April, the villagers meet and decide what to plant for the year.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; Prior to planting, farmers sketch out the designs on computers to figure out where and how to plant the rice.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/5965073/Farmers-create-coloured-rice-murals-in-Japan.html|title=Farmers create coloured rice 'murals' in Japan |date=08-03|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 700 people helped plant rice.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; In Inakadate, the fields used are approximately 15,000 square meters in area.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1198381/Bizarre-spectacle-giant-crop-murals-covering-rice-fields-Japan.html|title=Bizarre spectacle of the giant crop murals covering rice fields in Japan|date=2009-07-09|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements between landowners have allowed for larger pictures to be created.

== Advertising controversy ==
In 2008, it was planned to change the lower part of the field to include the logos of [[Japan Airlines]] and To-o Nippo, a local newspaper, for a reported 2 million yen to offset increased costs. The members of the local landowners' organization, along with the former mayor, protested, saying that the land would not be leased from the following year if the plan to display advertising logos was not abandoned. The village revitalization group voted by a narrow margin not to include the advertisements, and the seedlings that were planted were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0704/TKY200807040155.html 田んぼアート、広告いらない 地権者抗議で苗抜き取り] – Asahi Shimbun, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp 田んぼアートの広告削除へ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707015517/http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp# |date=2008-07-07 }} – Too Nippo, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/select/wadai/horidashi/news/20080705mog00m040033000c.html 田んぼアート もったいない? 企業広告絵柄を抜き取り]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Mainichi Shimbun, 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Child's Drawing of the Tooth Fairy.jpg|thumb|Child's drawing of the Tooth Fairy]]

The '''Tooth Fairy''' is a [[fantasy]] figure of early childhood in [[Western world|Western]] and Western-influenced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, John R.; McKee, Judy S.; Jernigan, Louise F., ''Psychological Reports'', Vol. 46 (3, Pt. 1), June 1980. "Children's belief in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy". pp. 691–694.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[folklore]] states that when children lose one of their [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]], they should place it underneath their pillow and the Tooth Fairy will visit while they sleep, replacing the lost tooth with a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Linda S.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklore|year=2007|publisher=Facts on file Inc|location=NY, NY, United States of America|isbn=0-8160-5699-4|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy to collect is practiced in various countries.

==Origins==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
In [[Northern Europe]], there was a tradition of ''tand-fé'' or tooth fee, which was paid when a child lost their first tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigfússon |authorlink2=Guðbrandur Vigfússon |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2 |work=[[William Craigie|William A. Craigie]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press ]]|year= 1957}} [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html s.v. ''tannfé'' first edition available on ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is recorded in writings as early as the [[Edda]]s, which are the earliest written record of [[Norsemen|Norse]] and Northern European traditions.

The reward left varies by country, the family's economic status, amounts the child's peers report receiving and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patcas, Hubertus JM van Waes, Moritz M Daum and Markus A Landolt. ''Medical Journal of Australia'', Vol. 207, 2017. "Tooth Fairy guilty of favouritism!". pp 482-486.{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/11/tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism|title=tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Helen, Joy Cullen. ''Australian Journal of Early Childhood'', Vol. 28, 2003. "The Tooth Fairy Comes, or Is It Just Your Mum and Dad?: A Child's Construction of Knowledge". pp 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 survey by [[Visa Inc.]] found that American children receive $3.70 per tooth on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57600762/tooth-fairy-inflation-flies-high|title=Tooth Fairy inflation flies high|date=30 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tooth fairy leaving less money|publisher=UPI Quirks in the News|date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], other [[superstition]]s arose surrounding children's teeth. In [[England]], for example, children were instructed to burn their baby teeth in order to save the child from hardship in the afterlife. Children who didn't consign their baby teeth to the fire would spend eternity searching for them in the afterlife. The [[Vikings]], it is said, paid children for their teeth. In the Norse culture, children's teeth and other articles belonging to children were said to bring good luck in battle, and Scandinavian warriors hung children's teeth on a string around their necks. Fear of witches was another reason to bury or burn teeth. In medieval Europe, it was thought that if a witch were to get hold of one's teeth, it could lead to them having total power over him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recess.ufl.edu/transcripts/2005/0823.shtml|title=Legends of the Tooth Fairy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern incarnation of these traditions into an actual Tooth Fairy has been dated to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Tooth fairy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tooth%20fairy "Tooth fairy,"] [[Merriam-Webster]].com, 2015 (viewed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; or 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Heidi|title=8 Popular Tooth Myths Debunked|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/8-popular-tooth-myths-debunked-8#slide-8|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=[[Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is an earlier reference to the tooth fairy in a 1908 "Household Hints" item in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'':
{{quotation|"Tooth Fairy.
Many a refractory child will allow a loose tooth to be removed if he knows about the Tooth Fairy.  If he takes his little tooth and puts it under the pillow when he goes to bed the Tooth Fairy will come in the night and take it away, and in its place will leave some little gift.  It is a nice plan for mothers to visit the 5 cent counter and lay in a supply of articles to be used on such occasions.

==Appearance==
Unlike [[Santa Claus]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Easter Bunny]], there are few details of the Tooth Fairy's appearance that are consistent in various versions of the myth. A 1984 study conducted by [[Rosemary Wells]] revealed that most, 74 percent of those surveyed, believed the Tooth Fairy to be female, while 12 percent believed the Tooth Fairy to be neither male nor female and 8 percent believed the Tooth Fairy could be either male or female.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FkdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3809,192140&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=Tooth Fairy Lore Extracted|date=2 February 1984|work=[[Toledo Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her findings regarding the Tooth Fairy's appearance, Wells explained - "You've got your basic Tinkerbell-type Tooth Fairy with the wings, wand, a little older and whatnot. Then you have some people who think of the tooth fairy as a man, or a bunny rabbit or a mouse."&lt;ref name="The Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6626,6866738&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=The tooth fairy: friend or foe?|date=31 July 1991|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review of published children's books and popular artwork found the Tooth Fairy to also be depicted as a child with wings, a [[pixie]], a [[dragon]], a blue mother-figure, a flying [[ballerina]], two little old men, a dental hygienist, a potbellied flying man smoking a cigar, a bat, a bear and others. Unlike the well-established imagining of Santa Claus, differences in renderings of the Tooth Fairy are not as upsetting to children.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;
 
===Depiction on coins and currency===
Starting in 2011, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] began selling special sets for newborn babies, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, "Oh Canada" and the Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy quarters, which were issued only in 2011 and 2012, were packaged separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=2012%20CANADA%20Tooth%20Fairy%20Gift%20Sett%20Special%20quarter%20reverse%20Mint%20sealed%20&amp;_itemId=200712964004 2012 CANADA Tooth Fairy Gift Sett Special quarter reverse Mint sealed | eBay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief==
{{See also|Paternalistic deception}}
Belief in the Tooth Fairy is viewed in two very different ways. On the one hand, children believing is seen as part of the trusting nature of childhood. Conversely, belief in the Tooth Fairy is frequently used to label adults as being too trusting and ready to believe anything.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;[[Rosemary Wells|Wells, Rosemary]]. "The Making of an Icon: The Tooth Fairy in North American Folklore and Popular Culture" in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays''. Peter Narváez ed., 1997. pp 426-446. [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While parents are often unsure of themselves when promoting the fiction of the Tooth Fairy, the majority of children report positive outcomes. Upon learning the Tooth Fairy is not real, 75% of children reported liking the custom; 20% were neutral and 3% were not in favor and said they did not intend to continue the practice.

Parents tend to view the myth as providing comfort for children in the loss of their tooth.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; Research finds that belief in the Tooth Fairy may provide such comfort to a child experiencing fear or pain resulting from the loss of a tooth.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Cindy Dell. "Flight Toward Maturity: The Tooth Fairy" in ''Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America''. [[University of Chicago Press]], 1995. pp 355-364.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers especially seem to value a child's belief as a sign that their "baby" is still a child and is not "growing up too soon".&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; By encouraging belief in a fictional character, parents allow themselves to be comforted that their child still believes in fantasy and is not yet "grown up".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Children often discover the Tooth Fairy is imaginary as part of the 5- to 7-year shift, often connecting this to other gift-bearing imaginary figures (such as [[Santa Claus]] and the [[Easter Bunny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sameroff, Arnold and Susan C. Mcdonough. ''Phi Delta Kappan'', Vol. 76, 1994, "Educational implications of developmental transitions: revisiting the 5- to 7-year shift".&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Vicki Lansky]] advises parents to tell their children early that the tooth fairy pays a whole lot more for a perfect tooth than for a decayed one. According to Lansky, some families leave a note with the payment, praising the child for good dental habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansky|first=Vicki|title=Practical parenting tips|publisher=Unicorn books|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7806-005-1|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research findings suggest a possible relationship between a child's continued belief in the Tooth Fairy (and other fictional characters) and [[false memory syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe1, Gabrielle F. and Eric Smith. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'', Volume 22, Issue 5, pages 625–642, July 2008. "The tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth: how belief in the Tooth Fairy can engender false memories".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (or Ratón Pérez, "Pérez Mouse" in English) is a figure popular in Spanish and Hispanic American cultures, similar to the Tooth Fairy, originating in Madrid in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez". The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] was used by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela&lt;ref name="Producto"&gt;[http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html ¡Producto Registrado!: Agosto 1998: Centuria Dental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |date=20 October 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

In [[Italy]], the Tooth Fairy is also often replaced by a small mouse, named ''Topolino''.

In [[France]] and French-speaking [[Belgium]], this character is called ''la petite souris'' ("[[The Little Mouse|the little mouse]]"). From parts of [[Lowland Scotland]] comes a tradition similar to the fairy mouse: a white fairy rat who purchases children's teeth with coins.

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and specially in [[Biscay]], there is ''Mari Teilatukoa'' (Mary from the roof), who lives in the roof of the [[baserri]] and catches the teeth thrown by the children.

In some [[Asia|Asian countries]], such as [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], when a child loses a tooth, it is customary for him or her to throw it onto the roof if it came from the lower jaw, or into the space beneath the floor if it came from the upper jaw. While doing this, the child shouts a request for the tooth to be replaced with the tooth of a mouse. This tradition is based on the fact that the teeth of mice grow for their entire lives, a characteristic of all rodents. In some cultures in India, children bury their teeth in the soil near big trees.

In [[Japan]], a different variation calls for lost upper teeth to be thrown straight down to the ground and lower teeth straight up into the air; the idea is that incoming teeth will grow in straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeler|first=Selby B.|title=Throw Your Tooth on the Roof: Tooth Traditions from Around the World|year=1998|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-6181-5238-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Middle Eastern countries (including [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]), there is a tradition of throwing a baby tooth up into the sky to the sun or to [[Allah]]. This tradition may originate in a pre-Islamic offering, and dates back to at least the 13th century. It is also mentioned by [[Izz bin Hibat Allah Al Hadid]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hamdani&gt;Al Hamdani, Muwaffak and Wenzel, Marian.

[[File:William Michael Harnett Still life Violin and Music.jpg|thumb|''Still life Violin and Music'' by [[William Michael Harnett]] ]]

'''''Trompe-l'œil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tʁɔ̃p lœj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70]]
[[File:Colyer, Edwaert - Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Trompe-l'œil painting by [[Evert Collier]]]]
[[File:Escaping criticism-by pere borrel del caso.png|thumb|''Escaping Criticism'' by [[Pere Borrell del Caso]], 1874]]

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'œil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) and [[Melozzo da Forlì]] (1438–1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sù|di sotto in sù]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489–1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460–1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'œil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting.  Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'œil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'œil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence – An Interview with Cinematographer István Borbás|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'œil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'œil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].

The depiction of '''winter landscapes in [[Western art history|Western art]]''' begins in the 15th century. Wintry and snowy landscapes are not seen in early European painting since most of the subjects were religious. Painters avoided landscapes in general for the same reason. The first depictions of snow began to occur in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"&gt;''Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future'', by David Huddart &amp; Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780470749609}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s that feature snow as a [[theme (arts)|theme]] are mostly [[landscapes]], even if some of these works involve [[religious]] or even [[fantasy]] landscapes. Most of these winter landscapes in art history are [[plein-air]] depictions of winter scenes, using the quality of gray winter light to create the special winter atmosphere.
Depiction of snow in Europe is essentially a northern European theme.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kent | first = Neil | title = Soul of the North: a Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-86189-067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

===Between Renaissance and the eve of Romanticism===
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|thumb|upright|''February'', attributed to [[Limbourg brothers|Paul Limbourg]], or the "Rustic painter", 1412 and 1416, [[Musée Condé]].]]
Early European painters generally did not depict snow since most of their paintings were of religious subjects. The first artistic representations of snow came in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt; Because frequent snowfall is a part of winter in northern European countries, depiction of snow in Europe began first in the northern European countries.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"/&gt;

Since the early 15th century, wintry scenes had been represented by artists in parts of large sculptural works on churches and even on a smaller scale in private devotional scripts such as the [[book of hours]], a devotional collection of texts, [[prayer]]s and [[psalm]]s. These were often [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as ''[[Labours of the Months]],'' a cycle of twelve paintings that illustrated the social life, the agricultural tasks, the weather, and the landscape for each month of the year. January and February were typically shown as snowy, as is ''February'' in the famous cycle of the ''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', illustrated 1412–1416. Some snowy scenes also appear in a set of early 14th-century frescoes created by Master Wenceslas for the Bishop's Palace at Trento, showing people throwing snowballs at each other,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Heine, "The First Time: Innovations in Art", Bucher, Munich, 2007 at 33&lt;/ref&gt; and in a detail of [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Effects of Good Government in the City and Countryside'' (1337–39).&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "The Emergence of the Winter Landscape", Journal of Art in Society,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com/the-emergence-of-the-winter-landscape.html|title="The Emergence of the Winter Landscape",|publisher=www.artinsociety.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjws.blogspot.se/2014/01/illuminated-manuscript-snow.html|title=illuminated-manuscript-snow|publisher=bjws.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, landscapes had not yet developed as a genre in art, which explains the scarcity of winter scenes in medieval painting. Snow was not depicted in art except where it had a context, such as in the winter months of calendars.

During the Early [[Northern Renaissance]] and even more during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th century, interest in landscape painting was increasing. The winter of 1564–1565 was said to be the longest and most severe for more than a hundred years&amp;nbsp;– the beginning of a cold period in northern Europe now called the [[Little Ice Age]]. For the next 150 years, northern European winters were comparatively snowy and harsh. Crop failures, heavy snowfalls and advancing glaciers that consumed Alpine pastures and villages made the era a grim one for European peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english|title=brief-history-snow-britain|publisher=/www.theguardian.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|275px|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565, oil on wood, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]]] 
It was early in the frigid winter of 1565 that Bruegel created ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/hunters-in-the-snow-winter/WgFmzFNNN74nUg?projectId=art-project|title=hunters-in-the-snow-winter|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first true winter landscape painting. It was part of a series that illustrated the months, something thematically similar to the traditional Flemish [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g. the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the snowy ''Hunters'' (December–January), it included ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August). ''The Hunters'' depicts village life in a snowbound Flemish setting, showing not only hunters with pikes trudging off with their dogs to seek game, but also villagers gathered around a fire, frozen ponds with skaters, and houses and churches in the distance&amp;nbsp;– all against a fanciful backdrop of snow-covered mountains. The series was commissioned in 1565 by a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]]. The paintings by Flemish artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were on a larger scale than calendar paintings; they measured approximately three feet by five feet (0.9 by 1.5 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruegel continued to depict snow in his paintings. He created the first nativity scene to include snow, ''[[Adoration of the Magi in a Winter Landscape]]'', which is also the earliest known painting to actually depict falling snow. He also started a vogue for [[Netherlandish]] winter painting. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a now Protestant (Calvinist) society, which preferred non-religious themes such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]], and landscape painting. The tradition of painting landscapes continued well into the 19th century and developed into the [[Romantic painting|Romantic landscape]]. Between 1780 and 1820, following the initial vogue in the 16th century for Netherlandish winter landscapes, winter subjects again become popular. However, this time winter landscapes became popular in their own right, as the beginning of the Romantic movement created a new interest in the landscape. This new interest, combined with the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe, gave landscape painting for its own sake, not simply as a backdrop to a scene or a setting, a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than it had held earlier.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt;

===Romantic landscape painting===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Winterlandschaft (London).jpg|thumbnail|288px| [[Caspar David Friedrich]]: ''Winter Landscape'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1811)]]
Later, after a relatively warm period that coincided with the end of the 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age]], the European climate turned cool again, heading for a trough whose lowest point was in the second decade of the 19th century. In 1809, a series of major volcanic eruptions heralded the arrival of a particularly cold period as the clouds of ash partially blocked out the sun. The decade from 1810 to 1819 was the coldest in England since the 17th century. In 1812, the French [[Grande Armée]] was forced to retreat from Moscow by the advancing winter&amp;nbsp;– known to the Russians as General Snow. These climactic events played a great part in the development of a new art genre, the winter landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the growing Romantic movement intensified interest in landscape painting, including winter landscapes. Practitioners included the German artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who depicted remote and wild landscapes. Caspar David Friedrich was a romantic landscape painter, and was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes as austere, forbidding and desolate. His winter scenes are solemn and still. They are often painted [[plein-air]], with the artist using the thin, gray light of winter to create an appropriate atmosphere and illustrate the effect of light reflected off snow. According to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which "no man has yet set his foot". Although based on direct observation, his landscapes did not reproduce nature but were painted to create a dramatic effect, using nature as a mirror of human emotions. His aim was a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature, paralleling Romanticism's validation of intense emotions such as apprehension, fear, horror, terror and awe. Awe in particular&amp;nbsp;– experienced when confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– drew Friedrich's interest, as seen in his idealized portrayals of coasts, forests and craggy mountains. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling&amp;nbsp;– ''die romantische Stimmungslandschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] (2005). ''Beauty &amp; Art, 1750–2000''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 54–56. {{ISBN|0-19-280160-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Citation|last=Beenken|first=Hermann|date=April 1938|title=Caspar David Friedrich|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]]|volume=72|issue=421|pages=171–175|jstor=867281}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works detail a wide range of geographical features, and he used the landscape as an expression of religious [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Academic American Encyclopedia | publisher = Grolier | location = Danbury | year = 1989|page=332 | isbn = 0-7172-2024-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position [[landscape painting]] as a major genre within Western art. His style influenced his contemporary, the Norwegian [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857), and, later, [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901) and many Russian painters, in particular [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (c. 1842–1910) and [[Ivan Shishkin]] (1832–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Suzanne Latt|title=The Relationship of the American Luminists to Caspar David Friedrich|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|year=1964|oclc=23758262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the 18th-century [[Düsseldorf School]] is characterized by finely detailed but still fanciful landscapes, often portraying religious or allegorical stories. Leading members of the Düsseldorf School advocated [[En plein air|plein-air]] painting and tended to use a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] of relatively subdued and muted colors. The Düsseldorf School grew out of, and was a part of, the [[Germany|German]] [[Romantic movement]]. Prominent members of the Düsselorf School included [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], [[Rudolf Koller]], [[Karl Friedrich Lessing]], [[Johann Wilhelm Schirmer]], [[Andreas Achenbach]], [[Hans Fredrik Gude]], [[Oswald Achenbach]] and [[Adolf Schrödter]].&lt;ref name="humboldt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Humboldt|first=Wilhelm von|title=Gesammelte Schriften. 1.

French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other artists of the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that in the 19th century would become the most influential in Europe.

It is often assumed that [[plein-air]] painting started with the 19th-century [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], but in fact it was already common in the late 18th century when the members of the [[Hudson River School]] of American [[landscape art|landscape]] painters were already painting in plein-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|title=interview|publisher=jamesgurney.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[I really like the work before 1860 the best. People often assume that plein-air painting started with the Impressionists, but it's much older than that, going back to the late 18th Century. The Hudson River School painters, under the influence of Asher B. Durand, were the first to make a regular practice of it, and they often made more sensitive observations than later plein-air painters, because they weren't influenced by the notion of "art for art's sake." Art does not exist for its own sake. The purpose of art is not to make an aesthetically pleasing picture; it should be much more—to tell a story, reveal a character, convey an emotion, or express some truth about nature.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-landscape.blogspot.se/2010/05/what-is-plein-air-painting.html|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=art-landscape.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frederic Edwin Church]], a central figure in the [[Hudson River School]], was known for painting large landscapes that he saw during his travels to the Arctic and Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart/docs/dma_voyageoftheicebergs|title=Voyage of the Icebergs -online book|publisher=/issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Plein-air painting, in its strictest sense, is the practice of painting landscape pictures out-of-doors; more loosely, the achievement of an intense impression of the open air (French: plein air) in a landscape painting. Until the time of the painters of the Barbizon school in mid-19th-century France, it was normal practice to execute rough sketches of landscape subjects in the open air and produce finished paintings in the studio. Part of this was a matter of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464567/plein-air-painting|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- MORE OF HUDSON SCHOOL AND AMERICANS TO ADD --&gt;

===Impressionists===

The Impressionists were the first artists who made plein-air painting a major genre. They painted outdoors and were interested in real-life subject matter. Their most evident preoccupation and interest was capturing the effect of light and weather at a particular moment&amp;nbsp;– they often painted the same theme all over again in different light and different weather. The Impressionists were influenced in many of their subjects by [[Japanese woodblock prints]]. The themes of falling snow and figures with umbrellas in snow are frequent subjects in the [[ukiyo-e]] Japanese woodblock prints.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter-34290|title=boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter|publisher=www.mfa.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturevulture.net/art-architecture/impressionists-in-winter/|title=impressionists-in-winter|publisher=culturevulture.net|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/monets-garden-melbourne-winter-masterpieces-exhibition|title=Monet’s Garden – Melbourne Winter Masterpieces Exhibition|publisher=www.thecultureconcept.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[During the latter half of the nineteenth century (1874 – 1886) many people found it difficult to cope with this new vision. It was all about capturing the moment, the joy of life and revealing many of its secrets or truths.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a series of severe winters in France also contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] started painting large numbers of winter landscapes in which they experimented with the use of light and color to paint what they called the ''effets de neige'' (the effects of snow). Other painters who painted winter landscapes but less frequently were [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. The French master [[Claude Monet]]'s first painting in his winter series of 140 paintings was ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at [[Honfleur]]'', which was followed by many other winter landscapes, including a long series with haystacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/claude-monet-paintings-1889-18948.htm|title=claude-monet-paintings-1889|publisher=entertainment.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting ''Boulevard Saint Denis'', Monet sought to catch the moment when the sun was hidden behind the clouds during a light snowfall.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"/&gt; In ''[[The Magpie (Monet)|The Magpie]]'', Monet's largest and probably most widely known winter painting, he used blue-gray colors to depict shadows in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claude-monet.com/the-magpie.jsp|title=the-magpie|publisher=www.claude-monet.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zucapaca.com/best-of-monet/claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie/|title=claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie|publisher=www.zucapaca.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the natural outdoor light that made the Impressionist's treatment of subjects different. They closely observed the various colors of light that were reflected from objects and captured those colors in their paintings. Since Impressionists painted in ''[[plein air]]'', the shadows reflected the light of the sky as it was reflected onto surfaces.

Impressionists generally used vivid colors, with often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter. The new technology of premixed paints in tin tubes aided the development of this style.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters had made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process]. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1860s, many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available such as [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]] and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], as well as even newer colors such as [[cerulean blue]].&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995).

As a result, the Impressionists soon moved toward a brighter style of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stoner, J.H. |author2=Rushfield, R. |year=2013 |title=Conservation of Easel Paintings |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn=9781136000416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, [[Monet]], [[Renoir]], and [[Pissarro]] usually chose to paint on grounds of a light grey or beige colour, but some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356|title=Impressionists|publisher=/yalepress.yale.edu|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. 

=== Sculpture ===
[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Studio Club]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm'' by Clint B.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

[[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N.

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] listed 307 women environmental artists, such as [[Marina DeBris]], [[Vernita Nemec]] and [[Betty Beaumont]]. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=Our Town, Central|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/-145278-ocprint--.html|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to educate children about beach trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OC... and Sculpture by the Sea!|url=http://www.sutherland-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/oc-by-the-sea|publisher=Sutherland Public School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernita Nemec Segments of Endless Junkmail|url=http://artdaily.com/news/19141/Vernita-Nemec-Segments-of-Endless-Junkmail|publisher=Artdaily.org, The First Art Newspaper on the Net|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni Awards|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/alumni-friends/distinguished-alumni-award/alumni-2006/|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Camouflaged Cells Betty Beaumont|journal=Newfound Journal|date=Winter 2011|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.newfoundjournal.org/archives/volume-2/issue-1/photography-beaumont/|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation in art history==
[[Image:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith Leyster]], ''Self-portrait'', 1630, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
[[Image:Villers Young Woman Drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Marie-Denise Villers]], ''Young Woman Drawing'' 1801, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S. Barnes]]: [[South Brunswick, New Jersey]], and [[New York City|New York]], 1968) {{ISBN|1-125-32317-5}} [A second edition of this book was published in July 1969 (Yoseloff: [[London]], {{ISBN|0-498-06974-5}}; also {{ISBN|978-0-498-06974-1}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like this create a discontinuity of identity for women artists.
* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by [[Judith Leyster]] (1630) that were reassigned to [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. "Judith Leyster," ''Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'' vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190–198; 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofrichter, Frima Fox. "Judith Leyster: Leading Star," ''Judith Leyster: A Dutch Master and Her World'', (Yale University, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;Molenaer, Judith.

Accessed Feb. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Denise Villers]] (1774–1821) was a French painter who specialized in [[portrait]]s. Villers was a student of the French painter [[Girodet]]. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.

An '''écorché''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔʁʃe}}) is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin, normally as a [[figure study]] for another work or as an exercise for a student artist. The [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-era [[Renaissance architecture|architect]], theorist and all-around [[Renaissance man]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], recommended that when painters intend to depict a [[Nude (art)|nude]], they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.&lt;ref name="artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/E.html Écorché] defined at ArtLex.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first well known [[Study (art)|studies]] of this kind were performed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who dissected [[cadavers]] and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as [[ancient Greece]], though the specifics are not known.

==Etymology==
The term ''écorché'', meaning literally "[[Flaying|flayed]]", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the [[École des Beaux Arts]]) in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="artlex" /&gt;

==History==
Although there are some accounts of practices similar to ''écorché'' as far back as [[ancient Greece]], the degree of similarity is unclear.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the [[Renaissance period]] onwards.

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn’t until the election of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation.&lt;ref name="lemire m"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=M|title=Representation of the human body: the colored wax anatomic models of the 18th and 19th centuries in the revival of medical instruction|journal=Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy|date=1 December 1992|volume=14|issue=4|pages=283–291|doi=10.1007/BF01794751|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01794751?LI=true|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginn|first=Sheryl R.|author2=Lorusso, Lorenzo|title=Brain, Mind, and Body: Interactions with Art in Renaissance Italy|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|date=16 July 2008 |volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–313|doi=10.1080/09647040701575900|pmid=18629698|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/0964704x/v17i0003/295_bmabiwairi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andreas Vesalius]], two of the most influential artists in [[anatomical illustrations]].&lt;ref name=specbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Martin Kemp, Marina|title=Spectacular bodies : the art and science of the human body from Leonardo to now|year=2001|publisher=[[Hayward Gallery]]|location=London|isbn=0520227921|pages=22–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the “artist-anatomist” for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to [[anatomy]].  Leonardo’s anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body.&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keele|first=Kenneth D.|title=Leonardo Da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy|journal=Medical History|date=October 1964|volume=8|issue=4|pages=360–370|doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835|pmid=14230140|pmc=1033412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections.&lt;ref name=specbook /&gt;  Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The ''écorché'' (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale écorché figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed.&lt;ref name=healthcare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Harry|title=Early Use of Simulation in Medical Education|journal=[[Society for Simulation in Healthcare|Simulation in Healthcare: the Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare]]|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=102–116|doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e3182415a91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Écorché'' figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating écorché statues. The production of colored wax anatomies allowed for a variety of hues and tone that makes the models appear realistic.&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite journal|last=DARLINGTON|first=ANNE|title=The Teaching of Anatomy and the Royal Academy of Arts 1768-1782|journal=Journal of Art &amp; Design Education|date=1 December 1986|volume=5|issue=3|pages=263–271|doi=10.1111/j.1476-8070.1986.tb00207.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The ''écorché'' form of study still continues at traditional schools throughout the world including the [[New York Academy of Art]], the [[Art Students League of New York]], the [[Grand Central Academy of Art]] in New York City, the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, and the [[Academy of Art University|Academy of Art University in San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.academyart.edu/content/dam/assets/pdf/arc/handouts/FA-FASCU-JEM.pdf |title = Academy of Art University On Campus Labs |date = |accessdate = 23 November 2016 |website = academyart.edu |publisher = [[Academy of Art University]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
