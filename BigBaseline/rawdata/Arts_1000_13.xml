'''Actual Art''' is a genre of art that was first named by critic [[Alfred Frankenstein]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' in a review of [[Helene Aylon]]’s work.  The name was chosen because the art was "real", but the term ''[[Realism (arts)|realism]]'' was already in use.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"&gt;[Frankenstein, Alfred. San Francisco Chronicle, "NY, Helene Aylon" September 28, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenstein described Aylon's work as a genre of art that involves “the self-conscious enlistment of the forces of nature, by artists, toward the completion of their art”.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"/&gt; Collaboration with nature necessarily brings the dimension of time into as an integral component of the artworks, with some requiring many thousands of years for their completion. The artists consider the future of the work to be as important as its present, relinquishing control over the work to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Fugate-Wilcox's deliberate yielding to the forces over which he has no control measures his awareness of the power of nature." Jonathon Goodman, ''Art in America'' (Dec. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- [[Image:Redspot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Red Spot" painting of 21st century material; a paint that never dries, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] --&gt;

==History==
In 1982, the Actual Art Foundation formed in the [[Tribeca]] district of New York City to promote exclusively artists working in the Actual Art genre, and in 1985, obtained its 501-C3 not-for-profit tax-exempt status to fund exhibitions of Actual Art and projects proposed by Actual Artists.  The most notable early exhibitions sponsored by the Actual Art Foundation were:

* "It's About Time" at the New York City Gallery in 1983
* "Time Will Tell" at Squibb International, Princeton, NJ in 1984
* "Slow Kinetic Art" at the Wadsworth Athenium, Hartfortd, CT
* "Time Waits..." co-sponsored with [[Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis]] and his wife [[Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis|Gloria]] at [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|Schloss St. Emmeram]] in [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

The "Time Will Tell" exhibit was documented in articles appearing in the ''New York Times'', the ''Bergen County Record'', the ''Princeton Packet'', and the ''Trentonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Cook, "Actual Exhibit at Squibb", ''Trentonian'', June 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of Actual Art Foundation was also used for an episode of Law &amp; Order circa 1990, featuring Actual Art. Actual Art Foundation lost its Tribeca headquarters in the attacks of [[9/11]] and created an Art Center at Candlewood Lake in Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
In Actual Art, what future generations will see is programmed into the work, making time an element of the work, as well as space, form or color. The artists introduce time as a tool in the making of art. Actual Art is about energy; specifically, about the energy and life in the materials. Words like “decay”, “deterioration” or “destruction” are replaced with “change”.&lt;ref&gt;[Weiss, Paulette. "Actual Art at Fulcrum Gallery" '''Where Magazine''', July 1997 illust]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] is quoted as saying, “The work will last forever, as long as you understand it changes.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Lancion, “Contrarian Gallery gains Cultural Leverage”, ''Craine’s Small Business'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Art moves one to think about ways to work with nature instead of fighting it. In place of the constant attempts to inhibit materials’ natural tendency to change (to the detriment of the planet), man might be examining and exploiting the inherent qualities of the materials we work with. Actual Artists have a visionary sense of the natural order of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;[Randell, Susan '''Manhattan Arts International'''  June-Aug, 1994 pg. 6, Illust]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cool==

In ''African Art in Motion'', African art scholar and [[Yale]] professor [[Robert Farris Thompson]] turns his attention to cool in both the African and [[African-American]] contexts:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mind of an elder within the body of the young is suggested by the striking African custom of dancing "hot" with a "cool" unsmiling face. This quality seems to have haunted [[Ten Rhyne]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 1673 and it struck the imagination of an early observer of strongly African-influenced dancing in [[Louisiana]] in the early nineteenth century, who noted "thumping ecstasy" and "intense solemnity of mien." The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history:  
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is interesting that what remains a spiritual principle in some parts of Africa and the rare African-influenced portions of the modern U.S.A., such as [[Tidelands|tidewater]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], becomes in the mainline [[African American|Afro-American]] urban culture an element of contemporary street behavior:
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Negro]] boys…have a 'cool' way of walking in which the upper trunk and pelvis rock fore and aft while the head remains stable with the eyes looking straight ahead. The…walk is quite slow, and the Negroes take it as a way of 'strutting' or 'showing off'....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
The cool style of male walking in the United States is called ''bopping'' ...  Mystical coolness in Africa has changed in urban African-American assertions of independent power. But the functions, to heal and gather strength, partially remain. And the name ''cool'' [''kule''], remains. And the body is still played in two patterns, one stable, the other active, part energy and part mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson|first=Robert Farris |authorlink=Robert Farris Thompson| title=African Art in Motion |year=1974 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02703-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Anamorphosis''' is a distorted projection or perspective requiring the viewer to use special devices or occupy a specific vantage point (or both) to view a recognizable image. Some of the media it is used in are painting, photography, sculpture and installation, toys, and film special effects.  The word "anamorphosis" is derived from the Greek prefix ''ana&amp;#8209;'', meaning "back" or "again", and the word ''morphe'', meaning "shape" or "form". An optical anamorphism is the visualization of a mathematical operation called an [[affine transformation]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez-Reyes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sánchez-Reyes|first1=Javier|last2=Chacón|first2=Jesús M.|title=Anamorphic Free-Form Deformation|journal=Computer Aided Geometric Design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839616300826 |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |pages=30–42|doi=10.1016/j.cagd.2016.06.002|date=August 1, 2016|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extreme anamorphosis has been used by artists to disguise [[caricature]]s, [[erotic]] and [[scatological]] scenes, and other furtive images from a casual viewer, while revealing an undistorted image to the knowledgeable spectator.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Daniel L. |title=Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer: History, Technique and Current Practice |journal=Leonardo |date=1992 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179 |doi=10.2307/1575710|jstor=1575710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of projection==
[[File:Anamorphosis chair.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of mirror anamorphosis]]

There are two main types of anamorphosis: ''perspective'' (oblique) and ''mirror'' (catoptric). More-complex anamorphoses can be devised using distorted lenses, mirrors, or other optical transformations.

Examples of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival]] anamorphosis date to the early [[Renaissance]] (fifteenth century).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977" /&gt; Examples of mirror anamorphosis were first seen in the late Renaissance (sixteenth century).

With mirror anamorphosis, a conical or cylindrical [[mirror]] is placed on the drawing or painting to transform a flat distorted image into an apparently undistorted picture that can be viewed from many angles. The deformed image is painted on a plane surface surrounding the mirror. By looking into the mirror, a viewer can see the image undeformed.

With ''Channel anamorphosis'' or ''[[turning picture]]s'' two different images are on different sides of a corrugated carrier. A straight frontal view shows an unclear mix of the images, while each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle.

==History==
===Early Use of Distorted Perspective===
The prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]] may make use of anamorphic technique, because the oblique angles of the cave would otherwise result in distorted figures from a viewer's perspective.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The ancient historians [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Tzetzes]] both record a sculpture competition between [[Alcamenes]] and [[Phidias]] to create an image of [[Minerva]]. Alcamenes' sculpture was beautiful, while Phidias' had grotesque proportions. Yet once both had been mounted on pillars, the decelerated perspective made Phidias' Minerva beautiful and Alcamenes' ugly.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=7-8}}

===Renaissance===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' with a ''[[memento mori]]'' anamorph skull in the foreground, 1533 ]]

[[File:Holbein Skull.jpg|thumb|Viewed from the correct oblique angle, the diagonal in ''The Ambassadors'' transforms into an undistorted ''memento mori''.]]

During the Renaissance, artists' experimentation with optics and perspective lead to more advanced development of anamorphic imagery. At this time, religious thought and science were equally important to the technique's growth in Europe. {{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=70}} The earliest known example, known as ''Leonardo's Eye'', was executed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is included in the ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (1483-1518). He later completed several large-scale anamorphic commissions for the King of France. [[Vignolo]] credited [[Tommasso Lauretti]] as the originator of a perspectival anamorphic technique in one of the earliest written descriptions in ''Two Rules'', compiled between 1530 and 1540 but not published until 1583. Without access to Vignolo's work, many other descriptions and examples were created before 1583.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=29-30,32-33}}

''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' (c. 1533) by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] is well known for the prominent oblique anamorphic transformation in the painting. In this artwork, a distorted shape lies diagonally across the bottom of the frame. Viewing this from an acute angle transforms it into the plastic image of a [[human skull]]. The painting is regarded as a ''[[vanitas]]'' - a meditation on the transience of life - with the skull a symbolic ''[[memento mori]]''. The altered perspective required to see the image reflects the contemporary practice of painting skulls on the reverse of otherwise tranquil paintings.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|chapter=7 Holbein's 'The Ambassadors'}} Four centuries later, the painting inspired the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jaques Lacan]] to note in ‘Of the Gaze as ''Objet Petit a''’ (1973) that the use of anamorphism, particularly in this painting, is one of the few methods for making viewers aware of their gaze.&lt;ref name="Scott DS Project"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Maria |title=Deciphering the Gaze in Lacan's 'Of the Gaze as Objet Petit {{!}} The DS Project |url=http://thedsproject.com/portfolio/deciphering-the-gaze-in-lacans-of-the-gaze-as-objet-petit-a/ |website=The DS Project |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a revival of fantastical anamorphic imagery occurred.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}} Mirror anamorphosis emerged at this time in Italy and China. It remains uncertain whether Jesuit missionaries imported or exported the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |jstor= 3049875|title= Review: Anamorphic Act by Jurgis Baltrušaitis |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major works on perspective were published: ''Perspective''(1612) by [[Salomon de Caus]], and ''Curious Perspective'' (1638) by [[Jean-Francois Niceron]]. Each contained extensive  scientific and practical infromation on anamorphic imagery. In Niceron's work, three types of large-scale anamorphism are explained: 'optical' (looking horizontally); 'anoptric' (looking upwards); and 'catoptric' (looking down ie. from a mezzanine). A conical perspective is also described.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}}

[[File:Sant'Ignazio - affresco soffitto -antmoose.jpg |thumb|[[Andrea Pozzo]]'s painted ceiling in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of St. Ignazio]], 1690]]
[[Baroque]] ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' murals often used anamorphism to combine actual architectural elements with illusory painted elements to create a seamless effect when viewed  from a specific location. The dome and vault of the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of St. Ignazio]] in Rome, painted by [[Andrea Pozzo]], represented the pinnacle of illusion. Due to neighboring monks complaining about blocked light, Pozzo was commissioned to paint the ceiling to look like the inside of a dome, instead of building a real dome. As the ceiling is flat, there is only one spot where the illusion is perfect and a dome looks undistorted.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Anamorphosis could be used to conceal images for privacy or personal safety, and many secret portraits were created of deposed royalty. A well-known anamorphic portrait of the English [[King Edward VI]] was completed a year before his execution in 1546, only visible when viewed through a hole in the frame. It was later hung at [[Whitehall Palace]], and may have influenced [[Shakespeare]] during the writing of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=16-18}} Many anamorphic portraits of [[King Charles I]] were created and shared following his 1649 execution.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=28}}  A secret mirror anamorphosis portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] can only be recognized when a polished cylinder is placed in the correct position. To possess such an image would have been seen as [[treason]] in the aftermath of the 1746 [[Battle of Culloden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhighlandmuseum.org.uk/collections/the-jacobites/secret-portrait/ |title=Now you see me  |publisher=[[West Highland Museum]] |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth Century===
[[File:Thomas-Mole-Living Emblem-1919-USMC.jpg|thumb|Thomas and Mole, ''Living Emblem'' (1919). USMC]]
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, anamorphic images had come to be used more as [[children's games]] than fine art.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; By the twentieth century, some artists wanted to renew the technique of anamorphosis for aesthetic and conceptual effect. During the First World War [[Arthur Mole]], an American commercial photographer, used anamorphic techniques to create patriotic images from massive assembled groups of soldiers and reservists. When seen from high above, the gathered people resolved into recognizable pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Radio |first1=Minnesota Public |title=MPR: Group setting |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/28_robertsc_grouppix/ |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=news.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=28 January 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Duchamp]] was interested in anamorphosis. His last work ''[[Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas]]'' (1946-66) used mild anamorphosis to force viewers into the position of peep-hole voyeurs in order to see a nude, anonymous human body.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]] used extreme [[foreshortening]] and anamorphism in his paintings and works, and had a [[glass floor]] installed in a room next to his studio to enable radical perspective studies from above and below.&lt;ref name=GlassFloor&gt;{{cite book|last=Ades|first=ed. by Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 - March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 - June 18, 2000 ; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 - October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ.

==Impossible objects==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|Necker cube]]
In the twentieth century, artists began to play with perspective by drawing "impossible objects". These objects included stairs that always ascend, or cubes where the back meets the front. Such works were popularized by the artist [[M. C. Escher]] and the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]]. Although referred to as "impossible objects", such objects as the [[Necker Cube]] and the [[Penrose triangle]] can be sculpted in 3-D by using anamorphic illusion. When viewed at a certain angle, such sculptures appear as the so-called impossible objects.

==Ames Rooms==
[[File:Ames room forced perspective.jpg|thumb|Ames room forced perspective]]
[[File:Ames room.JPG|thumb|Ames room]]
The [[Ames room]] was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames]], Jr. in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed through a peephole, the room appears to have normal perspective. However, all other viewpoints reveal that the room is constructed of irregular trapezoids. Similar effects had been achieved during the Renaissance through the use of "accelerated perspective" in stage design. These included productions by Scamozzi (1588-9), Furtenbach (1625), Sabbattini (1637) and Troili (1672).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most interesting effects of an Ames room is that the distorted perspective can make people and objects looks much bigger or smaller than they really are.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anamorphosis art |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/anamorphosis-art |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Ames rooms are widely used in cinema for [[practical special effects]]. A well-known example is the homes in the Shire from the [[Lord of The Rings (film franchise)|Lord of the Rings]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]] films. Through the use of [[forced perspective]], the character of Gandalf appeared much larger than the characters of Frodo and Bilbo, without the use of digital effects.&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=England |first1=Jason |title=Hobbit houses and the Moon trick the brain and eye {{!}} Cosmos |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/hobbit-houses-and-moon-trick-brain-and-eye |website=cosmosmagazine.com |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==
[[Cinemascope]], [[Panavision]], [[Technirama]], and other [[widescreen]] formats use anamorphosis to project a wider image from a narrower film frame. The [[IMAX]] company uses even more extreme anamorphic transformations to project moving images from a flat film frame onto the inside of a [[sphere|hemispheric]] dome, in its "Omnimax" or "IMAX Dome" process.
 
The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very flat angle on roadways, such as "Bus Lane" or "Children Crossing", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 3B.20 Pavement Word, Symbol, and Arrow Markings|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part3/part3b.htm#section3B20|work=[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]|publisher=United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in [[Rugby football]] in [[Australia]], it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play.

Much writing on shop windows is in principle anamorphic, as it was written mirror-reversed on the inside of the window glass.

==In the work of contemporary artists==
[[File:Manfred Stader Stocznia Szczecinska 1 (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic street art by [[Manfred Stader]]]]
While not a widespread in contemporary art, anamorphosis as a technique has been used by contemporary artists in painting, photography,  [[printmaking]], sculpture, film and video, digital art and games, [[holography]],&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; [[street art]] and [[Installation art|installation]]. The latter two art forms are largely practised in public areas such as parks, city centres and transit stations&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=SA |title=Perspective Puzzle: Anamorphic Art in the Toronto Subway |url=https://weburbanist.com/2010/05/08/perspective-puzzle-anamorphic-art-in-the-toronto-subway/ |website=WebUrbanist |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1975 a major exhibition was held focusing exclusively on anamorphic imagery - ''Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art''. The artist [[Jan Beutener]] created ''The Room'' - a major new installation - specifically for the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

The ''Presence of Absence'' is an ongoing exhibition focusing on anamorphic art. It features work by [[Patrick Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Sculpture and Installation===
[[File:West Bromwich Bus Station - sign and mosaic's (5580214957).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic mosaic art in a [[West Bromwich]] bus station.]]

Since the mid-20th century, many artists have made use of anamorphosis in public artworks. American [[Land art]] pioneer [[Michael Heizer|Michael Heizer's]] ''Complex One'' (1972-1974), a massive earth and concrete structure in the [[Nevada]] desert, creates a rectangular frame for a [[mastaba]] when viewed from a specific location.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; Inspired by [[Luxor]] and other ancient monumental sites, it is part of the larger work ''City'', an enormous sculpture running a mile and a half long. The entire work will not be completed until 2020.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodyear |first1=Dana |title=A Monument to Outlast Humanity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Marcus Raetz]] created anamorphic sculptures ranging in size from large-scale public installation to something that could fit in your hand. One of his largest pieces, ''Kopf'', revealed the form of a person's head in profile when viewed from a specific vantage-point. It was installed in a public park in [[Basel, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Shigeo Fukuda]], a Japanese artist and designer globally renowned for his satirical posters on anti-war and environmental advocacy&lt;ref name="NYT Fukuda"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heller |first1=Steven |title=Shigeo Fukuda, Graphic Designer of Wit and Allusion, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/design/20fukuda.html |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=19 January 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, created posters and sculptures making use of both types of anamorphosis in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="illusionworks Fukada"&gt;{{cite web |title=Art of Shigeo Fukada |url=https://psy2.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/art_of_shigeo_fukuda.html |publisher=Illusionworks |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote multiple books on the topic of optical illusions.

While anamorphic images were not his exclusive area of focus, the American artist [[Jonathan Borofsky]] created installations in the 1980's using anamorphic techniques, exhibiting at institutions such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; 

[[File:Fréhel vue d'ensemble 1.jpg|thumb|Jean-Max Albert, ''Un carré pour un square'', from the specific vantage point, Place Fréhel, Paris(1988)]]
[[Jean-Max Albert]] created three public sculptures using anamorphosis:''Un carré pour un square'', ''Cube fantôme'' and ''Reflet anamorphose'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jonty Hurwitz]], pioneered the use of a mathematical technique to create [[Catoptrics|Catoptric]] sculptures that resolve in a cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Jobson|date=January 21, 2013|website=Colossal|title=The Skewed, Anamorphic Sculptures and Engineered Illusions of Jonty Hurwitz|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he produced a public work for the [[Savoy Hotel]]'s River Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alice Jones|title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html|date=May 2, 2013|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Several academic papers have been written about his work, notably, *''A simplified procedure for anamorphic sculpture'', 2015.

In 2011, French artist [[François Abélanet]]'s anamorphic garden work ''Qui croire? (Who to believe?)'' was featured in front of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Adams|first=Henry|title=Is a "Garden" the World's Greatest New Artwork?|date=Nov 29, 2011|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/art/2011/11/is-a-garden-the-worlds-greatest-new-artwork/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Varini|Felici Varini's]] 2014 work ''Three Ellipses for Three Locks'' in [[Hasselt, Belgium]] is an image of three loops that are  made up of segments painted on to over 100 buildings. It is only visible from a specific vantage point over the city.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis" /&gt;

===Drawing and Painting===
The Swedish artist Hans Hamngren produced and exhibited many examples of mirror anamorphosis in the 1960s and 1970s. 

===Photography===
Beginning in 1967, Dutch artist [[Jan Dibbets]] based an entire series of photographic work titled ''Perspective Corrections'' on the distortion of reality through perspective anamorphosis. This involved the incorporation of land art into his work, where areas dug out of the Earth formed squares from specific perspectives.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Street Art===
Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called "Slant Art" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the [[sidewalk chalk]] drawings of [[Kurt Wenner]] and [[Julian Beever]]&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist" /&gt;, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time.

In 2016, the street artist [[JR (artist)|JR]] completed a massive temporary anamorphic illusion over the [[Louvre|Louvre's]] pyramid, making the modern structure disappear and the original building appear as though it was still in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="JR 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=JR completes monumental anamorphic artwork on the louvre's glass pyramid |url=https://www.designboom.com/art/jr-louvre-museum-installation-paris-05-24-2016/ |website=designboom architecture &amp; design magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">The '''Anglo-French Art Centre''' (or '''Anglo-French Art School''', previously the [[St John's Wood Art School]], was an [[art school]] in [[St John's Wood]], north [[London]], England.

The original St John's Wood Art School dated from 1878.&lt;ref name="isaaman"&gt;{{cite web| title=Feature: Exhibition- Rediscovery of a chapter in London's art history — St John’s Wood Art School and The Anglo-French Art Centre — Boundary Gallery | url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/feature-exhibition-rediscovery-chapter-londons-art-history-st-john%E2%80%99s-wood-art-school-and-anglo-frenc | date=11 November 2010

The centre was founded by [[Alfred Rozelaar Green]], who studied in [[Paris]] at the [[Académie Julian]] and Atelier Gromaire before the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Anglo-French Art Centre | url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/schools/anglo-french-art-centre | publisher=Art Biographies, UK | accessdate=21 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to London at the end of the war. Afterwards in 1946, Green established the centre at 29 Elm Tree Road in St John's Wood. Green aimed to revolutionise British [[art education]]. He invited artists from [[France]] and other countries to exhibit and teach. Artists included [[Robert Couturier (1905–2008)|Robert Couturier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jean Lurçat]], Agnès Capri and [[Germaine Richier]]. He was also supported by English artists who visited to give lectures, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Julian Trevelyan]]. Other lecturers included [[art critic]]s and [[museum director]]s. The centre closed in 1951.&lt;ref name="isaaman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">An '''animation director''' is the [[Film director|director]] in charge of all aspects of the [[animation]] process during the production of an animated film or an animated segment for a [[Live action|live action film]] or television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Walt Disney, the Art of Animation: The Story of the Disney Studio Contribution to a New Art | first=Bob | last=Thomas | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1958 | page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
This may include directing the [[storyboard]], character design, background animation, and other aspects of animation. Some animated film productions may split the duties between an animation director, who focuses on the creation of the animation, and a director who oversees all other aspects of the film. A supervising animator is commonly in charge of all aspects of the design and artwork for a single major character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Character animation in depth | first=Doug | last=Kelly | publisher= Creative Professionals Press | year=1998 | page=38 | ISBN=9781566047715}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supervising animator oversees a group of [[Animator|animators]] who complete the entire scenes in which a particular character appears.

The day-to-day responsibilities of an animation director may include checking and updating lists for each scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">The '''Art dans Tout''' movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Felix Aubert, Art dans Tout, and Art Nouveau Lace|jstor = 40662780|journal = Studies in the Decorative Arts|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 37–76|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = ROSSELLA|last = FROISSART-PEZONE|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wittman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer [[Félix Aubert]], sculptor and craftsman [[Alexandre Charpentier]], sculptor and medalist [[Jean Dampt]], sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect [[Charles Plumet]], it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter [[Étienne Moreau-Nélaton]] and architect and decorator [[Tony Selmersheim]]. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: A Research Guide for Design Reform in France, Belgium, England, and the United States|last = Weisberg|first = Gabriel P.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 184, 238|last2 = Menon|first2 = Elizabeth K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Desbois, a sculptor, [[Paul Follot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ketterer Kunst,  Art auctions, Book auctions Munich, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|url = http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/paul-follot-1877.php|website = www.kettererkunst.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, [[Henri Sauvage]], an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.&lt;ref name="Arwas"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: The French Aesthetic|last = Arwas|first = Victor|publisher = Papadakis Publisher|year = 2002|isbn = 9781901092370|location = |pages = 321, 616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

With the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc]]. Followers of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'ART DANS TOUT - Les arts décoratifs en France et l'utopie d'un Art nouveau|last=Froissart Pezone|first=Rossella|publisher=CNRS Éditions|year=2005|isbn=9782271062819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Décoration &amp; Le Rationalisme Architecturaux a L'Exposition Universelle|last = Clausen|first = M. L.|publisher = Brill Archive|year = 1987|isbn = 9789004078796|location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Les Cinq ==
Les Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Les Six ==
In December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.

== Art dans Tout ==
The group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-group activities ==

Although the group disbanded in 1901 due to financial issues, and an inability to convince major furniture manufacturers to use their designs, several group members continued to collaborate, notably Plumet and Selmersheim.&lt;ref name="Arwas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'utopie de l'art pour tous {{!}} L'Histoire|url = http://www.histoire.presse.fr/actualite/infos/l-utopie-de-l-art-pour-tous-01-06-2005-6471|website = www.histoire.presse.fr|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bastar Wooden Crafts''' are traditional Indian [[wood]]en crafts that are manufactured in the [[Bastar district|Bastar]] district of [[Chhattisgarh]] state, [[India]]. The wood-crafting work has been protected under the [[Geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 84 as "Bastar Wooden Craft" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer [[Leigh Bowery]] titled ''Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon''. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994&amp;ndash;96, and came to call her "Big Sue". He said of her body "It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing".&lt;ref&gt;[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], Exhibition booklet for ''Lucian Freud Portraits'', 2012, Section VII&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

The '''Cretto di Burri''' (crack of Burri) or Cretto di Gibellina (crack of Gibellina), also known as "The Great Cretto", is a landscape artwork which undertaken by [[Alberto Burri]] in 1984 and was left in an unfinished state in 1989 (due to lack of funds),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burricentenario.com/home/iniziative-ed-eventi-del-centenario-di-burri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gibellina.siciliana.it/pages/cretto.html&lt;/ref&gt; based on the old city of [[Gibellina]]. The original city of Gibellina was completely destroyed in the [[1968 Belice earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palinsesti.org/2006/grande-cretto&lt;/ref&gt; Gibellina has since been rebuilt, about 20&amp;nbsp;km from the city's original location.  In 2015 to mark what would have been Burri's one hundredth birthday the work was completed at last.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abitare.it/en/habitat-en/landascape-design-en/2015/11/06/in-gibellina-the-cretto-by-burri-is-finished-after-30-years/?refresh_ce-cp&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is the subject of a short documentary by the Dutch filmmaker Petra Noordkamp which was created as commissioned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] to be screened at the Alberto Burri retrospective held at the institution from October 9, 2015 until January 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://5dutchdaysnyc.org/petra-noordkamp-film-on-il-grande-cretto-di-gibellini/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex''', also known as '''CCP Complex''', is an {{convert|88|ha|adj=on}} owned by The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP) located along [[Roxas Boulevard]] in [[Metro Manila]], Philippines, most of which fall under the jurisdiction of the city of [[Pasay]].&lt;ref group="note" name="Manila Note II"/&gt; 

Development of the complex was stalled until 2000, when the Philippine Supreme Court ruled with finality the CCP's ownership of some {{convert|35|ha}} of prime real estate in the complex. The property is {{convert|62.4|ha}} of land, with the rest being occupied by the [[Government Service Insurance System]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], and the Privatization and Management Office. It is part of [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Bay City]] (formerly Boulevard 2000) that spans {{convert|1500|ha}} of reclaimed land along [[Manila Bay]] which is occupied by the [[SM Prime Holdings|SM]] Central Business Park, [[Philippine National Bank]]'s Financial Center Area, and [[PAGCOR]]'s [[Entertainment City]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/programs-and-projects/reclamation |title=Reclamation |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The complex is bounded by the Manila Bay to the north and west, the [[Philippine Navy]] headquarters to the northeast, Roxas Boulevard to the east, and [[Jose Diokno Boulevard]] to the south. It is divided into two zones: the Art Zone, and the Commercial and Entertainment Zone.&lt;ref name="ccp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pea.gov.ph/13-bay-city/24-cultural-center-of-the-philippines |title=Cultural Center of the Philippines |publisher=Philippine Reclamation Authority |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features several [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] structures designed in the 1960s and 1970s by [[Leandro Locsin]], such as the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]], the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and the [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]]. Other locators in the complex include the [[Coconut Palace]], the [[Manila Film Center]] and [[Star City (amusement park)|Star City]] amusement park.&lt;ref name="ccp"/&gt;

==Buildings==

===Tanghalang Pambansa===
{{Main|Tanghalang Pambansa}}
[[File:Ccp ext 1.jpg|thumb|Façade of the [[Tanghalang Pambansa]]]]
The [[Tanghalang Pambansa]] ({{lang-en|National Theater}}) is the flagship venue and principal offices of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. Formally called the Theater of Performing Arts, it houses three major performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. 

* '''Tanghalang [[Nicanor Abelardo]] (Main Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang [[Aurelio Tolentino]] (Little Theater)'''
* '''Tanghalang Huseng Batute (Studio Theater)'''

Designed by National Artist for Architecture [[Leandro Locsin]], its design was based and expanded upon the unconstructed Philippine-American Friendship Center. The ''Tangahalan'' is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the [[nipa hut]]. Being a work of a National Artist, the [[brutalist]] structure is qualified to be an important cultural landmark as stipulated in Republic Act No. 10066.&lt;ref name="CCPRA10066"&gt;Republic Act No. 10066 "Providing for the protection and conservation of the national cultural heritage, strengthening the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and its affiliated cultural agencies, and for other purposes". Full Text available [http://www.unesconatcom.ph/docs/culture/NatlCulturalHeritage%20Act2009.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanghalang Fransisco Balagtas===
[[File:MetroManilajf9625 23.JPG|thumb|[[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]]]]
{{main|Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas}}
The [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]], more commonly known by its original name of Folk Arts Theater, is a covered [[proscenium]] [[amphitheater]] is where popular concerts are usually staged. It has a seating capacity of 8,458 in ten sections. The building was originally built to seat an audience of 10,000 and was commissioned by then [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] in 1974 for the [[Miss Universe]] Pageant, which was to be held in Manila. The theater was built in record time of seventy-seven days in time for the pageant and was designed by [[Leandro V. Locsin]].

It was host to many popular musical acts of the 1980s onwards, including [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] group [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], British pop group [[5ive]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Gary Valenciano]] and [[Jay R Sillona|Jay R]]. The Folk Arts Theater is also used as a site by different religious groups. [[Day by Day Christian Ministries]], a large international religious organization, has leased the area since 2005. They have dedicated the Theatre as ''Bulwagan ng Panginoón'' ({{lang-en|Hall of the [[Tetragrammaton|Lord]]}}). The building is expected to be torn down in the future, subject to the development of the Complex.

===Other buildings===
[[File:MFCjf0093 35.JPG|thumb|[[Philippine International Convention Center]]]]
The CCP Complex is also home to the following:
* [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (Owned by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|BSP]])
* [[Manila Film Center]] (CCP)
* [[Coconut Palace]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])
* [[Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila]] ([[Government Service Insurance System|GSIS]])

==History==
The Cultural Center of the Philippines was conceived in 1966 when Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing its board and arranging for his wife Imelda to become chair of its Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=CCPLicoEdifice&gt;{{cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerald |title=Edifice Complex: Power, Myth and Marcos State Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location=Quezon City, Philippines |isbn=978-971-550-435-5 |pages=178 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCPSanctuary&gt;{{cite news |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |title=Sanctuary for the Filipino Soul |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/10643/sanctuary-of-the-filipino-soul |accessdate=10 October 2011 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine-American Culture Foundation provided a Ninety Thousand Peso Grant for its construction and additional funds were taken from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edifice complex : power, myth, and Marcos state architecture|last=Gerard.|first=Lico|date=2003|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-9715504355|location=Quezon City|oclc=53371189}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became the premier symbol of what would be called Imelda's [[edifice complex]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Expansion==
A comprehensive master plan for the development of the complex was unveiled in 2003. The plan would divide the CCP Complex into six clusters, each of which will be anchored by a major building. First, the Promenade, which will tentatively be named after Lucresia Reyes-Urtula, will include retail and other mixed-use facilities, as well as dock facilities. The second cluster will be the Arts Sanctuary, which will serve as the complex's cultural core. To be anchored by the Tanghalang Pambansa, it will contain a new performing arts theater, the artists' center, a [[bandstand]], the CCP's Production Design Center, as well as other open areas.

The third cluster, the Green Zone will contain a mix of museums, parks with commercial and office spaces. Fourth, the Creative Hub cluster, containing spaces for creative industries. Fifth, The Arts Living Room, envisioned to be a high-density, high-rise area that will house condominiums and similar residential projects. The final cluster, the Breezeway, will be located by low-rise, low-density commercial structures with seafront entertainment facilities. Covered walkways, plazas, and bicycle lanes are planned to connect the various buildings and clusters to ensure a pedestrian-centered design. The master plan is envisioned to be completed in four phases, from 2004 to 2014; ₱5 billion will be needed for the plan's first five years, and another ₱8 billion for the plan's latter half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=5398 ‘Commercialized’ CCP embraces the poor].

The proposed Performing Arts Theater will contain a 1,000 seat conventional proscenium theater and a black box that will seat 300-500 people.&lt;ref name=CCPDesign1/&gt; In contrast with the ''Tanghalang Pambansa's'' massive travertine block, the façade of the new theater will be dominated by its main seating bowl clad in reflective material, evoking a wave rising out of the sea. On January 19, 2016, construction of a new black box theater started with the aim of eventually integrating the new structure into the proposed Performing Arts Theater. Estimated to cost ₱50 million, the new theater will be three to four times bigger than the Tanghalang Huseng Batute, the current black box facility of the CCP.&lt;ref name="CCPNewBlackbox"&gt;{{cite news |title=After 3 decades–and ‘against all odds’–CCP breaks ground on a new theater |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/221508/after-3-decades-and-against-all-odds-ccp-breaks-ground-on-a-new-theater |accessdate=14 December 2016 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to international organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), '''cultural industries''' (sometimes also known as "[[creative industries]]") combine the creation, production, and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that are [[cultural]] in nature and usually protected by [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;. "Exploring The Cultural and Creative Industries Debate". Culture Action Europe. Retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
The notion of cultural industries generally includes textual, [[music]], [[television]], and [[film]] production and [[publishing]], as well as crafts and design. For some countries, [[architecture]], the visual and [[performing arts]], [[sport]], [[advertising]], and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance.

Cultural industries worldwide have adapted [[To The New]] digital technologies and to the arrival of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global [[oligopoly]].

'''David Franklin''' is an art historian with expertise in Italian Renaissance art, a [[curator]], and a former art museum director.

==Thomson Collection==
David Franklin is employed by the Thomson Collection in Toronto, Ontario. On April 8, 2015, he gave his first public lecture under this affiliation at the National Gallery of Canada's Wednesday Morning Lecture Series, focusing his remarks on Piero de Cosimo's painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beaux-arts.ca/documents/content/Wednesday_Lectures_2014-15.pdf; see his related essay, "Piero di Cosimo and the Painting of his Time," in ''Piero di Cosimo: the Poetry of Painting in Renaissance Florence'', Washington, National Gallery, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin helped plan the Canadian Photography Institute, which has promised gifts from David Thomson and major funding from Bank of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/national-gallery-creates-new-photography-institute-with-aid-from-scotiabank-david-thomson/article27506410/|title=Thomson, Scotiabank team up for new photo institute at National Gallery|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/cpi/|title=Canadian Photography Institute|author=|date=|website=www.Gallery.ca|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an editor of ''The Canadians'' (2016), a selection of photographs from ''The Globe and Mail'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/photography-book-the-canadians-a-kind-of-reimagining-of-the-americans/article31468672/|title=Photography book The Canadians a kind of reimagining of The Americans|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}}

==Cleveland Museum of Art==
Franklin was named director of the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in 2010. While Franklin was Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, a donation of $1,000,000 was made by Leigh Carter in 2013 to the museum's endowment to fund a permanent fellowship to help the museum's director conduct research on special art historical projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/09/former_bf_goodrich_president_l.html|title=Former B.F. Goodrich president Leigh Carter donates $1 million to the Cleveland Museum of Art for research|author=|date=September 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-year tenure, Franklin abruptly resigned on October 21, 2013, citing personal reasons and a need "to do more research and writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_direct_1.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin resigns for personal reasons, effective immediately|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the Cleveland Scene revealed that Franklin (married with two children) had been in a romantic relationship with an employee of the museum. The board of directors at the museum had been made aware of the affair when the employee was found to have apparently committed suicide in her Cleveland Heights apartment, shortly after she and Franklin were supposed to have travelled to Spain together, and one week before they were supposed to travel to Italy. According to police reports, David Franklin called the 911 himself and was the only person present at the scene. When police came to investigate the suspicious death, Franklin lied to the officers, pretending having received a text message from the woman, which, according to the Police, never happened. He claimed to have run to the apartment after receiving this text message and to have discovered the body by entering the apartment through an open door. In the course of the investigation, it became apparent that the employee's digital camera and cell phone were missing. Police have also discovered that a major transfer of data had been done from the woman's phone shortly after she was found dead. As the family could not believe many details of the reported story, a detective was assigned to further investigate the death and Franklin's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/31/david-franklin-lied-to-cleveland-heights-police-the-night-he-found-christina-gastons-body|title=David Franklin Lied to Cleveland Heights Police the Night He Found Christina Gaston's Body|first=Sam|last=Allard|date=October 31, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this revelation came to the attention of the board, Franklin was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_confir.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art confirms that an extramarital affair led to David Franklin's resignation as director|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/23/former-cleveland-museum-of-art-director-david-franklin-resigns-after-affair-suicide-cell-phone-of-victim-missing|title=Former Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin Resigns After Affair, Suicide; Cell Phone of Victim Missing|first=Vince|last=Grzegorek|date=October 23, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Gallery of Canada==
Previously, Franklin served as deputy director of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Litt&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html "David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art"], Steven Litt, August 27, 2010, ''Plain Dealer''.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at the National Gallery of Canada for twelve years, beginning as the curator of prints and eventually rising to the post of deputy director and chief curator. In 2009, the National Gallery of Canada Foundation received a donation from the philanthropists Donald and Beth Sobey for The Donald and Beth Sobey Chief Curator’s Research Endowment. While at the National Gallery, Franklin became involved in a controversy involving the firing of a subordinate. His action of completely removing emails, by deleting emails from his system's trash, was seen as a move to remove evidence of wrongful termination. Franklin denied this. He was removed from his post, and after suing the institution, was restored to his position, before being fired a second time, a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/arts/design/29gall.html|title=Controversy and Court Filings at the National Gallery of Canada|first=Ian|last=Austen|date=December 28, 2008|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=www.NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html|title=David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art|author=|date=August 2010|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - How They Met Themselves (1860-64 circa).jpg|thumb|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], ''How They Met Themselves'', watercolor, 1864|305px]]
A '''doppelgänger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|əl|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|əɹ|,_|-|g|æ|ŋ|əɹ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔpl̩ˌɡɛŋɐ|lang|De-doppelgaenger.ogg}}, literally "double-goer") is a non-biologically related [[look-alike]] or double of a living person, sometimes portrayed as a ghostly or [[paranormal]] phenomenon and usually seen as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an [[evil twin]]. In modern times, the term '''twin stranger''' is occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|title=See what happened when 3 friends set out to find their ‘twin stranger’|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906134813/https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|archivedate=2017-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3994274/Identical-strangers-brought-Finding-Twin-Stranger.html|title=Identical strangers are brought together|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20161202192206/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article%2D3994274/Identical%2Dstrangers%2Dbrought%2DFinding%2DTwin%2DStranger.html|archivedate=2016-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "doppelgänger" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person.

==Spelling==
The word ''doppelgänger'' is a [[loanword]] from the German ''Doppelgänger'', a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns ''Doppel'' (double) and ''Gänger'' (walker or goer).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger Doppelgänger; Orthography, Meaning Synonyms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120074951/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger |date=2012-11-20 }} http://www.duden.de {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AeW56Irr?url=http://www.duden.de/ |date=2012-09-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural "doppelgängers". The first known use, in the slightly different form ''Doppeltgänger'', occurs in the novel ''[[Siebenkäs]]'' (1796) by [[Jean Paul]], in which he explains his [[neologism|newly coined word]] by a [[footnote]] – while actually the word ''Doppelgänger'' also appears, but with a quite different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pleasures of Abandonment: Jean Paul and the Life of Humor |author=Paul Fleming |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-8260-3247-9 |page=126, footnote 13 |quote=In one of the stranger twists of fate in literary history, Jean Paul coins two terms in ''Siebenkäs'', "Doppelgänger" and "Doppeltgänger." The term Jean Paul uses to describe Siebenkäs and Leibgeber is "Doppeltgänger," which he defines in a footnote: "So heißen Leute, die sich selber sehen" ["the name for people who see themselves"] (2, 67). Earlier in ''Siebenkäs'' the neologism "Doppelgänger" also appears for the first time and means something quite different. In a description of the wedding banquet in the first chapter, the food is so delicious and abundant that "not only was one course [''Gang''] served but also a second, a {{italics correction|''Doppelgänger''}}" ["nicht bloß ''ein'' Gang aufgetragen wurde, sondern ein zweiter, ein Doppelgänger"] (2, 42). "Gang" in German has multiple meanings, ranging from a "walk" to the "course" of a meal; according to Jean Paul, when people "see themselves," when one "goes twice," one is a "Doppeltgänger"; when one has a meal of two courses, in which the second doesn't come second but together with the first, this is a "Doppelgänger."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[noun]]s in German, the word is written with an initial [[capital letter]]. ''Doppelgänger'' and ''Doppelgaenger'' are essentially equivalent spellings, and ''Doppelganger'' is different and would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title. It is further common to drop the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut]] on the letter "a", writing (and often pronouncing) "doppelganger".

==Mythology==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. [[Francis Grose]]'s, ''Provincial Glossary'' of 1787 used the term ''[[fetch (folklore)|fetch]]'' instead, defined as the "apparition of a person living." [[Catherine Crowe]]'s book on paranormal phenomena, ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of [[alter ego]]s and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian mythology]], a ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' was a tangible "spirit double" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. ''The Greek Princess'' presents an Egyptian view of the [[Trojan War]] in which a ''ka'' of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. This is depicted in [[Euripides]]' play [[Helen (play)|''Helen'']]. In [[Norse mythology]], a ''[[vardøger]]'' is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In [[Finnish mythology]], this is called having an ''[[etiäinen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ganander, Christfrid.

==Examples==



[[Izaak Walton]] claimed that English [[metaphysical poet]] [[John Donne]] saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Izaak. ''Life of Dr. John Donne.'' Fourth edition, 1675. Cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;

German playwright [[Goethe]] described an experience in his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' in which he and his double passed one another on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Wolfgang von Goethe.'' Translated by John Oxenford. Horizon Press, 1969. This example cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s drama ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' makes reference to a dead child who "met his own image walking in the garden".&lt;ref&gt;''Prometheus Unbound'', lines 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lord Byron]] uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.&lt;ref name="Burwick2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Burwick|title=Playing to the Crowd: London Popular Theatre, 1780-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37065-4|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Devil's Elixir]] (1815), a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. T. A., ''The Devil's Elixers (English Translation)''. London, T. Cadell, Publishers, 1829; url=https://archive.org/details/devilselixirfrom01hoffuoft/page/n3&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s early novels.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' (1846) presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams']] ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Williams, ''Descent into Hell'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Barker]]'s story "Human Remains" in his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of [[Gothic fiction]].

With the advent of [[social media]], there have been several reported cases of people finding their "twin stranger" online, a modern term for a doppelgänger.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/473004/Twin-strangers-meet-plane-men-ginger-beards|title=Man sits next to stranger who looks EXACTLY like him on plane|last=Mitchell|first=Laura|date=2017-05-18|work=Dailystar.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/twin-strangers-the-website-can-find-your-doppelganger-but-you-may-not-be-pleased-with-your-matches-a6714141.html|title=Twin Strangers: The new website can find your doppelganger - but you may not be pleased with your matches|last=Alderson|first=Maggie|date=2015-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513090415/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/twin-strangers-the-website-can-find-your-doppelganger-but-you-may-not-be-pleased-with-your-matches-a6714141.html|archive-date=2017-05-13|dead-url=no|language=en-GB|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twinstrangers.net is a website where users can upload a photo of themselves and [[facial recognition software]] attempts to match them with another user of like appearance.

==Scientific applications==

[[Heautoscopy]] is a [[glossary of psychiatry|term used in psychiatry]] and neurology for the [[hallucination]] of "seeing one's own body at a distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Damas Mora JM, Jenner FA, Eacott SE | title=On heautoscopy or the phenomenon of the double: Case presentation and review of the literature| journal=Br J Med Psychol | year=1980 | volume=53 | pages= 75–83 | pmid=6989391 | issue=1 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.1980.tb02871.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur as a symptom in [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/JNMD86.htm |author=Blackmore S |title=Out-of-Body Experiences in Schizophrenia: A Questionnaire Survey |journal=[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]] |year=1986 |volume=174 |pages=615–619 |doi=10.1097/00005053-198610000-00006 |pmid=3760852 |issue=10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503013427/http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/JNMD86.htm |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[epilepsy]], and is considered a possible explanation for doppelgänger phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, P; Agosti, R; Regard, M; Wieser, H. G; Landis, T (1994). "Heautoscopy, epilepsy, and suicide". Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgergy and Psychiatry 57: 838-839.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on [[eyewitness testimony]]. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Emily O'Hara.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8246">{{nihongo|'''Ero guro nansensu''', frequently shortened to '''ero guro''' or just '''guro''', |エログロ|ero-guro}} is a literary and artistic movement originating c. 1930 in Japan.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;Silverberg, Miriam Rom. “By Way of a Preface: Defining ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense''”. Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture.

The term itself is an example of ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ''ero'' from "ero(tic)", ''guro'' from "gro(tesque)", and ''nansensu'' from "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=William J.|title=Introduction: making sense of ''nansensu''|journal=Japan Forum|date=27 Apr 2009|volume=21|issue=1 (Special Issue: URBAN NONSENSE)|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/09555800902856932|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555800902856932|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ''ero guro'', and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "[[Graphic violence|gore]]"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a "prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages =113–114 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938 | author2 = Reichert, Jim | publisher = Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 | jstor = 3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Buruma"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as "a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind."&lt;ref name="Buruma"/&gt; Its roots go back to artists such as Tsukioka [[Yoshitoshi]], who, besides erotic [[Shunga (art)|shunga]], also produced woodblock prints showing decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|strangled]] her lover to death and [[castration|castrated]] his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro movement and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other like activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html "A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually into film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many [[Japanese horror]] films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''[[Blind Beast]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''[[Strange Circus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japanese pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Well-known guro [[Mangaka|manga artists]] include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Hajime Yamano]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Go Nagai]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Yamamoto Takato]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[Tentacle erotica|tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife|Octopi and shell diver]]'') but became so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

Some [[visual kei]] bands have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, most notably [[Cali Gari]].&lt;ref name="bounce.com"&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13—Visual Kei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173324/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ |date=June 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans assumed their theme was a subgenre of visual kei and linked it with other similar bands.

The 2014 [[Flying Lotus]] album ''[[You're Dead!]]'' prominently featured ero guro artwork from Japanese manga artist [[Shintaro Kago]] on the cover and inner sleeve, with further art being utilised in the accompanying live show. Much of the drawings featured men and women being disfigured and mutilated in unrealistic, hi-tech ways with a significant amount of gore and nudity.

[[File:Blue eyes.JPG|thumb|[[Nazar (amulet)|Nazars]], [[amulet|charms]] used to ward off the evil eye.]]
The '''evil eye''' is a curse or legend  believed to be cast by a malevolent glare, usually given to a person when they are unaware. Many cultures believe that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=C|title=Hypothesis:The Electrophysicological Basis of the Evil Eye Belief|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3537.2010.01020.x|volume=21|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talisman]]s created to protect against the evil eye are also frequently called "evil eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil%20eye |title=Definition for "evil eye" from Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197336/evil-eye |title=evil eye (occult) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea expressed by the term causes many different cultures to pursue protective measures against it. The concept and its significance vary widely among different [[cultural diversity|cultures]], primarily in [[West Asia]]. The idea appears multiple times in [[rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref name=ulmer&gt;{{cite book |title=The evil eye in the Bible and in rabbinic literature |author=Ulmer, Rivka |editor=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=1994 |isbn=0-88125-463-0|page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwB8Hfkjpx0C&amp;pg=PA176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a widely extended belief among many Mediterranean and Asian tribes and cultures. [[Amulet|Charms]] and decorations with eye-like symbols known as [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]], which are used to repel the evil eye, are a common sight across [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], parts of [[North India]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Morocco]], southern [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Levant]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], and [[Mexico]], and have become a popular choice of souvenir with tourists.

==History==
Belief in the evil eye dates back to [[Classical antiquity]]. It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]
Classical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the "power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}

The idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: "What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?".

====Protection from the eye====
The belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', "to cast a spell" (the origin of the English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye. They have been found throughout Europe and into the Middle East from contexts dating from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes? Theoretical and Methodological Approaches to the Study of Dress in Antiquity |place=Boston, MA |publisher=[[American Institute of Archaeology]] |pages=47-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phallic charms were often objects of personal adornment (such as pendants and finger rings), but also appeared as stone carvings on buildings,&lt;ref name='BAR'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Protecting the Troops?

In describing their ability to deflect the Evil Eye, [[Ralph Merrifield]] described the Roman phallic charm as a "kind of lightning conductor for bad luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Merrifield, R. |date=1969 |title=Roman London |place=London |publisher=Cassell |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|right|Tree with nazars in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]].]]
Belief in the evil eye is strongest in [[West Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]], [[Central America]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]], especially the [[Mediterranean region]]; it has also spread to areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the [[Celts|Celtic]] regions, and the [[Americas]], where it was brought by European colonists and West Asian immigrants.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Belief in the evil eye is found in the [[Islam]]ic doctrine, based upon the statement of Prophet [[Muhammad]], "The influence of an evil eye is a fact..." [Sahih Muslim, Book 26, Number 5427].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427 |title=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2007-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903081746/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427#026.5427 |archive-date=2007-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic practices of warding off the evil eye are also commonly practiced by Muslims: rather than directly expressing appreciation of, for example, a child's beauty, it is customary to say ''[[Masha'Allah]]'', that is, "God has willed it", or invoking God's blessings upon the object or person that is being admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=118 |title=Du'a – What to say when in fear of afflicting something or someone with one?s eye |publisher=Makedua.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of beliefs about the evil eye are also found in [[folk religion]], typically revolving around the use of [[amulet]]s or [[talisman]]s as a means of protection.

In the [[Aegean Region]] and other areas where light-colored eyes are relatively rare, people with [[eye color|green eyes]], and especially blue eyes, are thought to bestow the curse, intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Lynn Daniels, et al., eds, ''Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Volume III), p. 1273, Univ. Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, {{ISBN|1-4102-0916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Greece and Turkey amulets against the evil eye take the form of blue eyes, and in the painting by John Phillip, below, we witness the culture-clash experienced by a woman who suspects that the artist's gaze implies that he is looking at her with the evil eye.

Among those who do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because they simply do not believe it, the phrase, "to give someone the evil eye" usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the [[English language]]. Within the broadcasting industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He may sound like a Dalek doing a bad impression of Kenneth Williams, but why DO so many BBC stars want to exterminate Pesto?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063409/He-sound-like-Dalek-doing-bad-impression-Kenneth-Williams-DO-BBC-stars-want-exterminate-Pesto.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective talismans and cures==
[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Hamsa]], a charm made to ward off the evil eye.]]
Attempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of [[amulet|talismans]] in many cultures. As a class, they are called "''apotropaic''" (Greek for "prophylactic" / προφυλακτικός or "protective", literally: "turns away") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.

Disks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].

Known as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncuğu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarlık}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.
[[File:Hotamis Kilim .jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Haç) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: Çengel), both to ward off the evil eye&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;]]

A blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means "five" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.

A [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Haç) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: Çengel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: Göz) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A.

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] are also strong believers in the evil eye. They will usually wear a blue/turquoise bead around a necklace to be protected from the evil eye. Also, they might pinch the [[buttocks]], comparable to Armenians. It is said that people with green or blue eyes are more prone to the evil eye effect. {{Citation needed|reason=What is the source for this statement? Was it racially motivated in any way?

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant.

===In Judaism===
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clay hamsa with an inscription in Hebrew (translates to "good luck")]]
The evil eye is mentioned several times in the classic ''[[Pirkei Avot]] (Ethics of Our Fathers)''. In Chapter II, five disciples of Rabbi [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] give advice on how to follow the good path in life and avoid the bad. [[Rabbi Eliezer]] says an evil eye is worse than a bad friend, a bad neighbor, or an evil heart.

Judaism believes that a "good eye" designates an attitude of good will and kindness towards others. Someone who has this attitude in life will rejoice when his fellow man prospers; he will wish everyone well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Magic_and_the_Supernatural/Practices_and_Beliefs/Amulets/Evil_Eye.shtml |title=Evil Eye in Judaism |publisher=My Jewish Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; An "evil eye" denotes the opposite attitude. A man with "an evil eye" will not only feel no joy but experience actual distress when others prosper, and will rejoice when others suffer. A person of this character represents a great danger to our moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters of the Fathers, Translation &amp; Commentary by Samson Raphael Hirsch, Feldheim Publishers, {{ISBN|0-87306-182-9}} pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] explained that the evil eye is "an example of how one soul may affect another through unseen connections between them. We are all influenced by our environment.... The evil eye is the venomous impact from malignant feelings of jealousy and envy of those around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Observant Jews avoid talking about valuable items they own, good luck that has come to them and, in particular, their children. If any of these are mentioned, the speaker and/or listener will say ''b'li ayin hara'' (Hebrew), meaning "without an evil eye", or ''kein eina hara'' (Yiddish; often shortened to ''kennahara''), "no evil eye". Another way to ward off the evil eye is to spit three times (or pretend to). Romans call this custom "despuere malum," to spit at evil. &lt;ref&gt;Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic. "The Whole Spiel: Funny essays about digital nudniks, seder selfies and chicken soup memories," Incompra Press, {{ISBN|978-0-692-72625-9}} pg. 153 &lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested {{by whom|date=June 2016}} the 10th commandment: "do not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor" is a law against bestowing the evil eye on another person.

In [[Pakistan]], the evil eye is called ''Nazar'' (نظر). People usually may resort to reading the last three chapters of the Quran, namely [[Al-Ikhlas|Sura Ikhlas]], [[Al-Falaq|Sura Al-Falaq]] and [[Al-Nas|Sura Al-Nas]]. "[[Masha'Allah]]" ({{rtl-lang|ar|ما شاء الله}}) ("God has willed it") is commonly said to ward off the evil eye. Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use "[[taawiz]]" to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ghilzai, S.A., and Kanwal, A.

===Greece===
The evil eye, known as {{lang|el|μάτι}} (''mati''), "eye", as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] visual device, is known to have been a fixture in Greece dating back to at least the 6th century BC, when it commonly appeared on drinking vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster. ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|ξεμάτιασμα}}), whereby the "healer" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it." [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and "healer" then start yawning profusely. The "healer" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].

Another "test" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the "healer" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.

There is another form of the "test" where the "healer" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be λόγια - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying φτου να μη σε ματιάξω! which translates to "I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye." Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.

The [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|βασκανία}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|Μέγαν Ιερόν Συνέκδημον}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}

===Italy===
[[File:Fig._81_-_The_Evil_Eye_-_Elworthy.jpg|thumb|left|Various evil eye amulets from Italy such as the [[cornicello]], [[cimaruta]], and [[lunula (amulet)|lunula]] (1895).]]
The [[cornicello]], "little horn", also called the ''cornetto'' ("little horn", plural ''cornetti''), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African [[Taurotragus|eland]] or a chili pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Corno (Italian Horn Amulet)|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/corno.html|author=Lucky Mojo|access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea that the [[ribaldry|ribald]] suggestions made by sexual [[symbol]]s distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, [[statue]]s of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans. In [[Latin America]], carvings of the fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers continue to be carried as good luck charms.

The wielder of the evil eye, the ''jettatore'', is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his black eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. [[Pope Pius IX]] was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence. ''The Evil Eye''. New York: Columbia UP, 1976. p. 29. {{ISBN|0-231-04006-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
The symbol of the eye, known as "l-għajn", is common on traditional fishing boats which are known as [[luzzu]]. They are said to protect fishermen from storms and malicious intentions. &lt;ref&gt; {{ siteweb | url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/il-qoxra-tradizzjona-traa-traditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineali-li-kulma-tmur-qed-tonqos/
}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Latin America===
The evil eye or 'Mal de Ojo' has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.

In [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye (see ''mal de ojo'', above) and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.

One traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnografía Clásica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Flórez, Franz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Brazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' ("act of giving a bad look") or ''olho gordo'' ("fat eye" i.e. "gluttonous eye") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.

Unlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. "Pagans" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.

Nevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.

Amulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ninguém-pode'' ("against-me-nobody-cans"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-são-jorge'' ("St. George's sword"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guiné'' ("Guinea"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to "sanitize" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' ("seven [lucky] herbs") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjericão'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conheça o poder e a proteção das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)
Other popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Mal ojo often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: "Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&amp;nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the "hot" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, "the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations."&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Nazar Battu}}
In the northern states of India, like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called "Drishti" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: "buri nazar wale tera muh kala" ("O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black").

In general in India, if gone through time up to historical myths, babies and newborn infants will have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti'. To remove Disti people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items used to remove Disti either Rock salt or Red chilies or Oiled cloth. Taking one of this item, people remove Disti by rotating their hand with one of the item above around the person who affected by Disti and they will burn the item.&lt;ref name="JackStephen2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&amp;pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1946, the American [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Henri Gamache]] published a text called ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed!'' (later reprinted as ''Protection against Evil''), which offers directions to defend oneself against the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Gamache, Henri (1946) ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed'' Raymond Publishing, New York, {{OCLC|9989883}}; reprinted in 1969 as ''Protection Against Evil'' Dorene, Dallas, Texas, {{OCLC|39132235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures over-complimenting is said to cast a curse. So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Film à clef'' is the film equivalent of the literary ''[[roman à clef]]'', and the two share the same techniques.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

Many ''films à clef'' are [[biopic]]s of Hollywood personalities.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

'''Folk music''' includes [[#Traditional folk music|traditional folk music]] and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century [[folk revival]]. Some types of folk music may be called [[world music]]. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and [[art music|classical styles]]. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

Starting in the mid-18th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (third) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called [[contemporary folk music]] or [[folk revival]] music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms.&lt;ref name="AboutDefinition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/glossary/g/FolkMusic.htm |publisher=About.com definition |title=Folk Music |first1=Kim |last1=Ruehl |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as [[folk rock]], [[folk metal]], and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in Romanian it shares a different name, and it often does not share the same people and animals as traditional music.

=== Definitions ===
A consistent definition of '''traditional folk music''' is elusive.&lt;ref name = NERevival&gt;''The Never-Ending Revival'' by Michael F. Scully  University of Illinois Press Urbana and Chicago 2008 {{ISBN|978-0252033339}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms ''folk music'', ''folk song'', and ''[[folk dance]]'' are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term ''[[folklore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] to describe "the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes".&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"&gt;Percy Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 1977, article "Folk Song".&lt;/ref&gt; The term further derives from the German expression ''[[Völkisch movement|Volk]]'', in the sense of "the people as a whole" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional folk music also includes most [[indigenous music]].&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt;

However, despite the assembly of an enormous body of work over some two centuries, there is still no certain definition of what folk music (or [[folklore]], or the [[Wikt:folk|folk]]) is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]], ''Studying Popular Music'', Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). {{ISBN|0335152759}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Some do not even agree that the term Folk Music should be used.&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of "old songs, with no known composers",&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2"&gt;Ronald D. Cohen ''Folk music: the basics'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary "process of [[oral transmission]].... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character".&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969"&gt;International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such definitions depend upon "(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...", upon "''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Seeger]] (1980), citing the approach of Redfield (1947) and Dundes (1965), quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;  One widely used definition is simply "Folk music is what the people sing".&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13"&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

For Scholes,&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; as well as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Béla Bartók]],&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5"&gt;A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already, "...seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived)",&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard 1990, p. 127.  ''Studying Popular Music''. Milton Keynes; Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0335152767|0335152759}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in "a community uninfluenced by art music"&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969" /&gt; and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favour of a simple distinction of economic class&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5" /&gt; yet for him true folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, "associated with a lower class"&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms folk music may be seen as part of a "schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'".&lt;ref name="Charles Seeger 1980 p.127"&gt;Charles Seeger (1980) quoted in Middleton (1990) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music in this genre is also often called ''traditional music.''  Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre.  For example, the [[Grammy Award]] previously used the terms "traditional music" and "traditional folk" for folk music that is not contemporary folk music.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==== Characteristics ====
From a historical perspective, traditional folk music had these characteristics:&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2016}}
* It was transmitted through an [[oral tradition]]. Before the 20th century, ordinary people were usually illiterate; they acquired songs by memorizing them. Primarily, this was not mediated by books or recorded or transmitted media. Singers may extend their repertoire using [[Broadside (music)|broadsheets]] or [[song book]]s, but these secondary enhancements are of the same character as the primary songs experienced in the flesh.
* The music was often related to [[Culture|national culture]]. It was culturally particular; from a particular region or culture. In the context of an [[immigrant]] group, folk music acquires an extra dimension for social cohesion. It is particularly conspicuous in immigrant societies, where [[Greek Australians]], [[Somali Americans]], [[Punjabi Canadians]], and others strive to emphasize their differences from the mainstream. They learn songs and dances that originate in the countries their grandparents came from.
* They commemorate historical and personal events. On certain days of the year, such as [[Easter]], [[May Day]], and [[Christmas]], particular songs celebrate the yearly cycle. [[Wedding]]s, [[birthday]]s, and [[funeral]]s may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. [[Choral music]] at these events brings children and non-professional singers to participate in a public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.
* The songs have been performed, by [[Convention (norm)|custom]], over a long period of time, usually several [[generation]]s.

As a side-effect, the following characteristics are sometimes present:
* There is no [[copyright]] on the songs. Hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This has become much less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.
* Fusion of cultures: Because cultures interact and change over time, traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures. The relevant factors may include instrumentation, [[Musical tuning|tunings]], [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], [[Phrasing (music)|phrasing]], subject matter, and even production methods.

==== Terminology ====

===== Tune =====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
In folk music, a ''tune'' is a short [[instrumental]] [[piece (music)|piece]], a [[melody]], often with repeating [[section (music)|sections]], and usually played a number of times. A collection of tunes with structural similarities is known as

=== Origins ===
[[File:Indian village musicians.jpg|thumb|Indians always distinguished between classical and folk music, though in the past even classical Indian music used to rely on the unwritten transmission of repertoire.]]
Throughout most of human prehistory and history, listening to [[recorded music]] was not possible. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. [[Manual labor]] often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the [[boredom]] of repetitive tasks, it kept the [[rhythm]] during [[Synchronization|synchronized]] pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as [[Sowing|planting]], [[weeding]], [[reaping]], [[threshing]], [[weaving]], and [[Milling (grinding)|milling]]. In [[leisure time]], singing and playing [[musical instrument]]s were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.&lt;ref name="SeegerLomaxDocumentary"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr9FP93o8Ro |title=To Hear Your Banjo Play, Alan Lomax's 1947 Documentary narrated by Pete Seeger |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that folk music originated as [[art music]] that was changed and probably debased by oral transmission, while reflecting the character of the society that produced it.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; In many societies, especially preliterate ones, the cultural transmission of folk music requires [[Learning music by ear|learning by ear]], although [[Musical notation|notation]] has evolved in some cultures. Different cultures may have different notions concerning a division between "folk" music on the one hand and of "art" and "court" music on the other. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some traditional folk music became also referred to "[[World music]]" or "Roots music".

The English term "[[folklore]]", to describe traditional folk music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; The distinction between "authentic" folk and national and [[popular song]] in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; – for example popular songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] could be termed "folk" in America.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Folk Music Council]] definition allows that the term can also apply to music that, "...has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

The post–[[World War II]] folk revival in America and in Britain started a new genre, [[Contemporary Folk Music|contemporary folk music]], and brought an additional meaning to the term "folk music": newly composed songs, fixed in form and by known authors, which imitated some form of traditional music. The popularity of "contemporary folk" recordings caused the appearance of the category "Folk" in the [[Grammy Award]]s of 1959: in 1970 the term was dropped in favor of "Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)", while 1987 brought a distinction between "Best Traditional Folk Recording" and "Best Contemporary Folk Recording". After that, they had a "Traditional music" category that subsequently evolved into others. The term "folk", by the start of the 21st century, could cover [[Singer-songwriter|singer songwriters]], such as [[Donovan]] from Scotland and American [[Bob Dylan]], who emerged in the 1960s and much more. This completed a process to where "folk music" no longer meant only traditional folk music.&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2" /&gt;

Traditional folk music often includes [[Lyrics|sung words]], although folk [[instrumental music]] occurs commonly in [[dancing music|dance music]] traditions. [[Narrative verse]] looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional [[epic poetry]], much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent ''[[in medias res]]'' plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of [[battle]]s or describe [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] or [[natural disaster]]s.

Sometimes, as in the triumphant ''[[Song of Deborah]]'' found in the [[Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Book of Judges]]'', these songs celebrate victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often also remember [[folk hero]]es such as [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] or [[Robin Hood]]. Some traditional song narratives recall [[supernatural]] events or mysterious deaths.

[[Hymn]]s and other forms of [[religious music]] are often of traditional and unknown origin. Western [[musical notation]] was originally created to preserve the lines of [[Gregorian chant]], which before its invention was taught as an oral tradition in [[monasticism|monastic]] communities. Traditional songs such as ''[[Green grow the rushes, O]]'' present religious lore in a mnemonic form, as do Western [[Christmas carol]]s and similar traditional songs.

[[Work song]]s frequently feature [[call and response (music)|call and response]] structures and are designed to enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts in accordance with the rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American [[armed force]]s, a lively oral tradition preserves [[jody call]]s ("Duckworth chants") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]]. [[Love poetry]], often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. [[Nursery rhyme]]s and [[nonsense verse]] used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.

Music transmitted by word of mouth through a community, in time, develops many variants, because this kind of transmission cannot produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy. Indeed, many traditional singers are quite creative and deliberately modify the material they learn.

For example, the words of "[[I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day]]" (Roud 975) are known from a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/acwwweng/ballads/image.pl?ref=Harding+B+20(69)&amp;id=08664.gif&amp;seq=1&amp;size=0 |title=Ballads Catalogue: Harding B 20(69) |publisher=Bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date is almost certainly before 1900, and it seems to be Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler [[Jeannie Robertson]] from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to "Jock Stewart", one of her relatives, and there are no Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist [[Archie Fisher]] deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 [[The Pogues]] took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Because variants proliferate naturally, it is naïve to believe that there is such a thing as the single "authentic" version of a [[ballad]] such as "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]". Field researchers in traditional song (see below) have encountered countless versions of this ballad throughout the English-speaking world, and these versions often differ greatly from each other. None can reliably claim to be the original, and it is possible that the "original" version ceased to be sung centuries ago.  Many versions can lay an equal claim to authenticity.

The influential folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological [[natural selection]]: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing&amp;nbsp;— it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.

Literary interest in the popular ballad form dates back at least to [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] and [[William Wordsworth]]. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical [[Suite (music)|suite]] was based upon stylised folk-dances, and [[Haydn and folk music|Joseph Haydn]]'s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term "folk" coincided with an "outburst of national feeling all over Europe" that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where [[Self-determination|national identity]] was most asserted. [[Musical nationalism|Nationalist composers]] emerged in Central Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], and many others drew upon folk melodies.

While the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of [[popular music]] is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world. The process is most advanced "where [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Commercialization|commercialisation]] of culture are most advanced"&lt;ref&gt;Alison Vardy, et al., [http://www.celticharpsheetmusic.com/about/traditional-music.htm About Traditional Music Page], Celtic Harp Sheet Music site. Accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs more gradually even in settings of lower technological advancement. However, the loss of traditional music is slowed in nations or regions where traditional folk music is a badge of cultural or national identity, for instance in the case of [[Bangladesh]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Pakistan]], [[Scotland]], [[Latvia]], [[Turkey]], [[Fado|Portugal]], [[Brittany]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]] and [[Music of Crete|Crete]]. Tourism revenue can provide a potent incentive to preserve local cultural distinctives. Local government often sponsors and promotes performances during tourist seasons, and revives lost traditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Early folk music, fieldwork and scholarship ===
Much of what is known about folk music prior to the development of audio recording technology in the 19th century comes from [[Field research|fieldwork]] and writings of scholars, collectors and proponents.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== 19th-century Europe ====
Starting in the 19th century, academics and amateur scholars, taking note of the musical traditions being lost, initiated various efforts to preserve the music of the people. One such effort was the collection by [[Francis James Child]] in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred [[ballad]]s in the English and Scots traditions (called the [[Child Ballads]]), some of which predated the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13" /&gt;

Contemporaneously with Child, the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] and later [[Cecil Sharp]] worked  to preserve a great body of English rural traditional song, music and dance, under the aegis of what became and remains the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS). Sharp campaigned with some success to have English traditional songs (in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs. Throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the Child Canon. He also advanced some significant theories concerning the workings of oral-aural tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Similar activity was also under way in other countries. One of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in [[Riga]] by [[Krisjanis Barons]], who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 Latvian folk songs, the ''Latvju dainas''. In Norway the work of collectors such as [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] was extensively used by Edvard Grieg in his ''Lyric Pieces'' for piano and in other works, which became immensely popular.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Around this time, composers of [[European classical music|classical music]] developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs, and a number of outstanding composers carried out their own field work on traditional music. These included [[Percy Grainger]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in England and [[Béla Bartók]] in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions. The ''Latviju dainas'' are extensively used in the classical choral works of [[Andrejs Jurāns]], [[Jānis Cimze]], and [[Emilis Melngailis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== North America ====
[[File:Cecil-sharp-appalachia-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Locations in Southern and Central Appalachia visited by the British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] in 1916 (blue), 1917 (green), and 1918 (red). Sharp sought "old world" English and Scottish ballads passed down to the region's inhabitants from their British ancestors. He collected hundreds of such ballads, the most productive areas being the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky.]]

The advent of [[audio recording]] technology provided folklorists with a revolutionary tool to preserve vanishing musical forms. The earliest American folk music scholars were with the [[American Folklore Society]] (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Library of Congress]] worked through the offices of traditional music collectors [[Robert Winslow Gordon]], [[Alan Lomax]] and others to capture as much North American field material as possible.  Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, ''Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads''.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s. Cecil Sharp also worked in America, recording the traditional songs of the Appalachian Mountains in 1916–1918 in collaboration with [[Maud Karpeles]] and [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and is considered the first major scholar covering American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Sharp are represented under other names by actors in the modern movie ''[[Songcatcher]]''.

One strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], the analysis of the diversity of folk music (and related cultures) based on regions of the US rather than based on a given song's historical roots. Later, a dynamic of class and circumstances was added to this.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 32–37&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent regionalists were literary figures with a particular interest in folklore. [[Carl Sandburg]] often traveled the U.S. as a writer and a poet.  He also collected songs in his travels and, in 1927, published them in the book ''[[The American Songbag]]''. "In his collections of folk songs, Sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of American folk music. This was the final element of the foundation upon which the early folk music revivalists constructed their own view of Americanism. Sandburg's [[working class]] Americans joined with the [[Ethnic group|ethnically]], [[Race (human categorization)|racially]], and regionally diverse citizens that other scholars, public intellectuals, and folklorists celebrated their own definitions of the American folk, definitions that the folk revivalists used in constructing their own understanding of American folk music, and an overarching American identity".&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1930s, the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors.  The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, themes and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;  Regionalism and [[cultural pluralism]] grew as influences and themes.  During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55" /&gt; Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party's interest in folk music as a way to reach and influence Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Guthrie]] exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.

Folk music festivals proliferated during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 44–52&lt;/ref&gt; [[President Franklin Roosevelt]] was a fan of folk music, hosted folk concerts at the [[White House]], and often patronized folk festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  One prominent festival was [[Sarah Gertrude Knott]]'s [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]], established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Williams, ''Staging Tradition: John Lair and Sarah Gertrude Knott'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the sponsorship of [[the Washington Post]], the festival was held in Washington, DC at Constitution Hall from 1937–1942.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt; The folk music movement, festivals, and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy, cultural pluralism, and the removal of culture and race-based barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 105–07&lt;/ref&gt;

The American folk music revivalists of the 1930s approached folk music in different ways.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt; Three primary schools of thought emerged: "Traditionalists" (e.g. Sarah Gertrude Knott and [[John Lomax]]) emphasized the preservation of songs as artifacts of deceased cultures. "Functional" folklorists (e.g. Botkin and Alan Lomax) maintained that songs only retain relevance when utilized by those cultures which retain the traditions which birthed those songs.  "Left-wing" folk revivalists (e.g. Charles Seeger and Lawrence Gellert) emphasized music's role "in 'people's' struggles for social and political rights".&lt;ref name="Donaldson87"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1930s these and others had turned American folk music into a social movement.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt;

Sometimes folk musicians became scholars and advocates themselves. For example, [[Jean Ritchie]] (born in 1922) was the youngest child of a large family from [[Viper, Kentucky]] that had preserved many of the old [[Appalachia]]n traditional songs. Ritchie, living in a time when the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] had opened up to outside influence, was university educated and ultimately moved to New York City, where she made a number of classic recordings of the family repertoire and published an important compilation of these songs.

In January 2012, the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]], with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that they would release Lomax's vast archive of 1946 and later recording in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an [[Interactive Multimedia|interactive multimedia]] educational computer project he called the [[Cantometrics#Cantometrics as an educational tool|Global Jukebox]], which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of [[film]], 3,000 [[videotape]]s, and 5,000 [[photograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ "The Premiere of the Global Jukebox".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ |date=2012-02-02 }} Radio interview with Don Fleming by [[John Hockenberry]] on [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s [[The Takeaway]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, this has been accomplished.

Many Asian civilizations distinguish between [[Art music|art]]/court/[[Classical music|classical]] styles and "folk" music, though cultures that do not depend greatly upon notation and have much anonymous art music must distinguish the two in different ways from those suggested by western scholars. For example, the late [[Alam Lohar]] is a good example of a classical South Asian folk singer of great repute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Khunung Eshei/Khuland Eshei is an ancient folk song&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Manipur folk art performances mesmerise Madurai|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manipur-folk-art-performances-mesmerise-madurai/article3028787.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2006-12-03|access-date = 2015-12-21|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] of [[Manipur]] who have maintained it for thousands of years. &lt;!--Several claims here need verifying: (1) that many Asian cultures differentiate art/court/classical styles and folk music, (2) that these cultures distinguish these categories in ways different from those suggested by Western scholars, and (3) that Alam Lohar is a good example of a singer of great repute.

===== Folk music of China =====
{{Further|Music of China#Folk music|Shijing|Yuefu}}
Archaeological discoveries date [[Culture of China|Chinese]] folk music back 7000 years; it is largely based on the [[pentatonic scale]].

[[Han dynasty|Han]] traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of [[oboe]] called a [[suona]] and apercussive ensembles called a [[chuigushou]]. Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[Dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an]] drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.

In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken women. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin. [[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories, myths and legends.

It is considered less developed/evolved, true to the folk tradition and a preserving of a more ancient artform. It is limited to approximately 3–4 notes and is used by the ordinary people for pleasure and entertainment.
* Nadagam music is a more developed form of drama influenced from South Indian street drama which was introduced by some south Indian Artists.  [[Phillippu Singho]] from Negombo in 1824 Performed “[[Harishchandra Nadagama]]” in [[Hanguranketha Divisional Secretariat|Hnguranketha]] which was originally written in [[Telugu language|Telingu]] language. Later “Maname”, “Sanda kinduru” and few others were introduced. [[Don Bastian]] of [[Dehiwala]] introduced Noorthy firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then [[John de Silva|John De Silva]] developed it as did Ramayanaya in 1886.
* [[Sinhala light music]] is currently the most popular type of music in Sri Lanka and enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, nadagam music, noorthy music, [[film music]], classical music, western music, and others. Some artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakone]] was the pioneer of this and also composed the national anthem.
The classical [[Sinhalese Orchestra]] consists of five categories of instruments, but among the [[percussion instrument]]s, the [[drum]] is essential for dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |title=Sri Lankan Music Instrument &amp; sounds |publisher=Info.lk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211001325/http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vibrant beat of the rhythm of the drums form the basic of the dance. The dancers feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflect the complex rhythms of the drum beat. This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a [[crescendo]] of intensity. There are six common types of drums falling within 3 styles (one-faced, two-faced, and flat-faced):
* The typical Sinhala Dance is identified as the [[Kandy]]an dance and the [[Geta Bera|Gatabera]] drum is indispensable to this dance.
* [[Yak Bera|Yak-bera]] is the demon drum or the, drum used in low country dance in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art.
* The Dawula is a [[barrel]]-shaped drum, and it was used as a companion drum in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.
* The [[Thammattama]] is flat, two-faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the afore mentioned Dawula.
* A small double headed hand drum, used to accompany songs. It is mostly heard in the poetry dances (vannam).
* The Rabana is a flat faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has to be placed on the floor like a circular short-legged [[Table (furniture)|table]] and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the [[Sinhalese New Year]] and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion.  The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it wherever he goes.

Other instruments include:
* The "[[Thalampata]]" – 2 small cymbals joined together by a string.
* The wind section, is dominated by an instrument akin to the [[clarinet]]. This is not normally used for the dances. This is important to note because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.
* The [[flute]]s of metal such as silver &amp; brass produce [[Shrillness|shrill]] music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing. The [[conch-shell]] ([[Hakgediya]]) is another form of a natural instrument, and the player blows it to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.
* The [[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilisation of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. The bowl is made of cut coconut shell, the mouth of which is covered with goat hide. A dandi, made of bamboo, is attached to this shell. The principal strings are two: one of steel and the other of a set of horsehair. The long bow has jingle bells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2011/02/09/art21.asp |title=&amp;#124;&amp;#124; Daily News Online Edition |location=Sri Lanka  |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004045/http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=%2F2011%2F02%2F09%2Fart21.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailynews.lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |title=Artscope &amp;#124; Online edition of Daily News – Lakehouse Newspapers |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004038/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{See also|Australian folk music|Indigenous Australian music}}
Folk song traditions were taken to Australia by early settlers from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of [[bush ballads]] often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt;

The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australian music]] includes the music of [[Australian Aborigine]]s and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are collectively called [[Indigenous Australians]]; it incorporates a variety of distinctive traditional [[music]] styles practiced by Indigenous Australian peoples, as well as a range of contemporary musical styles of and [[fusion (music)|fusion]] with European traditions as interpreted and performed by indigenous Australian artists. Music has formed an integral part of the [[society|social]], [[culture|cultural]] and ceremonial observances of these peoples, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and [[musical instrument]]ation unique to particular regions or [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Indigenous Australian groups]]. Equal elements of musical tradition are common through much of the [[Australia]]n continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of [[New Guinea]] and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052935/http://www.wilurarra.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=24 Wilurarra Creative (2010).

===== Celtic traditional music =====
{{See also|Folk music of Ireland|Folk music of Scotland}}
[[Celtic music]] is a term used by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the [[Celtic people]]s. These traditions include [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of the Isle of Man|Manx]], [[Music of Cornwall|Cornish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]], and [[Breton music|Breton]] traditions. [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Asturian and Galician music]] is often included, though there is no significant research showing that this has any close musical relationship. [[Music of Brittany|Brittany]]'s Folk revival began in the 1950s with the "bagadoù" and the "kan-ha-diskan" before growing to world fame through [[Alan Stivell]]'s work since the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=saw&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sawyers, June Skinner|title=Celtic Music: A Complete Guide|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0306810077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] (although its members were all Irish-born, the group became famous while based in New York's Greenwich Village), [[The Dubliners]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[Planxty]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Corrs]], [[The Irish Rovers]], and a variety of other folk bands have done much over the past few decades to revitalise and re-popularise [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]]. These bands were rooted, to a greater or lesser extent, in a tradition of Irish music and benefited from the efforts of artists such as [[Seamus Ennis]] and [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=saw /&gt;

In [[Scotland]], [[The Corries]], [[Silly Wizard]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[Runrig]], [[Jackie Leven]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Karine Polwart]], [[Alasdair Roberts (musician)|Alasdair Roberts]], [[Dick Gaughan]], [[Wolfstone]], [[Boys of the Lough]], and [[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]] have kept Scottish folk vibrant and fresh by mixing traditional Scottish and Gaelic folk songs with more contemporary genres. These artists have also been commercially successful in continental Europe and North America. There is an emerging wealth of talent in the Scottish traditional music scene, with bands such as [[Mànran]], [[Skipinnish]], Barluath and [[Breabach]] and solo artists such as Patsy Reid, [[Robyn Stapleton]] and Mischa MacPherson gaining many successes in recent years.

===== Central and Eastern Europe =====
{{See also|Music of Belarus|Hungarian folk music|Music of Moldova|Russian traditional music|Music of Ukraine|Bard (Soviet Union)|Music of Slovenia|Czech folklore}}
During the Communist era national folk dancing in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was actively promoted by the state. Dance troupes from Russia and Poland toured non-communist Europe from about 1937 to 1990. The [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]] recorded many albums. Eastern Europe is also the origin of the Jewish [[Klezmer]] tradition.
[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
The [[polka]] is a central European [[dance]] and also a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[dancing music|dance music]] familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. It originated in the middle of the 19th century in [[Bohemia]]. Polka is still a popular genre of folk music in many European countries and is performed by folk artists in [[Poland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Netherlands]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Slovakia]]. Local varieties of this dance are also found in the [[Nordic countries]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Latin America]] (especially [[Mexico]]), and in the [[United States]].

German [[Lied|Volkslieder]] perpetuated by [[Liederhandschrift]]en manuscripts like ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' date back to medieval [[Minnesang]] and [[Meistersinger]] traditions. Those folk songs revived in the late 18th century period of [[German Romanticism]], first promoted by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and other advocates of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], later compiled by [[Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] (''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'') as well as by [[Ludwig Uhland]].

The [[Volksmusik]] and [[folk dance]]s genre, especially in the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] (''[[Ranz des Vaches|Kuhreihen]]'') and [[South Tyrol]], up to today has clinged on rustic communities against the backdrop of [[industrialisation]]—Low German [[sea shanty|shanties]] or the [[Wienerlied]] (''[[Schrammelmusik]]'') being notable exceptions. [[Music of Slovenia|Slovene]] folk music in [[Upper Carniola]] and [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] also originated from the Alpine traditions. Traditional ''Volksmusik'' is not to be confused with commercial ''[[Volkstümliche Musik]]'' variations, strongly related to German [[Schlager music]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Hungarian group [[Muzsikás]] played numerous American tours and participated in the Hollywood movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' while the singer [[Márta Sebestyén]] worked with the band [[Deep Forest]]. The Hungarian ''[[táncház]]'' movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]] in [[Transylvania]]. The táncház movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created a new kind of music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities elsewhere in the world.

===== Balkan music =====

[[File:Misteriata-na-balgarskite-glasove.jpg|thumb|[[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices]]]]
The Balkan folk music was influenced by the mingling of Balkan ethnic groups in the period of [[Ottoman Empire]]. It comprises the [[music of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]], [[Music of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Music of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Music of Romania|Romania]], [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Music of Albania|Albania]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkey]], some of the historical states of [[Music of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] or the [[Music of Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] and geographical regions such as [[Music of Thrace|Thrace]]. Some music is characterised by complex rhythm.

A notable act is [[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices]], which won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buchanan|first1=Donna A.|title=Performing democracy : Bulgarian music and musicians in transition|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226078267|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Winners |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;field_nominee_work_value=mystere&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |website=Grammy.com |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6REsU6GWu?url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;field_nominee_work_value=mystere&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |archivedate=21 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= |date=2017-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of the whole Balkan folk music is the music of the local [[Romani music|Romani]] ethnic minority.

===== Nordic folk music =====

Nordic folk music includes a number of traditions in [[Northern Europe]]an, especially [[Scandinavia]]n, countries.  The [[Nordic countries]] are generally taken to include [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. Sometimes it is taken to include [[Greenland]] and historically the [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

The many regions of the Nordic countries share certain traditions, many of which have diverged significantly.  It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, contrasted with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.  Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations.  The Saami of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.

[[Swedish folk music]] is a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[music]] based largely on [[folkloristics|folkloric]] collection work that began in the early 19th century in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky, David (2005) pp. 33–41. "Hidden Traditions: Conceptualizing Swedish Folk Music in the Twenty-First Century."  Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the [[fiddle]].  Another common [[musical instrument|instrument]], unique to Swedish traditions, is the [[nyckelharpa]].  Most Swedish instrumental folk music is [[dance music]]; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the [[polska (dance)|polska]].  Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share [[Tune (folk music)|tunes]] historically, though they have been performed separately.&lt;ref&gt;Jersild, Margareta (1976) pp. 53–66. "Om förhållandet mellan vokalt och instrumentalt i svensk folkmusik.  ''Svensk tidskrift för musikforskning'' 58(2): 53–66. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with the [[folk music revival]] of the 1970s, [[vocalist]]s and [[instrumentalist]]s have also begun to perform together in folk music [[musical ensemble|ensembles]].

==== Latin and South America ====
{{See also|Andean music|Cueca|Nueva canción}}
Folk music on the Americas consists on the encounter and union of three main musical types: European traditional music, traditional music of the American natives and tribal African music that arrived among the slaves, main differences consist on the particular type of each of these main slopes.

Particular case of Latin and South American music points to [[Andean music]] among other native musical styles (such as Caribbean, pampean and selvatic), Iberean music ([[Music of Spain|Spain]] and [[Music of Portugal|Portugal]]) and generally speaking [[Music of Africa|African]] tribal music, that fused together evolving in differentiated musical forms along South and Central America.

[[Andean music]] comes from the general area inhabited by [[Quechua people|Quechuas]], [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and other peoples that roughly in the area of the [[Inca Empire]] prior to European contact. It includes folklore music of parts of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The [[Nueva Canción]] movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and bought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

[[Nueva canción]] (Spanish for 'new song') is a movement and genre within [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Iberia]]n music of folk music, folk-inspired music and socially committed music. It some respects its development and role is similar to the second folk music revival. This includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music, essentially contemporary folk music except that that English genre term is not commonly applied to it. Nueva cancion is recognized as having played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.

Nueva cancion first surfaced during the 1960s as "The Chilean New Song" in [[Chile]]. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. Nueva canción renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American [[New Left]], [[Liberation Theology]], [[hippie]] and [[human rights]] movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout [[Latin America]], and is regarded as a precursor to [[Rock en español]].

[[Cueca]] is a family of musical styles and associated dances from [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Argentina]].

[[Trova]] and [[Son (music)|Son]] are styles of traditional [[Cuban music]] originating in the province of Oriente that includes influences from Spanish song and dance such as [[Bolero]] and [[contradanza]] as well as [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythm and percussion elements.

[[Moda de viola]] is the name designed to Brazilian folk music. Is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar, but the most traditional instrument is the [[viola caipira]]. The songs basically detailed the hardness of life of those who work in the country. The themes are usually associated with the land, animals, folklore, impossible love and separation. Although there are some upbeat songs, most of them are nostalgic and melancholic.

{{See also|Canadian folk music|Music of Canada|French-Canadian music}}
Canada's traditional folk music is particularly diverse.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;  Even prior to liberalizing its immigration laws in the 1960s, Canada was ethnically diverse with dozens of different Indigenous and European groups present.  In terms of music, academics do not speak of a Canadian tradition, but rather ethnic traditions ([[Acadian music]], [[Irish-Canadian music]], [[Blackfoot music]], [[Innu music]], [[Inuit music]], [[Métis fiddle]], etc.) and later in Eastern Canada regional traditions ([[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland music]], [[Cape Breton fiddling]], [[Quebecois music]], etc.)

{{quote|Traditional folk music of European origin has been present in Canada since the arrival of the first French and British settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries....They fished the coastal waters and farmed the shores of what became Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the St Lawrence River valley of Quebec.

The fur trade and its [[voyageurs]] brought this farther north and west into Canada; later lumbering operations and lumberjacks continued this process.

Agrarian settlement in eastern and southern Ontario and western Quebec in the early 19th century established a favorable milieu for the survival of many Anglo-Canadian folksongs and broadside ballads from Great Britain and the US. Despite massive industrialization, folk music traditions have persisted in many areas until today. In the north of Ontario, a large Franco-Ontarian population kept folk music of French origin alive.

Populous Acadian communities in the Atlantic provinces contributed their song variants to the huge corpus of folk music of French origin centred in the province of Quebec. A rich source of Anglo-Canadian folk music can be found in the Atlantic region, especially Newfoundland. Completing this mosaic of musical folklore is the Gaelic music of Scottish settlements, particularly in Cape Breton, and the hundreds of Irish songs whose presence in eastern Canada dates from the Irish famine of the 1840s, which forced the large migrations of Irish to North America.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Peacock, Carmelle Bégin |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/folk-music-emc/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=Folk music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Knowledge of the [[history of Canada]]", wrote Isabelle Mills in 1974, "is essential in understanding the mosaic of Canadian folk song. Part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of Canada brought by European and Anglo-Saxon settlers to the new land."&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;Mills, Isabelle (1974). http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/2/v2art5.html The Heart of the Folk Song, ''[[Canadian Journal for Traditional Music]]'' Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She describes how the French colony at Québec brought French immigrants, followed before long by waves of immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, all bringing music from their homelands, some of which survives into the present day. Ethnographer and folklorist [[Marius Barbeau]] estimated that well over ten thousand French folk songs and their variants had been collected in Canada. Many of the older ones had by then died out in France.

Music as professionalized paid entertainment grew relatively slowly in Canada, especially remote rural areas, through the 19th and early 20th centuries.  While in urban music clubs of the [[dance hall]]/[[vaudeville]] variety became popular, followed by jazz, rural Canada remained mostly a land of traditional music. Yet when American radio networks began broadcasting into Canada in the 1920s and 1930s, the audience for Canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of [[Nashville sound|American Nashville-style country music]] and urban styles like jazz.  The [[Americanization]] of Canadian music led the [[Canadian Radio League]] to lobby for a national public broadcaster in the 1930s, eventually leading to the creation of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1936. The CBC promoted Canadian music, including traditional music, on its radio and later television services, but the [[modernism|mid-century craze for all things "modern"]] led to the decline of folk music relative to rock and pop. Canada was however influenced by the folk music revival of the 1960s, when  local venues such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and other folk clubs and coffee houses across the country, became crucibles for emerging songwriters and performers as well as for interchange with artists visiting from abroad.

===== United States =====
{{See also|American folk music}}
American traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the [[United States]] or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]]. Some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music.
* [[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially [[country music]], and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.
* [[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences, including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American [[blues]].  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].  Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music&amp;nbsp;– Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Frank Proffitt]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].  Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.
* The [[Carter Family]] was a [[American folk music|traditional American folk music]] group that recorded between 1927 and 1956.

"Folk music revival" refers to either a period of renewed interest in traditional folk music, or to an event or period which transforms it; the latter usually includes a social activism component. A prominent example of the former is the British folk revival of approximately 1890–1920. The most prominent and influential example of the latter (to the extent that it is usually called "''the'' folk music revival") is the folk revival of the mid 20th century, centered in the English-speaking world which gave birth to contemporary folk music.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 18–19}}  See the "[[Contemporary folk music]]" article for a description of this revival.

One earlier revival influenced western [[classical music]]. Such composers as [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Béla Bartók]], made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.

In Spain, [[Isaac Albéniz]] (1860–1909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the ''[[Suite Iberia]]'' (1906–1909). [[Enrique Granados]] (1867–1918) composed ''[[zarzuela]]'', Spanish light opera, and ''Danzas Españolas'' – Spanish Dances. [[Manuel de Falla]] (1876–1946) became interested in the [[cante jondo]] of Andalusian [[flamenco]], the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include ''[[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]]'' and ''Siete canciones populares españolas'' ("Seven Spanish Folksongs", for voice and piano). Composers such as [[Fernando Sor]] and [[Francisco Tarrega]] established the [[guitar]] as Spain's national instrument.  Modern Spanish folk artists abound ([[Mil i Maria]], [[Russian Red]], et al.) modernizing while respecting the traditions of their forebears.

Flamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. French classical composers, from [[Bizet]] to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognized.

Folk music revivals or [[roots revival]]s also encompass a range of phenomena around the world where there is a renewed interest in traditional music.  This is often by the young, often in the traditional music of their own country, and often included new incorporation of social awareness, causes, and evolutions of new music in the same style. [[Nueva canción]], a similar evolution of a new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish speaking countries.

=== First British folk revival ===
The "first" [[British folk revival]] was a [[roots revival]] which occurred approximately 1890–1920 and was marked by heightened interest in traditional music and its preservation. It arose from earlier developments, perhaps combined with changes in the nature of British identity, led to a much more intensive and academic attempt to record what was seen as a vanishing tradition, and is now usually referred to as the first English or British folk revival.

It is sometimes claimed that the earliest folk festival was the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, 1928, in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], founded by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]]. The [[National Folk Festival (USA)]] is an itinerant folk festival in the [[United States]]. Since 1934, it has been run by the [[National Council for the Traditional Arts]] (NCTA) and has been presented in 26 communities around the nation. After leaving some of these communities, the National Folk Festival has [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] several locally run folk festivals in its wake including the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], the Richmond Folk Festival, the [[American Folk Festival]] and, most recently, the Montana Folk Festival.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[Newport Folk Festival]] is an annual folk festival held near Newport, Rhode Island. It ran most year from 1959 to 1970, and 1985 to the present, with an attendance of approximately 10,000 persons.

The four-day [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] began in 1962. It is sponsored by the non-profit Philadelphia Folksong Society. The event hosts contemporary and traditional artists in genres including World/Fusion, Celtic, Singer/Songwriter, Folk Rock, Country, Klezmer, and Dance. It is held annually on the third weekend in August. The event now hosts approximately 12,000 visitors, presenting bands on 6 stages.

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major.

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]].

[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting [[evolutionary computing]] to create visual form include those created by [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]].

[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
[[Michael Noll|A. Michael Noll]], of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A.

The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurizio Bolognini]] works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini, ''De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital''  ([http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm From interactivity to democracy.

[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] pushed this theme further, transforming "data sets" as diverse as musical scores (in "Shape of Song", 2001) and Wikipedia edits ([[History Flow]], 2003, with [[Fernanda Viegas]]) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist [[San Base]] developed a "Dynamic Painting" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as "brush strokes," Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbasestudio.com/about.htm San Base: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Architecture===
In 1987 [[Celestino Soddu]] created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Celestino Soddu [http://www.soddu.it/progetti/med.htm Soddu: "Italian Medieval Town"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/complexism_chapter.pdf ''Complexism and the role of evolutionary art''] in "The art of artificial evolution : a handbook on evolutionary art and music", Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">[[File:Crystal Gradation.JPG|thumb|''Crystal Gradation'' by [[Paul Klee]], watercolour, 1921.]]
'''Gradation''' in art is a visual technique of gradually transitioning from one colour hue to another, or from one shade to another, or one texture to another.  Space, distance, atmosphere, volume, and curved or rounded forms are some of the visual effects created with gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gradation.svg|thumb|A gradient illustration, showing a gradation spectrum from black to white.]]
Artists use a variety of methods to create gradation, depending upon the art medium, and the precise desired effect. [[Blending (art)|Blending]], [[shading (art)|shading]], [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]] are common methods.  A fading effect can be created with [[pastels]] by using a [[torchon (art)|torchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gradation in photography==
Gradation can also be useful in composing photographs. The early decades of the development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: {{blockquote|The great defect of all the processes of photolithography described in the last section is that they can only be applied with advantage to the reproduction of drawings or subjects in which the gradation of shade is shown by lines or dots separated by white spaces of varying sizes and at varying intervals apart, as in line or stipple engravings and lithographs in line and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British Journal of Photography|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1878|volume=XXV|pages=518|author=J. Waterhouse, Capt.|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[File:Halftone example CMYK.png|thumb|Example of a halftone reproduction of a photograph.]]
A major innovation was the development of [[halftone]] photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a [[Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT)]], with a [[halftone screen]] as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.

Analog photography is limited by the materials and equipment used by the photographer to capture gradation. These constraints are eliminated in digital photography, where software can be used to manipulate photograph images to create gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Lambrecht |author2=Ralph W.

A '''grisaille''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|eɪ|l}}; {{lang-fr|gris}} {{IPA-fr|ɡʁizaj|}} 'grey') is a [[painting]] executed entirely in shades of grey or of another neutral greyish colour.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly used in large decorative schemes in imitation of sculpture. Many grisailles include a slightly wider colour range, like the [[Andrea del Sarto]] fresco illustrated. Paintings executed in brown are referred to as [[brunaille]], and paintings executed in green are called [[verdaille]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grisaille may be executed for its own sake, as [[underpainting]] for an [[oil painting]] (in preparation for glazing layers of colour over it), or as a [[Physical model|model]] for an [[engraver]] to work from. "Rubens and his school sometimes use monochrome techniques in sketching compositions for engravers."&lt;ref&gt;'''Oxford Companion to Art.''' Ed. Harold Osborne; Clarendon Press. Oxford, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Full colouring of a subject makes many more demands of an artist, and working in grisaille was often chosen as being quicker and cheaper, although the effect was sometimes deliberately chosen for aesthetic reasons. Grisaille paintings resemble the [[drawing]]s, normally in monochrome, that artists from the Renaissance on were trained to produce; like drawings they can also betray the hand of a less talented assistant more easily than a fully coloured painting.

==History==
[[File:Hans Memling 016.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Hans Memling]] wing, with [[donor portrait]] in colour below grisaille Madonna imitating sculpture.]]
[[Giotto]] used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], and [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of [[triptych]]s, including the [[Ghent Altarpiece]]. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However today these images are often invisible in museums when the tryptych is displayed open and flat against a wall. In these cases imitation of sculpture was intended; sculpture was still more expensive than a painting even by a top master.

[[Illuminated manuscript]]s had often been produced in pen and [[watercolour|wash]] with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as [[Jean Pucelle]] and [[Matthew Paris]] specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] times. Renaissance artists such as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]] often used grisaille as a classicising effect, either in imitation of the effect of a classical [[sculpture]]d relief, or of [[Ancient Roman art|Roman painting]].

In the Low Countries a continuous tradition of grisaille paintings can be traced from [[Early Netherlandish painting]] to [[Martin Heemskerck]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] (''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'') and [[Hendrik Goltzius]], and through the copious output of [[Adriaen van de Venne]], to the circle of [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jan van Goyen]].

The ceiling [[fresco]]es of the [[Sistine Chapel]] have portions of the design in grisaille, as does the lower part of the great staircase decoration by [[Antonio Verrio]] at [[Hampton Court]].

=== Modern examples ===

Grisaille, while less widespread in the 20th Century, continues as an artistic technique. [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso's]] painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' is one contemporary example.

[[Hugo Bastidas]] is a contemporary American painter known for black and white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black and white photographs.&lt;ref name = carvalho&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Carvalho|first1=Denise|title=Hugo Bastidas at Nohra Haime|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2008|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastidas’ paintings frequently reference architecture, water, vegetation and art history, and reflect his concern about [[The Human Condition|the human condition]], [[globalization]], and their effect on the Earth’s well-being.&lt;ref name = gallerybio&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.nohrahaimegallery.com/hugo-bastidas.html|publisher=Nohra Haime Gallery|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to New York from a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in his native Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt; His medium- and large-scale paintings allude to black-and-white photography, and feature contrasting zones of high and low detail.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Jessica|title=Without Hue: A Rainbow of Grays|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/12/14/without-hue-a-rainbow-of-grays/23de1b30-cba4-4f12-bb05-bd11f9fda6ac/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's bristle brush on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieves a high level of image definition.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardier|first1=Laura|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=http://www.artealdia.com/International/Contents/Reviews/Hugo_Bastidas|publisher=Arte Al Dia|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.mattmuseum.org/exhibition/hugo-bastidas/|publisher=Mattatuck Museum|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
With the 20th century's emphasis on direct (''[[alla prima]]'') painting, the grisaille technique lost favour with artists of the period. This historic method is still incorporated into the curriculum of some private [[studio|ateliers]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at The Contemporary Realist Academy, in Memphis, Tennessee, The Ryder Studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Ecole Albert Defois in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In enamel and stained glass==
[[File:Magi Herod MNMA Cl23532.jpg|thumb|140px|Grisaille stained glass (15th century)]]
The term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], where an effect similar to a [[relief]] in silver may be intended. It is common in [[stained glass]], where the need for sections in different colours was thereby greatly reduced. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille — using, for example, [[silver stain]] or vitreous paint — while other sections are done in coloured glass.

'''''Les Nabis''''' ({{IPA-fr|le nabi}}) were a group of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] [[avant-garde]] artists who set the pace for [[fine arts]] and [[graphic arts]] in [[France]] in the 1890s. Initially a group of friends interested in contemporary art and literature, most of them studied at the private art school of [[Rodolphe Julian]] (the [[Académie Julian]]) in [[Paris]] in the late 1880s.

In 1890, they began to participate successfully in public exhibitions, while most of their artistic output remained in private hands or in the possession of the artists themselves. By 1896, the unity of the group had already begun to break: ''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', painted by [[Maurice Denis]] in 1900, recollects memories of a time already gone, even before the term ''Nabis'' had been revealed to the public. Meanwhile, most members of the group, including [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Édouard Vuillard]], could stand on their own artistically. Only [[Paul Sérusier]] had problems to overcome—though it was his ''Talisman'', painted at the advice of [[Paul Gauguin]], that had revealed to them the way to go.

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Maurice Denis Homage to Cezanne 1900.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', Maurice Denis, 1900. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris.]]
''Nabi'' means ''[[prophet]]'' in both Hebrew and Arabic.{{efn|The French term ''nabi'' (also used in English), referring to a person inspired to speak the word of God, is clearly related to the Hebrew term for ''prophet''{{snd}}{{lang|he|נביא}} (''navi''){{snd}}and the similar Arabic word {{lang|ar|نَبِيّ}} (''nabiyy''). The word appears in many languages, including Indonesian.}}

''Les Nabis'' originated as a rebellious group of young student artists who banded together at the Académie Julian. Paul Sérusier galvanized ''Les Nabis'' and provided the name; he also disseminated among them the example of [[Paul Gauguin]]. [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], and [[Maurice Denis]] became the best known of the group, but at the time they were somewhat peripheral to the core group.

The term was coined by the linguist Auguste Cazalis, who drew a parallel between the way these painters aimed to revitalize painting (as ''prophets of [[modern art]]'') and the way the ancient prophets had rejuvenated Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, headword ''nabi''&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the nickname arose because "most of them wore beards, some were Jews and all were desperately earnest".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, L. &amp; Hanson, E., ''Post-Impressionists'' xi. p.{{nbsp}}277&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Nabis'' regarded themselves as initiates, and used a private vocabulary. They called a studio an ''ergasterium'' and ended their letters with the initials ''E.T.P.M.V. et M.P.'', meaning "En ta paume, mon verbe et ma pensée" (In your palm, my word and my thoughts.)

==Influence==
Meeting at [[Académie Julian]], and then at the apartment of [[Paul Ranson]], they preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbols]]. Paving the way for the early 20th-century development of [[abstract art|abstract]] and nonrepresentational art, they had in common with most progressive artists of the time the goal of integrating art and daily life.

==Style==
[[File:Les Parisiennes cph.3g10009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre Bonnard]], ''Les Parisiennes'' 1893, [[lithograph]]]]
''Les Nabis'' artists worked in a variety of media, using oils on both canvas and cardboard, and [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] on canvas and wall decoration, and they also produced posters, prints, book illustrations, textiles and furniture. Considered to be on the cutting edge of modern art during their early period, their subject matter was representational (though often [[Symbolist]] in inspiration), but was design-oriented along the lines of the Japanese prints they so admired, and [[Art Nouveau]]. Unlike those types{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Unlike those types of what? Judging from what follows, the comparison is between one type of artist and another type of artist, but no artist types have been mentioned before this.--&gt;, however, the artists of this circle were highly influenced by the paintings of the [[Impressionists]], and thus while sharing the flatness, page layout, and negative space of art nouveau and other decorative modes, much of ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' art has a painterly, non-realistic look, with color palettes reminiscent of [[Cézanne]] and Gauguin. Bonnard's posters and lithographs are more firmly in the Art Nouveau, or [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] manner. After the turn of the century, as modern art moved towards [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Cubism]], ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' were viewed as conservatives and, indeed, were among the last group of artists to stick to the roots and artistic ambitions of the Impressionists, pursuing these ends almost into the middle of the 20th{{nbsp}} century. In their later years, these painters also largely abandoned their earlier interests in decorative and applied arts.

==Members and associates==

Among the artists who considered themselves Nabis was Maurice Denis, whose journalism put the aims of the group in the eye of a progressive audience, and whose definition of a painting{{snd}}"a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order"{{cite quote|date=May 2017}}{{snd}}expressed the Nabis approach. His ''Théories'' (1920; 1922) summed up the Nabis' aims long after they had been superseded by the [[Fauvism|fauve]] painters and by cubism.

Other Nabis were Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]], Paul Ranson, and [[Félix Vallotton]]. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] was associated for a time with the group. The Scot James Pitcairn-Knowles and the Hungarian Jozsef Rippl-Ronai lived together in Paris during the first decade of the 20th{{nbsp}}century and also turned to glass-blowing and woodcarving. The [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] styles they embraced skirted some aspects of contemporary art nouveau and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The influence of the English [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] set them to work in media that involved crafts beyond painting: printmaking, book illustration and poster design, textiles, and set design.

'''Meditative poetry''' combines the religious practice of [[meditation]] with [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It occurs in many cultures, especially in Asian, European and Hindu cultures. Especially [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988;73-88).

In [[Christianity]], meditation became a major [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] practice during the [[Middle Ages]], closely associated with the life in [[monasteries]]. Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from [[contemplation]]. While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the [[Bible]], contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind. Both, contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Jesuits like [[Ignatius of Loyola]] formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding and will. His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points ([[analysis]]); the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32). [[Jesuits]] brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72). [[Calvinist]] and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.

[[Puritan]] meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life. In 1628, [[Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576–1633)|Thomas Taylor]] wrote a Puritan handbook ''Meditation from the Creatures'', recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory). In colonial [[New England]], [[Thomas Hooker]] defined meditation in ''The Souls Preparation for Christ'' (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."

In 1648, the ''Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly'' made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 [[Richard Baxter]]'s ''The Saints' Everlasting Rest'' became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation. Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses, that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible. By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).

Soon Puritan ministers like [[Edward Taylor]] began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both [[allegorical]] of the greater glory of God. [[Anne Bradstreet]] provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God. Using the [[analogy]] of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the early allegoric technique with a more [[symbol]]ic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57). 

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay ''Nature'' (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible. He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use simply relying on their [[imagination]]. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).

The method of the three main steps (composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation. Leading modernist poets like [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] began to fragmentarize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12). Postmodernist poets like [[John Ashbery]] deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the [[reference]] of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving [[narrative]] or [[Episode|episodic]] structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation. 

Meditative poetry has often been correlated to [[Relaxation Through Poetry]], which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need. It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.

{{Wikisource|Mrs Warren's Profession}}
'''''Mrs. Warren's Profession''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902. The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam ([[brothel]] proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a [[problem play]], offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'', about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities.

==Summary==

The story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current [[brothel]] owner, is described as "on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old [[wikt:blackguard|blackguard]] of a woman." Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

==Plot==

Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with honours in Mathematics (equal Third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.

==Characters==

*'''Mrs. Kitty Warren''': An attractive, middle-aged businesswoman and former prostitute, made wealthy by running a string of brothels.
*'''Mr. Praed''': A friend of Mrs. Warren, middle-aged and attractive, a good man.
*'''Sir George Crofts''': Mrs. Warren's business partner. A middle-aged, stodgy, entitled member of the upper class.
*'''Reverend Samuel Gardner''': A local minister and (possibly) Vivie's biological father.
*'''Vivie Warren''': Mrs. Warren's daughter, recently graduated from university with honours.
*'''Frank Gardner''': Youthful son of Reverend Gardner.

==Origins==
Shaw said he wrote the play "to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge companion to Victorian and Edwardian theatre |first=Kerry |last=Powell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICi7QY_VSA8C&amp;pg=PA229 |page=229 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-79536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explained the source of the play in a letter to the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' on 28 April 1898:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss [[Janet Achurch]] [an actress and friend of Shaw’s] mentioned to me a novel by some [[French people|French]] writer [''Yvette'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]]] as having a dramatisable story in it. It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability—one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class—not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene—which a baby could write if its sight were normal—in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'' (hence the title, ''Mrs Warren's Profession''), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mrs. Warren's Profession Study Guide| work =| pages =25–26| publisher =Guthrie Theater| year =2003| url =http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-14| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071031110511/http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a note in Cornell University Library's archive, playwright George Bernard Shaw referred to Evans as "the most artistic of photographers."]]
The play was originally banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s official theatre [[Censorship|censor]]) because of its frank discussion of [[prostitution]], but was finally performed on Sunday, 5 January 1902, at [[London]]'s New Lyric Club with the distinguished actor-manager [[Harley Granville-Barker]] as Frank, [[Fanny Brough]] as Mrs. Warren, George Goodhart as Sir George Crofts, Julius Knight as Praed, Madge McIntosh as Vivie and Cosmo Stuart as Rev. Samuel Gardner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3qaAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Mrs.+Warren's+Profession%22+1902+cast#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession: A Play in Four Acts|first=Bernard|last=Shaw|date=8 April 2018|publisher=A.

The first public performance in London took place in 1925.

A 1905 performance in [[New York City|New York]], this time on a public stage, was interrupted by the [[NYPD|police]], who arrested the cast and crew for violating New York City's version of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold Daley Held for his Shaw Play |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1905 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96493562/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later held not to be in violation of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Court Approves Bernard Shaw's Play |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 7, 1906 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96637422/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been revived on Broadway five times since.

The play has been twice revived by the National Theatre, first in 1970-71 at the Old Vic, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Coral Browne and Sarah Badel, and more recently at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1985-86, directed by Anthony Page, with Joan Plowright and Jessica Turner as Mrs Warren and Vivie.

The [[Shaw Festival]] at [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]] has mounted the play five times since the Festival's inception in 1962: 1976, 1990, 1997, 2008, and 2016 

In 2006, it was revived off-broadway by [[Irish Repertory Theatre|The Irish Repertory Theatre]], with [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. Warren, Laura Odeh as Vivie Warren, and [[David Staller]] as Mr. Praed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishrep.org/show/2005-2006-season/mrs-warrens-profession/|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession - Irish Repertory Theatre|author=|date=|website=irishrep.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived in 2010 in three separate venues:

* London's West End, at the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[Felicity Kendal]] in the title role
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], by the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] at [[Sidney Harman Hall]], with [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in the title role
* [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] under the auspices of the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], with [[Cherry Jones]] as Kitty Warren and [[Sally Hawkins]] as Vivie

It was performed by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in 2012, and was so popular that the season was extended.

In 2016 the play was performed at the Center Theatre in Seattle.

In 2018, Eleanor Bishop's adaptation of the play was performed at the ASB Waterfront Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand by the Auckland Theatre Company.

==Sequel==
Sir [[Harry Johnston]] wrote a sequel, a novel entitled ''Mrs. Warren's Daughter'', circa 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15380|title=Mrs. Warren's Daughter: A Story of the Woman's Movement by Harry Johnston|author=|date=|website=gutenberg.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A 1960 German film adaption, ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession (film)|Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'', starred [[Lilli Palmer]].

BBC Television produced a television version first broadcast on 3 October, 1972 on [[BBC2]] under the 'Stage 2' drama strand.&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fce706d308d34b28935c4c64df0c7666&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Cedric Messina]] and directed by [[Herbert Wise]], it starred [[Coral Browne]] in the title role, with [[Penelope Wilton]] as Vivie. Also in the cast were [[James Grout]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] and [[Derek Godfrey]]. Under the ''[[Play of the Month]]'' strand, the production was repeated on [[BBC1]] on 21 April, 1974&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/66c1ecd4a77a4700ace420bc4b92aad1&lt;/ref&gt;. The production was released on DVD in 2006.

A radio adaptation was broadcast on the [[BBC]] in 2002, and re-broadcast in January 2009 on [[BBC Radio 7]], starring [[Maggie Steed]] in the title role.

==Vivie's character and the changing role of women==

Men who could afford to get married in the Victorian era could make use of “laws that gave him total control of his wife's person—and her fortune”.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Dan H. "Victorians Unveiled: Some Thoughts on Mrs. Warren’s Profession". Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies 24 (2004): 40. Retrieved 2010-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian women were expected to maintain a poised and dignified manner, and to obey their husbands. Vivie defies the Victorian expectations of an obedient woman: she is educated and entirely self-sufficient. She rejects two marriage proposals, reflecting her reliance on her work ethic and hard-headed approach to life. Shaw represents Vivie as the product of a type of gender reformation: a character who is asexual and "permanently unromantic".&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Warren's Profession", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Twentieth Century and Beyond'' (eds. Joseph Black, et al.) Canada: Broadview, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the play, the boundary between sexual desires and proposed marriages is blurred. Frank flirts with both Mrs. Warren and Vivie; Mrs. Warren's companion Sir George Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie despite his relationship with her mother. Critic Petra Dierkes-Thrun argues that these examples illustrate the way in which Shaw "critiqued the ideological and economic system that produced her [Mrs. Warren], attacking the problematic double standard of [[male privilege]] and the deeply entrenched objectification of women, which Shaw saw pervading all levels of Victorian society down to its most basic nuclear element, the family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://z3950.muse.jhu.edu/journals/english_literature_in_transition/related/v049/49.3.dierkes-thrun.html Dierkes-Thrun, Petra].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of old wives' tales ==

'''Painting in Space''' ("Les Peintures dans l`espace" in French) is an [[art movement]] that was invented by [[Yervand Kochar]] in the 1930s in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenianweekly.com/2010/11/14/komitas-and-kochar-the-music-and-image-of-undefeated-spirit/|title=Komitas and Kochar: The Music and Image of Undefeated Spirit|date=2010-11-14|work=The Armenian Weekly|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement syntheses all the possibilities of painting, graphic and sculpture. 

== About ==
Painting in Space consists of different metal panels with various paintings. With the help of an engine situated in the base of the figure it is being viewed in slow motion. This way [[Yervand Kochar]] shows how in time separate space elements become one, breaking the boundaries of time and space. It is not a sculpture, but painting in motion. Kochar proposes to expand the possibilities of visual thinking, introducing motion into frozen forms, blending painting with the plasticity of three-dimensional geometric forms.

One work of the Painting in Space works, aptly named ''Les Peintures dans l`espace'', (1934) by [[Yervand Kochar]], is being exhibited and in the permanent collection at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cej9p9e/rgkBe7|title=Collection: Peinture dans l'espace|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Centre Pompidou|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction. Dividing line?|last1= Ritchie|first1= James|author2= Tog|author3= Gleason, Bill|author4= Lopresti, Rob|author5= Andrews, Dale|author6= Baker, Jeff|date= 2009-12-29|work= The Mystery Place|publisher= Ellery Queen, Alfred Hitchock, Dell Magazines|accessdate= 2010-01-10|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

'''Physical art''', as contrasted with [[conceptual art]], refers to art that [[concrete]]ly exists in physical [[reality]], in [[space]] and [[time]].  Its [[ontology|ontological]] status is that it is a [[physical object]].  The art is [[concrete]]ly realized but may be [[abstract art|abstract]] in nature.  For example, a painting, sculpture, or performance exists in the physical world.  This is contrasted to [[conceptual art]], some but not all kinds of [[performance art]], [[Aesthetics|computer software]], or objects of [[mathematical beauty]], such as a [[mathematical proof]], which do not exist in the [[mental world]] or in [[physical world]], but have other ontological status, such as in [[Plato]]'s world of [[Platonic ideal|ideals]].  Here, the art, may be ''realized'' in the physical world, such as a [[mathematical proof]] written on a chalkboard, but refer to objects that [[existence|exists]] in the [[mind]] as [[concept]]s, not physical objects.  A [[music]] performance is physical, while the composition, like computer software, is not.&lt;ref name=Leo2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|title=A Taxonomy of Abstract Form Using Studies of Synesthesia and Hallucinations|journal=Leonardo|date=February 2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''Post-romanticism''' or '''Postromanticism''' refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of [[Romanticism]].

[[Herman Melville]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are post-Romantic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milder, ''Exiled Royalties: Melville and the Life We Imagine'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|0-19-514232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' is a post-Romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Heath, ''Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary'', Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13. {{ISBN|0-521-31483-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Baumback and others, "A History of British Poetry", Trier: WVT. {{ISBN|978-3-86821-578-6}}. Section 19: Poetic Genres in the Victorian Age I: Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Post-Romantic Verse Narratives by Anne-Julia Zwierlein.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', New York: Routledge, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;134. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Romanticism in music ==
Post-romanticism in [[music]] referred to [[romantic music|Romantic]] composers who would use [[musical form|forms]] that were found typically in the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are [[Puccini|Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninov]]. [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]]&lt;!--in an interview with Virgil Thomson--&gt; describes the mysticism of [[La Jeune France]] as post-Romanticism rather than [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Thomson,. ''Virgil Thomson: A Reader: Selected Writings, 1924-1984'', edited by Richard Kostelanetz, New York: Routledge, 2002p.&amp;nbsp;268. {{ISBN|0-415-93795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Pfitzner]] also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera ''Palestrina''.

Quite unlike Late Romantic composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and [[harmony]]. [[Béla Bartók]], for example, "in such Strauss-influenced works as ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''," may be described as having still used "[[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound"—unlike [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Strauss himself, who both believed in "a mythology of historical progress in Western music".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright,. ''Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources'',  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004pp.&amp;nbsp;243-44. {{ISBN|0-226-01267-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Powerhouse Arts District''' is a historic warehouse district in [[Downtown Jersey City|Downtown]] [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]], which takes its name from the unused generating station [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse]] currently undergoing an extensive stabilization effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml/ Warehouse Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611052218/http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml |date=2008-06-11 }}

Part of what was once called the [[Horseshoe, Jersey City|Horseshoe Section]],  the neighborhood's informal borders are [[Newport, Jersey City|Newport]] to the north, [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]] to the east, [[Paulus Hook]] to the south and [[Harsimus Cove]] to the west. 

The landmarked [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse]] is at Provost St. between 1st and Bay Sts ({{coord|40|43|16|N|74|2|25|W|name=Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse}}). The [[Pavonia-Newport (HBLR station)|Pavonia-Newport]], [[Harsimus Cove (HBLR station)|Harsimus Cove]], and [[Harborside Financial Center (HBLR station)|Harborside]] stations of the [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]], and the [[Grove Street (PATH station)|Grove Street]] station of the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] system are nearby.

==WALDO and PAD==
[[File:Great-a-p-warehouse-jersey-city.jpg|thumb|left|The A &amp; P Warehouse]]
'''WALDO''' was the name of a planning strategy adopted into Jersey City zoning in 2002 per a proposal written by the [[Urban Land Institute]], and was deleted from the zoning on January 24, 2007. As the name implies, the purpose was to most effectively re-use an eight block area of industrial buildings, and transition them to include more residences, without zoning them a purely residential use. Currently, most zoning codes do not allow industrial and residential uses to co-exist on the same lot. The district also aimed at retaining the high bulk, low rise industrial buildings which were threatened by development of high rise towers in the area.

The plan indicated that roughly half of the apartments built in the existing industrial buildings in the eight block neighborhood must go to artists. Under the district plan, two industrial buildings were renovated into loft apartments, and one new building, Waldo Lofts, was constructed. During the district's lifespan, there were several attempts to bring in more housing and studios for artists, to make the area more pedestrian friendly, and to bring in art schools or museums.  There were also been proposals to turn the Powerhouse into residences, shops, galleries, and museum space.

Most of the proposals for retail and gallery space never materialized or found tenants, and as a result the eight blocks of industrial buildings remain much the same as in 2002 when the district began. As well, the city approved new zoning for a large development on First Street which deviated from the district plan.  New zoning is proposed for several other blocks. Most proposed developments are higher rise structures, and the majority of capital investment in the district favors high rise development. These factors led to WALDO being removed from the zoning ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/nyregion/15towns.html|title=Adjusting Vision of Waterfront Arts District to Include High Rises|date=15 May 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waldo Yards==
The term Waldo has been used before the zoning plan was introduced. Waldo Avenue is named for Samuel Waldo who built and owned three attached brownstone homes located on the NW corner of Magnolia and Waldo Avenues.  Today, the three structures still stand.The avenue which runs south from [[Newark Plank Road|Newark Avenue]] to "[[Hilltop, Jersey City|The Island]]" a remnant outcropping of [[Bergen Hill]], which in turn overlooks the Waldo Yards, originally used by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] [[Jersey City Branch]], and now by [[Port Authority Trans Hudson]] mass transit trains.

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'', 1874, by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], portrayed by [[Jane Morris]]]]
The '''Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ''' (later known as the '''Pre-Raphaelites''') was a group of [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]]s, [[poets]], and [[art critic]]s, founded in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The three founders were joined by [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[James Collinson]], [[Frederic George Stephens]] and [[Thomas Woolner]] to form the seven-member "brotherhood". Their principles were shared by other artists, including [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[Marie Spartali Stillman]].

A later, medievalising strain inspired by Rossetti included [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and extended into the twentieth century with artists such as [[John William Waterhouse]].

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what it considered the mechanistic approach first adopted by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Its members believed the [[Classicism|Classical]] poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the [[academic art|academic]] teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". In particular, the group objected to the influence of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], founder of the English [[Royal Academy of Arts]], whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Timothy (1970).  ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 46.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brotherhood sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian art. The group associated their work with [[John Ruskin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landow|first1=George P.|title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

The group continued to accept the concepts of [[history painting]] and [[mimesis]], imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the ''Pre-Raphaelite Journal''.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Germ.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Holman Hunt of Thomas Woolner's poem "My Beautiful Lady", published in ''The Germ'', 1850]]
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais's parents' house on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[William Holman Hunt]] were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of [[Ford Madox Brown]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=McGann&gt;McGann, Jerome J. ''The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', NINES consortium, Creative Commons License; http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s40.rap.html retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in [[Cleveland Street, London|Cleveland Street]], [[Fitzrovia]], Central London. Hunt had started painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'' based on [[The Eve of St. Agnes|Keats's poem of the same name]], but it was not completed until 1867.&lt;ref name=hilton28&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters [[James Collinson]] and [[Frederic George Stephens]], Rossetti's brother, poet and critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and  sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood.&lt;ref name=hilton28/&gt; Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to ''The Germ''. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including [[Charles Allston Collins]], and [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hisour.com/art-movements/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-1848-1855/|title=Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1848 - 1855 - HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|date=2017-02-22|work=HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood's early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading&lt;!-- "parading" NOT "parodying" --&gt; and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Latham, pp. 11-12; see also his comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by [[medieval]] culture, believing it to possess a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]]. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their [[idealism]] to the [[materialism|materialist]] realism associated with [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Impressionism]].

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of [[bitumen]] by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] and [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]]. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites&lt;/ref&gt;

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais's ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Isabella]]'' (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt's ''[[Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions|Rienzi]]'' (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy.  Rossetti's ''[[:File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 004.jpg|Girlhood of Mary Virgin]]'' was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials "PRB". Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, ''The Germ'' edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as [[Coventry Patmore]]. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'', by John Everett Millais, 1850]]
In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais' painting ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] by many reviewers, notably [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens'', p. 309. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens considered Millais' Mary to be ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Sophia (2005). ''The Pre-Raphaelite Art of the Victorian Novel: Narrative Challenges to Visual Gendered Boundaries'', p. 9. Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood's  medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 3 May 1851; pg. 8; Issue 20792: Exhibition of the Royal Academy. (Private View.), First Notice: ''"We cannot censure at present, as amply or as strongly as we desire to do, that strange disorder of the mind or the eyes which continues to rage with unabated absurdity among a class of juvenile artists who style themselves "P.R.B.," which being interpreted means ''Pre-Raphael Brethren''. Their faith seems to consist in an absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade, an aversion to beauty in every shape, and a singular devotion to the minute accidents of their subjects, including, or rather seeking out, every excess of sharpness and deformity."''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd "medieval" poses. A rival group of older artists, [[The Clique]], used its influence against the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its principles were publicly attacked by the President of the Academy, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the controversy, Collinson left the brotherhood and the remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or [[Walter Howell Deverell]], but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works "PRB".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'', by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The brotherhood found support from the critic [[John Ruskin]], who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as [[Effie Gray]]). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, James S. (1999). ''John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures'', pp. 36–37. Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Effie became increasingly attached to Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, pp. 49–94.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-[[consummation]], leaving Effie free to marry Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Dearden (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved,&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Michael |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of art terms - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=9780199569922}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term "Pre-Raphaelite" stuck to Rossetti and others, including [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], with whom he became involved in [[Oxford]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Whiteley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteley |first=Jon |title=Oxford and the Pre-Raphaelites |year=1989 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |location=Oxford |isbn=0907849946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with the much wider and long-lived art movement, including the dreamy, yearning images of women produced by Rossetti and several of his followers.

==Later developments and influence==
[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Medea]]'' by Evelyn De Morgan, 1889, in [[quattrocento]] style]]
Artists influenced by the brotherhood include [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[Philip Calderon]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Evelyn De Morgan]],&lt;ref name=hilton202&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Sandys]] (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857)&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt; and [[John William Waterhouse]]. [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]], who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt;

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models like [[Jane Morris]], in paintings such as ''Proserpine'', ''The Blue Silk Dress'', and ''La Pia de' Tolomei''. His work influenced his friend [[William Morris]], in whose firm [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris's company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in [[medieval]] designs and other crafts leading to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the [[Della Robbia Pottery]] company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.

[[File:The Death of King Arthur by James Archer (1860).jpg|thumb|left|James Archer, ''The Death of King Arthur'', 1860]]
Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821-1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823-1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fineartbookstore.com/s-120-Pre-Raphaelites|title=Fine Art Books Art Instruction {{!}} Photography Books {{!}} Visual Arts Periods, Groups &amp; Movements: Pre-Raphaelites|last=|first=|date=|website=fineartbookstore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century. Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. In the late 20th century the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] and the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] have also derived inspiration from it.

[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bucher (2004) for a brief discussion on the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites.
[[File:Arthur Hughes - Fair Rosamund - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], ''Fair Rosamund'', 1854]]
In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. Since the Pre-Raphaelites were fixed on portraying things with near-photographic precision, though with a distinctive attention to detailed surface-patterns, their work was devalued by many painters and critics. After the [[First World War]], British [[Modernism|Modernists]] associated Pre-Raphaelite art with the repressive and backward times in which they grew up. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London's [[Tate Gallery]], re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work.&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, Tim (1999). ''Reading the Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 17. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at [[Tate Britain]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde ''Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde''], Tate Britain, accessed 27 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the ‘inner’ Pre-Raphaelite circle ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]) and ‘outer’ circle ([[Frederick Sandys]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Simeon Solomon]], [[Henry Hugh Armstead]], [[Joseph Noel Paton]], [[Frederic Shields]], [[Matthew James Lawless]]) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Illustration: The Pre-Raphaelites, the Idyllic School and the High Victorians|last=Goldman|first=Paul|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=2004|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=1–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its “noble grounds for noble emotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: “The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Robert W.|date=October 1871|title=The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D.G. Rossetti|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=|pages=|via=}} as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize [[subject painting]], which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the [[Sister Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/1.1.html|title=Chapter One: Ruskin's Theories of the Sister Arts — Ut Pictura Poesis|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter from D.G. Rossetti to William Allingham|last=Rossetti|first=Dante Gabriel|work=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1855, Rossetti wrote to [[William Allingham]] about the independence of illustration: “I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the ‘Vision of Sin’ and ‘Palace of Art’ etc. – those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This passage makes apparent Rossetti’s desire to not just support the poet’s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==
[[File:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'', 1851]]
There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Tate Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]], [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], and Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones' ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'', [[Frederic Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Flaming June]]'', and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and [[Frederic Sandys]].

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the [[Oxford Union]], depicting scenes from the [[Arthurian legend]]s, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones.  The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] houses at [[Wightwick Manor]], [[Wolverhampton]], and at [[Wallington Hall]], [[Northumberland]], both have significant and representative collections. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 2003.

[[Kelmscott Manor]], the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris' work ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. It also appears in the background of [[Water Willow (Rossetti)|''Water Willow'']], a portrait of his wife, [[Jane Morris]], painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in 1871.  There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti’s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two [[BBC]] television series. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' by [[Peter Bowker]]. Although much of the latter's material is derived from [[Franny Moyle]]'s factual book ''Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/25/romantics.shtml Desperate Romantics press pack: introduction] ''BBC Press Office''. Retrieved on 24 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: "In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC2 drama on icons among Pre-Raphaelites |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6626470.ece|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Russell]]'s television film ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by [[Oliver Reed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15191">'''Relational art''' or '''relational aesthetics''' is a mode or tendency in [[fine art]] practice originally observed and highlighted by French art critic [[Nicolas Bourriaud]]. Bourriaud defined the approach as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p.113&lt;/ref&gt; The artist can be more accurately viewed as the "catalyst" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origin of the term==
{{Main article|Traffic (art exhibition)}}
One of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of relational art&lt;ref&gt;As a term, "relational art" has become accepted over "relational aesthetics" by the art world and Bourriaud himself as indicated by the 2002 exhibition ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'' at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], curated by Bourriaud.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book ''Esthétique relationnelle'' (''Relational Aesthetics'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition ''[[Traffic (art exhibition)|Traffic]]'' curated by Bourriaud at [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bennett. "Public Relations: Nicolas Bourriaud Interview."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Traffic'' included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as [[Henry Bond]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Liam Gillick]], Christine Hill, [[Carsten Höller]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Miltos Manetas]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Philippe Parreno]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film ''[[Trafic]]''(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a ''denoument'' that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.&lt;ref name="Bishop pp.54-55"&gt;Bishop, Claire. "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Relational Aesthetics'', pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Traffic, Catalogue Capc Bordeaux'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutualart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/TRAFFIC-CONTROL/FBC1A92B4838F138|title=TRAFFIC CONTROL|author=|date=|website=www.mutualart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relational aesthetics''===
Bourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases "to take shelter behind Sixties art history",&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p.7&lt;/ref&gt; and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s [[internet]] boom, using terminology such as [[user-friendliness]], [[interactivity]] and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 book ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', Bourriaud describes ''Relational Aesthetics'' as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, Caroline Schneider and Jeanine Herman. ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Art===
Bourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space." The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims "the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at [[New York University]], coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are "that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered." The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Keywords in Subversive Film / Media Aesthetics| last = Stam| first = Robert| publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year = 2015| isbn = 1118340612| location = |page = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated ''collectively'', rather than in the space of individual consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writer and director [[Ben Lewis (writer)|Ben Lewis]] has suggested that relational art is the new "ism", in analogue with "ism"s of earlier periods such as [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", published in 2004 in ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', [[Claire Bishop]] describes the aesthetic of [[Palais de Tokyo]] as a "laboratory", the "curatorial modus operandi" of art produced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop writes, "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As [[Hal Foster]] warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of [[poststructuralist]] theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.”&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop also asks, "if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what ''types'' of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She continues that "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically [[democracy|democratic]], as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of [[subjectivity]] as whole and of community as immanent togetherness."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Traffic Control", published one year later in ''[[Artforum]]'', artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, "Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics."

==Exhibitions==
In 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'', "an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/i1_a/2003_02_25_i1_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Nicolas Bourriaud and Karen Moss |website=Stretcher.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibited artists included [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Jens Haaning]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Gillian Wearing]] and [[Andrea Zittel]]. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's "snapshot" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating "different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb |first=Chris |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r3_a/2002_11_13_r3_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Touch - Relational Art from the 1990’s to Now |website=Stretcher.org |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show ''Theanyspacewhatever''. The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/anyspace/exhibition.html|title=theanyspacewhatever|author=|date=|website=web.guggenheim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentimental poetry''' is a [[melodramatic]] [[poetic form]]. It is aimed primarily at stimulating the [[emotion]]s rather than at communicating experience truthfully. [[Grief|Bereavement]] is a common theme of sentimental poetry. 

[[Friedrich Schiller]] discussed sentimental poetry in his influential essay, ''[[On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry]]''.

Sentimental poetry was parodied by [[Mark Twain]] in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Annie|title=The Poetess in American Literature|url=http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-472#acrefore-9780190201098-e-472-div1-1201|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Short prose''' is a generic term for various kinds of very short [[fictional]] [[prose]]; short prose may or may not be [[narrative]]. Short prose pieces are considerably shorter than a [[short story]], i.e., usually less than c. 1,000 words. Because of their small size, short prose pieces can attain high levels of lexical density and may thereby resemble [[prose poetry|prose poems]], but the focus in short prose is less on language itself (and thus on [[rhythm]], metre, or other phonological effects) than on the rapid presentation of a situation.

A piece of short prose may contain [[drama]], but it normally differs from a [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] in that it has no necessary associations with theatre or character. Because [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is peripheral to, or nonexistent in, short prose, a short prose piece differs from a [[sketch story]] in that it does not necessarily invite the reader to imagine what came before or what follows after. Finally, because a piece of short prose does not necessarily have characters, conflict, or resolution, it usually differs from the [[short short story]], [[flash fiction]] and [[microfiction]] as these are usually defined.

Writers who have favoured the use of short prose include [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Daniil Kharms]] (Случаи), [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[István Örkény]] (''Egyperces novellák''), Samuel Beckett ([[Fizzles]]), [[Francis Ponge]] (''[[Le parti pris des choses]]''), [[David Eggers]] (''[[Short Short Stories]]''),  [[Eduardo Berti]] (''[[La Vie Impossible]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Spectrophilia''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[ghost]]s or [[sexual arousal]] from images in [[mirror]]s, as well as the alleged phenomenon of sexual encounters between [[ghost]]s and [[human]]s.

==Spectrophilia as a fetish==
Spectrophilia is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] that is classified as the [[paraphilia]] in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits.

==Succubus and Incubus==
In western folklore, the [[succubus]] is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. 

The counterpart of the succubus is the [[incubus]]. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen.&lt;ref name="csicop1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Stollznow|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/paranormal_paramours |title=CSI &amp;#124; Paranormal Paramours |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia.

==Spectrophilia in folklore==
Many cultures have [[folklore]] involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]], [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Hindu culture|Hindu]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.

==Evidence==
No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], including [[Ghost Adventures]] and the [[Travel Channel]]'s show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/who-are-these-ghostly-lovers-11635 |title=Who are these ghostly lovers? : Video |publisher=Travel Channel |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fiction==
Several films have dealt with the concept, among them ''[[The Entity]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghost_(1990_film)|Ghost]]'' (1990) , Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia (2008) and ''[[It Follows]]'' (2014).

'''Subtext''' or '''undertone''' is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of [[metaphor]]. Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is content underneath the [[spoken dialogue|dialogue]]. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, [[anger]], [[competition]], [[pride]], showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and [[Base motive|motives]] of characters — what they really think and believe. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to [[censorship]] or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may include a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, science fiction and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in [[suspension of disbelief]].

Subtext includes information about the period and culture in which the author of a book is writing that may not be deliberately articulated but is conveyed through the text in speech, social customs or historical details. 

A more recently coined term, '''metamessage''' is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext.&lt;ref name="Ballon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Ballon|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sSIF2PMmEC&amp;pg=PT240|year=2009|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-342-6|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1112|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metamessage'' is a term more commonly used in the analysis of [[business communication]] rather than of literary works.&lt;ref name="LohmannLohmann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger A. Lohmann|author2=Nancy Lohmann|title=Social Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JpY07RJXqkC&amp;pg=PT225|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50261-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

==Definition==
The author [[David Baboulene]], in his practical academic work on story theory, ''The Story Book'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Baboulene| first = David| title = ''The Story Book - Guidance for writers on story creation, optimisation and problem resolution''| edition = 1st| year = 2010| publisher = DreamEngine Media Ltd| isbn = 978-0-9557089-2-3| pages = 256 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines subtext as "the result of any form of gap in knowledge between any of the participants in a story; for example, between the author and a character, between two characters or between the audience and at least one character."

An example occurs in the 1978 movie [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]. Lois Lane has just met Clark Kent. The subtext is that she has taken an instant dislike to him. At the surface, however, their conversation seems only to solicit and supply information about the existence of others of Clark Kent's type.  "Any more at home like you?" she inquires. "Uh, not really, no", Clark replies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = ''[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt] http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt, View source lines 1718-1722''}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Examples ==
In the play ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], subtext is important in gaining a greater understanding of the characters, as they cannot always speak freely due to the constrictions of social conventions at the time.

A scene in [[Woody Allen]]'s movie ''[[Annie Hall]]'', in which [[subtitles]] explain the characters' inner thoughts during an apparently innocent conversation, is an example of the subtext of a scene being made explicit.

Victorian novels may feature confining social norms such as strict marriage conventions, taboos against births out of wedlock, inheritance to first born sons, etc., that form the subtext of plot and character. These issues can be deployed unconsciously, as in [[Wilkie Collins]]' "The Woman in White" or as part of a concealed critique of gender politics, as in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s "Jane Eyre".

In the episode "My Best Friend's Bottom" of the British comedy TV series ''[[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]]'', "Captain Subtext" is a tool used in the narrative to explicitly make the viewers aware of the subtextual message in the dialogue. In it, the dialogue and the subtext have been deliberately made humorous.

Television sci-fi such as the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (both of which implicitly avoided onscreen sexual situations) have often been discussed with respect to certain scenes or lines of dialogue.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Cues for the subtext are sometimes given in the main text in the form of ''intertexts'', which are [[allusion]]s to the themes of other texts. An example is ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which can be interpreted as containing numerous biblical (intertextual) allusions, framing the subtext as a religiously inspired theme—the search for the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and the meaning of life beyond physical existence.&lt;ref name="Danesi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Messages, Signs, and Meanings: A Basic Textbook in Semiotics and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDI4mBnS8OoC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-250-8|page=142|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political use==
Historians have often identified an anticipated future revolution, often without the ruling party's understanding.

Such an example of the power and controversy of subtexts might include the deliverance theme pervasive in the songs, stories, and symbols of the slaves in the United States up through the [[Civil Rights]] era and, perhaps, still today. The slave prayers, with their theme of deliverance, may have seemed subversive, as striking at planter ideology and control &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DhlT0z9DX3cC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=slavery+deliverance+subtext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sR3Zu9t2Pq&amp;sig=DPczMb3EAQxtXp21ktJfQ0X1lC0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ogy4Us7CEoqihgf86oD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20deliverance%20subtext&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtext messages have seen fairly widespread use as a way to combat [[censorship]] in literary works, for example in the former [[Communist bloc]].&lt;ref name="Vianu1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lidia Vianu|title=Censorship in Romania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eDddelzL0oC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1998|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-09-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is of course much older; e.g. one find works from the [[middle ages]] criticizing the church establishment. Some of these works use a formal technique called ''double structure'' in which the same text can have different (usually antithetical) meanings by reading sentences or verses in two different orders.&lt;ref name="Shuger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Debora Shuger|title=Censorship and Cultural Sensibility: The Regulation of Language in Tudor-Stuart England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66zotoM7eMsC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2006|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0334-8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metamessage ==
{{see also|meta-communication}}
According to a 2008 [[organizational communication]] textbook, ''meta message'' is a term coined by lawyer [[Gerard Nierenberg]] in his 1995 book ''The Art of Negotiating'' to denote (in the words of the textbook) "those messages that are conveyed between the lines of what we explicitly say or write, possibly due to the purpose, context, or timing of the message and/or the relationship between the people communicating".&lt;ref name="BlundelIppolito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Blundel|author2=Kate Ippolito|title=Effective Organisational Communication: Perspectives, Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jxrepUBc5wC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-71375-3|page=10|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also appears in a 1972 book of [[Gregory Bateson]], who suggested a somewhat similar distinction, although in the form of a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so on.&lt;ref name="Bateson1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Bateson|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HewJbnQmn1gC&amp;pg=PA247|year=1972|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3|pages=247–248 and 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson argued that any message needs to be interpreted in the [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] established by a superordinate message cueing how the textual message is intended.&lt;ref name="Tannen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Deborah Tannen]]|title=Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk among Friends|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988515-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Wolfe]] points out that Bateson's concepts and terminlogy are rather technical, and are thus commonly misinterpreted. In particular, in Bateson's work the metamessage is the framing message, not the actual (subtext) meaning assigned to the subordinate message in the context of the framing message.&lt;ref name="Wolfe1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wolfe|title=Marginalized in the Middle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vdSwzN74qgC&amp;pg=PT204|date=January 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90517-4|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two decades before introducing the metamessage terminology into his works, Bateson studied by what "mood sign[al]" (his earlier term for metamessage) subordinated messages are interpreted "seriously, jokingly, sarcastically, as gestures of friendliness, as acts of aggression" etc. Invoking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Logical Types]], Bateson proposed that for every signal, there is always signal level above it which precisely determines its interpretation. Bateson's theory was however criticized as too rigid and lacking explanatory power for real-world communication phenomena in which signals of any kind (at any level) can be deceitful.&lt;ref name="Jones1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Jones|title=Communication and Meaning: An Essay in Applied Modal Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGYoAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-1543-2|pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metamessages can be delivered by a wide variety of means, including [[verbal modifier]]s (like "certainly", "only", "just", etc.),&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew McKay|author2=Martha Davis|author3=Patrick Fanning|title=Messages: The Communication Skills Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XsPAEpOiUgC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-853-3|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and—in spoken communication—by [[paralanguage]],&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"/&gt; e.g. by [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] and [[Pitch accent|pitch]].&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"/&gt; Metamessages can also be conveyed by [[body language]].&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Lefevre|title=Communicating with Children and Young People: Making a Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNv6zH437C0C&amp;pg=PA46|year=2010|publisher=The Policy Press|isbn=978-1-84742-282-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous pipe image from ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' with the subtitle "ceci n'est pas une pipe" (meaning "this is not a pipe") is sometimes given as an example of metamessage conveyed by paralanguage.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Language, Volume 28, Issues 1-2, J. Benjamins 2004, p. 247, {{doi| 10.1075/sl.28.1.14hai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol features three [[hare]]s or [[rabbit]]s chasing each other in a circle. Like the [[triskelion]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"/&gt; the [[triquetra]], and their antecedents (e.g., the [[triple spiral]]), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold [[rotational symmetry]]. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]]. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the [[Trinity]]. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

Another appears on an ancient Islamic-made [[reliquary]] from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in [[Iran]] under [[Mongol]] rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the [[Cathedral of Trier]] in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares.

One theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the [[silk road]] and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive [[Chinese ceramics|Oriental ceramics]]. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puzzle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | title=The Three Rabbits and Similar Puzzles | author=Singmaster, David |date = August 2004| accessdate=November 11, 2008| publisher=threehares.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918164613/http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | archivedate=18 September 2008 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin miners]] adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/three_hares.htm | title=The Tinner's Rabbits | author=Sandles, Tim | publisher=Legendary Dartmoor | date=23 November 2007 | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ornament (architecture)|architectural ornament]] of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England.  Other occurrences in England include floor tiles at [[Chester Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7gmsuBKphC0J:www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/visiting/heritage/archaeology/idoc.ashx%3Fdocid%3Da1e344d2-e034-4e75-be85-98ed4ece781f%26version%3D-1+three+hares+chester&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgMqXBfw-mvBT3_AZ5KnzDpUjwT5pik-gSyTJI6wpQXn4Od5hI10k54W8sUz9qhk-acrzKxQAWpiY7q1Bq8FQExwnvVsWobptu9pvl3a84IMS8dra-D4mghOq4E-Cch5GefRNTM&amp;sig=AHIEtbRIEWcY1KRQp2amOyhcsuPLrEwDcQ | title=The archaeology of Cheshire West and Chester in ten objects }}&lt;/ref&gt; stained glass at [[Long Melford]], Suffolk&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;At the [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]], above the northern door, is a small stained glass [[roundel]], only a few inches in diameter.  {{cite web|url=http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|title=The three hares window: a medieval mystery|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918035853/http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|archivedate=18 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ceiling in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

==In Christianity==
The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval European churches, particularly in France (''e.g.'', in the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]] in [[Lyon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourhares.com/ |title=Three Hares at Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, four hares, and three hares and three wolves, elsewhere. photographs and drawing |publisher=Fourhares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of [[Devon]], England. The motif appears in [[illuminated manuscripts]],&lt;ref name="|Terrier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trois-lievres.skyrock.com/ |title=Three hares and their ears commune (''Trois lièvres à oreilles communes'') |first2=Tom (Archaeologist and historian)|last2=Greeves |first3=Sue (researcher)|last3=Andrew |first1=Michel |last1=Terrier |language=French |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; architectural [[wood carving]], [[stone carving]], window [[tracery]] and [[stained glass]]. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on '[[roof boss]]es' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] churches in [[Devon]], (particularly [[Dartmoor]]). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widecombe-in-the-moor.com/history/minutes/2005/the_three_hares.php |first1=Tom, Dr. |last1=Greeves |first2=Sue |last2=Andrews |first3=Chris |last3=Chapman |title=From China to Widecombe: The Extraordinary Journey of The Three Hares |publisher=Widecombe-in-the-Moor |accessdate=24 April 2012 |date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmoor, with another in the town of [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] on the edge of the moor. The [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt; Another occurrence is on the [[ossuary]] that by tradition contained the bones of [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Shackle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |last1=Shackle |first1=Eric |work=Eric Shackle's e-book |title=Three Hares Share Three Ears |accessdate=24 April 2012 |year=2006 |location=Sydney, Australia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AsPtdXu?url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the [[chancel]] roof, or on a central rib of the [[nave]]. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was [[hermaphrodite]] and could reproduce without loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt; This led to an association with the [[Virgin Mary]], with hares sometimes occurring in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Northern Renaissance|Northern European]] paintings of the Virgin and [[Christ Child]]. The other Christian association may have been with the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threehares.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-three-hares_25.html |title=Three Hares as representation of the Trinity |publisher=Threehares.blogspot.com |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the ''"One in Three and Three in One"'' of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the [[Green Man]], a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Christianity and Paganism|paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |title=Green Men &amp; The Way of All Flesh |first1=Richard |last1=Hayma |accessdate=31 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131231951/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's [[sin]]ful, earthly nature.&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, the "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;In [[Hebrew]], the rock hyrax is called שפן סלע (''shafan sela''), meaning ''rock "shafan"'', where the meaning of ''shafan'' is obscure, but is [[colloquially]] used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. {{cite web|first1=Nosson |last1=Slifkin |authorlink1=Natan Slifkin |work=The camel, the hare &amp; the hyrax: a study of the laws of animals with one kosher sign in light of modern zoology |location=Southfield, MI; [[Nanuet, NY]] |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim Distributed by Feldheim |chapter=6 |title=Shafan–The Hyrax |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |format=PDF |date=1 March 2004 |isbn=1-56871-312-6 |pages=99–135 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|978-1-56871-312-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although rabbits are listed as a non-[[kosher]] animal in the Bible{{mdash}}they at least arguably chew their cud{{efn-ua|Even though they are not a [[ruminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/do-rabbits-really-chew-the-cud/ |title=Do rabbits really chew their cud |work=Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions |volume=2  |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} lacking [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]]{{mdash}}rabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Jewish diaspora]].  The replica of the [[Khodoriv|Chodorow]] [[Synagogue]] from Poland (on display at the [[Beth Hatefutsoth|Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] in [[Tel Aviv]]) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of [[Deuteronomy]]:

{{quote|
:.כנשר יעיר קינו על גוזליו ירחף. יפרוש כנפיו יקחהו ישאהו על אברתו
|Deuteronomy 32:11, [[The Song of Moses]]}}

This may be translated: "As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions  (...thus is [[God]] to the Jewish people)."&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the "rotating rabbits".  An ancient German [[riddle]] describes this graphic thus:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Three hares sharing three ears,
Yet every one of them has two.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous [[wooden synagogues]] from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashknaz]] region (in Germany) that are on museum display in [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] Museum in Tel Aviv, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]  and The [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.  They also appear in the Synagogue from [[Horb am Neckar]] (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from [[Unterlimpurg]] near [[Schwäbisch Hall]], which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: "... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] context".&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the [[Torah ark]], the place where the [[Religious text|holy scriptures]] repose.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

They appear on [[headstones]] in [[Sataniv]] (Сатанів), [[Khmelnytsky Oblast]], western [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ruthellengruber/general_site/Sataniv.html |title=Gruber, Ruth Ellen.

It notes:

:So that we give pleasure to each of you.
:And when we have turned, count our ears,

"These are the oldest known dated examples of the Three Rabbits as a puzzle." One commentator believes its being a puzzle is likely reason for the image's popularity.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

One recent philosophical book poses it as a problem in perception and an [[optical illusion]]—an example of [[contour rivalry]]. Each rabbit can be individually seen as correct—it is only when you try to see all three at once that you see the problem with defining the hares' ears. This is similar to "The Impossible [[Penrose triangle|Tribar]]" by [[Roger Penrose]],&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt; originated by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]]. Compare [[M.C. Escher]]'s [[impossible object]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">The '''two headed alligator''' is a [[Fearsome critters|folkloric animal]] of the [[United States|American]] state of [[Florida]]. Its history is focused mainly within the neighborhood of [[Seminole Heights]] in the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where it appears on the official seal. It is also the subject of art murals, statues, flags, tee-shirts and other ephemera related to the neighborhood.

== Origins ==
[[File:Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave]]
The earliest recorded reference to the two headed alligator was in 1911 when real estate developer, T. Roy Young and his Seminole Development Company purchased 40 acres of land and developed Seminole Heights, Tampa's first suburb. In the promotion of the real estate venture, Young adopted an image of a two headed alligator as part of a neighborhood seal.

A folktale entitled, ''Bite or Smite'', was recorded by R. Perez and A.L. Lopez in 1930 during their research on local superstitions for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writers’ Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]] for the State of Florida. Like many folktales from the region, its characters consist of an anthropomorphic rabbit, alligator and turtle. In the story, the rabbit ignores the warning of the turtle and is eaten by the alligator, who had been concealing a second head. Since it is difficult to date the creation of folklore, it is unclear whether Bite or Smite was the inspiration for, or inspired by, the Seminole Heights seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 Sighting ==
In 2014, a man claiming to be a "local naturalist" sent an image of a two-headed alligator he spotted at a Seminole Heights park to the local newspaper, [[Tampa Bay Times]], who ran the image on the cover of the follow day's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/01/Two-headed-alligator-spotted-in-Florida/5141404226010/|title=Two-headed alligator spotted in Florida?|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story became an international headline, scientists started to question the authenticity of the creature. The story was later discovered to be a hoax.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/its-a-total-crock/2186639|title= That photo of a two-headed Seminole Heights alligator?

In 2016 a Seminole Heights community art fund, [[Urban Art Attack]], funded the building of a 6-foot two headed alligator statue in front of Southern Brewing and Winemaking at 4500 Nebraska Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urban legend''', '''urban myth''', '''urban tale''', or '''contemporary legend''' is a form of modern [[folklore]]. It usually consists of fictional stories, often presented as true, with [[macabre]] or [[humor]]ous elements, rooted in local [[popular culture]]. These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for random events such as disappearances and strange objects.

Urban legends are spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. More recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances, like the story of people ambushed and anesthetized, who awaken minus one kidney, which was supposedly [[Organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp |title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief |publisher=''[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]'' |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and structure ==
The term "urban legend," as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for "urban legend," citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, ''Our Living Traditions'', xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B. Edgerton, ''The Ghost in Search of Help for a Dying Man'', Journal of the Folklore Institute, Vol. 5, No. 1. pp. 31, 38, 41 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], professor of English at the [[University of Utah]], introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends &amp; Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

Many urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Epoch"/&gt; Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.&lt;ref name="Epoch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=''[[The Epoch Times]]'' |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagation and belief==
As Jan Brunvand points out,&lt;ref name="Death Car"&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/autos/cursed/deathcar.asp|title= snopes.com: Death Car|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2006-08-10|accessdate= 2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; antecedent legends including some of the motifs, themes and symbolism of these [[wikt:urtext|urtexts]] can readily be identified. Cases which ''may'' have been at least partially inspired by real events include "The Death Car" (traced by [[Richard Dorson]] to [[Michigan]], [[United States]]);&lt;ref name="Death Car"/&gt; "the Solid Cement Cadillac"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.snopes.com/love/revenge/concrete.asp|title= snopes.com: Cement in Lover's Car|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2006-08-10|accessdate= 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possible origin of "[[The Hook]]" in the 1946 series of [[lovers' lane | Lovers' Lane]] murders in [[Texarkana, Texas]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/hook.asp|title= snopes.com: The Hook|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2008-06-02|accessdate= 2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ramsland|first= Katherine|url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/texas_chainsaw_massa/5.html|title= Texas Chainsaw Massacre is based on a real case the crime library — Other Speculations — Crime Library on truTV.com|publisher= [[Turner Broadcasting System Inc.]]|accessdate= 2010-08-28|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831082654/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/texas_chainsaw_massa/5.html|archivedate= 2009-08-31|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban legend that [[Coca-Cola]] developed the drink [[Fanta]] to sell in [[Nazi Germany]] without public backlash originated as the actual tale of German [[Max Keith]], who invented the drink and ran Coca-Cola's operations in Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp|title= The Reich Stuff? |accessdate= 2007-01-09 |last= Mikkelson |first= Barbara|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teller of an urban legend may claim it happened to a friend (or to a [[friend of a friend]]), which serves to personalize, authenticate and enhance the power of the narrative&lt;ref name="believed"&gt;Brunvand, p.423&lt;/ref&gt; while distancing the teller. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes, contaminated foods, or other situations which would potentially affect many people. Anyone believing such stories might feel compelled to warn loved ones. On occasion, news organizations, school officials and even police departments have issued warnings concerning the latest threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Gross|first= Dave|url= http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/other/tattoo/|title= The "Blue Star" LSD Tattoo Urban Legend Page|publisher= ''the Lycaeum Drug Archives ''|accessdate= 2010-08-29|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718214538/http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/other/tattoo/|archivedate= 2011-07-18|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "Lights Out" rumor, [[street gang | street-gang]] members would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded with the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective new gang-member would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of [[initiation]].&lt;ref name="Snopes lights"&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/lightsout.asp|title= snopes.com: Flashing Headlights Gang Initiation|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2008-12-08|accessdate= 2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fax received at the [[Nassau County, Florida]] fire department was forwarded to police, and from there to all city departments. Even the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of Defence for Canada]] was taken in by the same legend; he forwarded an urgent security warning to all [[Ontario]] Members of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Snopes lights"/&gt;

Many urban legends are essentially extended [[joke]]s, told as if they were true events.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; Urban legends typically include common elements: the legend is retold on behalf of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often given for those who might not heed the advice or lesson contained therein (this forms a typical element of many e-mail [[phishing]] scams); and the tale is often touted as "something a friend told me", while the friend is identified by first name only or not identified at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6090918.stm | work= BBC News | title= Heard the one about... | date= 2006-10-27 | accessdate= 2010-03-28 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090604154846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6090918.stm | archivedate= 2009-06-04 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent urban legends often maintain a degree of plausibility, such as a [[serial killer]] deliberately hiding in the back seat of a car. One such example since the 1970s has been the recurring rumor that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Company was associated with [[Satan worship|Satan-worship]]pers because of details within its nineteenth-century trademark.&lt;ref&gt;''Procter and Gamble v. Amway'' 242 F.3d 539&lt;/ref&gt; The legend interrupted the company's business to the point that it stopped using the trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief and relation to mythology==
The earliest term by which these narratives were known, "urban belief tales", highlights what was then thought of{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} as a key property: their tellers regarded the stories as true accounts, and the device of the [[Friend of a friend | FOAF]] (acronym for "Friend Of A Friend" invented by English writer and folklorist [[Rodney Dale]] in 1976) was a spurious but significant effort at authentication.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; The coinage leads in turn to the terms "FOAFlore" and "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend, the "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dorson. "American Folklore" University of Chicago Press, 1959, pp. 250-52.&lt;/ref&gt; folklorists have an interest in debunking these narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the tales are told, re-told and believed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Adam Brooke Davis. "[http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm Davis, Adam Brooke. "Devil's Night and Hallowe'en: The Linked Fates of Two Folk Festivals." Missouri Folklore Society Journal XXIV(2002) 69-82] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305105514/http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm |date= 2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of [[myth]], these narratives are believed because they construct and reinforce the [[worldview]] of the group within which they are told, or "because they provide us with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events".&lt;ref&gt;John Mosier "WAR MYTHS" Historically Speaking: The Bulletin of the Historical Society: VI: 4, March/April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{when?|date=August 2018}} social scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to [[crime]], [[childcare]], [[fast food]], [[SUVs]] and other "family" choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Croft |first= Robin |year= 2006 |title= Folklore, Families and Fear: Exploring the Influence of the Oral Tradition on Consumer Decision-making |journal= Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 |issue= 9 &amp; 10 |pages= 1053–1076 |url= |doi= 10.1362/026725706778935574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular folklore, such as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', where similar themes and motifs arise. For this reason, it is characteristic of groups within which a given narrative circulates to react very negatively to claims or demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would be the expressions of outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration of Halloween treats by strangers (the subject of periodic [[moral panic]]s) occurs extremely rarely, if at all.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Documenting==
The Internet makes it easier to both spread urban legends and debunk them.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing, tracking, and analyzing urban legends is the topic of the [[Usenet]] newsgroup, ''alt.folklore.urban'' and several web sites, most notably [[snopes.com]]. The [[United States Department of Energy]] had a service, now discontinued, called Hoaxbusters, that dealt with computer-distributed [[hoax]]es and legends.

Television shows such as ''[[Urban Legends (TV series)|Urban Legends]]'', ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'', and later ''[[Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed]]'', feature re-enactments of urban legends detailing the accounts of the tales and (typically) later in the show, these programs reveal any factual basis they may have. The [[Discovery Channel]] TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' (2003–2016) tried to prove or disprove urban legends by attempting to reproduce them using the [[scientific method]].

The 1998 film ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' featured students discussing popular urban legends while at the same time falling victim to them.

Between 1992 and 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper "Weekend" section published the illustrated "Urban Myths" column by Phil Healey and Rick Glanvill, with content taken from a series of four books: ''Urban Myths'', ''The Return Of Urban Myths'', ''Urban Myths Unplugged'', and ''Now! That's What I Call Urban Myths''. The 1994 comics anthology the ''[[Big Book of Urban Legends]]'', written by Robert Boyd, [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], and [[Robert Loren Fleming]], collected two hundred urban legends told in comics form.

The British writer [[Tony Barrell (journalist)|Tony Barrell]] has explored urban legends in a long-running column in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. These include the story that [[Orson Welles]] began work on a [[Batman]] movie in the 1940s, which was to feature [[James Cagney]] as the [[Riddler]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] as [[Catwoman]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article176017.ece |title=Did You Know: Orson Welles |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142755/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article176017.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the persistent rumour that the rock singer [[Courtney Love]] is the granddaughter of [[Marlon Brando]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article184306.ece |title=Did You Know: Courtney Love |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142758/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article184306.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that in a famous 1970s poster of [[Farrah Fawcett]], there is a subliminal sexual message concealed in the actress' hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/tv/article186376.ece |title=Did You Know: Farrah Fawcett |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-10-04 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142752/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/tv/article186376.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Internet urban legends are [[folklore]] stories that are spread through the internet. They may be spread through [[Usenet]] or [[email]],&lt;ref name=frost&gt;Chris Frost, (2000) ..Tales on the Internet: making it up as you go along'', Aslib Proceedings, Vol. 52 Iss: 1, pp.5 - 10&lt;/ref&gt; or more recently by [[social media]].

===Types===
;Crime stories
:As with traditional urban legends, many Internet rumors are about crimes either fictional, or based on real events but blown out of proportion.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Donovan, No Way of Knowing: Crime, Urban Legends, and the Internet (Psychology Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Donovan, ''Crime legends in a new medium: Fact, fiction and loss of authority'', Theoretical Criminology; vol. 6 no. 2; May 2002; Pp. 189-215&lt;/ref&gt;
;Chain email letters
:[[Chain letter]]s are a variety of urban legends concerning e-mails that tell the reader to make copies of, and redistribute, the e-mail or they will meet a terrible fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Chain Linked| url=http://www.snopes.com/luck/chain.asp| work=Snopes.com| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fake virus and malware alerts
:[[Virus hoax|Fake virus alerts]], telling people of non-existent threats to their computer, are commonly distributed by email.&lt;ref name=frost/&gt;

===Use in marketing===
The capacity of the internet to spread rumors has been used in marketing, for instance with the low-budget film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', which was advertised as if it were about a genuine urban legend, rather than a work of original fiction.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Telotte, "The Blair Witch Project Project: Film and the Internet", Film Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 3; (Spring 2001), pp. 32-39&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vampire hunter''' or '''vampire slayer''' is a character in folklore and fiction who specializes in finding and destroying [[vampire]]s, and sometimes other supernatural creatures. A vampire hunter is usually described as having extensive knowledge of vampires and other monstrous creatures, including their powers and weaknesses, and uses this knowledge to effectively combat them. In most literature, vampire hunters are simply humans with more than average knowledge about the occult, while they may also be supernatural beings, having superhuman abilities in works of fiction. A well known and influential vampire hunter is Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]], a character in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 horror novel, ''[[Dracula]]''.

==In folklore==
"Professional" or semi-professional vampire hunters played some part in the vampire beliefs of the [[Balkans]] (especially in [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]], [[Serb]]ian, and [[Romani people|Romani]] folk beliefs). In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the terms used to designate them included ''glog'' (lit. "[[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]]", the species of wood used for the stake), ''vampirdzhiya'', ''vampirar'', ''dzhadazhiya'', ''svetocher''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

They were usually either born on [[Saturday]] (then called [[Week-day names#Weekdays numbered from Monday|Sabbatarian]]s,&lt;ref name=summers&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbott | first = George F. | date =1903 | title = Macedonian Folklore | pages = 221–222}}.

It was also believed that someone born on a Saturday could see a vampire when it was otherwise invisible&lt;ref name=summers/&gt;&lt;ref name=dimitr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McClelland, Bruce A.|title = Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|year=2006|pages=62–79|isbn=978-0-472-06923-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and sometimes other supernatural entities as well); similarly for the ''dhampir''. In the case of the Sabbatarians, it was believed in some places that they needed to be fed meat from a sheep killed by a wolf (Bulgarian ''vâlkoedene''); this would enable them not to fear the things that only they were able to see. In [[Croatia]]n and [[Slovenia]]n legends, the villages had their own vampire hunters that were called [[Krsnik (vampire hunter)|kresniks]], whose spirits were able to turn into animals at night to fight off the vampire or ''kudlak''.
  
Some carried a kit that used mallet, stake, crucifix.  If part of a church it included holy water, holy oil, etc.  However the most important things it carried were items such as rope, crowbars, or even pistols.&lt;ref name="dimitr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Маринов, Димитър. 1994 (first edition 1914) Народна вяра и религиозни обичаи.

==In fiction==
The vampire hunter has found new popularity in modern fiction and popular culture.

The most widely known example of a vampire hunter is [[Abraham Van Helsing]] of the novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and in other works of fiction adapting or modifying that work. Other more recent figures include [[Buffy Summers|Buffy "the Vampire Slayer" Summers]] from the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|television show]] and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|film]] of the same name. Buffy's spin-off series [[Angel (1999 TV series)|''Angel'']] is also focused on a vampire hunter, the titular star, Angel "the World's Champion," a vampire himself, is often portrayed battling vampires. Vampire hunters have also appeared in video games, such as ''[[Castlevania]]'' (occupation of the famed Belmont lineage), and ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' (with factions such as the Dawnguard).

As well as being knowledgeable about vampire lore, vampire hunters in fiction are often armed with an eclectic mix of items and weapons which are designed to take maximum advantage of the monster's traditional weaknesses. These have included [[firearm]]s with [[silver]] [[ammunition]], appropriate religious symbols, [[crossbow]]s that fire all wood bolts and even [[watergun]]s filled with blessed [[holy water]] in the movies ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' and ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]''.

The organizational strength of depicted vampire hunters can vary wildly. Most hunter characters are in small groups working alone and in secret. By contrast, the [[Hellsing Organization]] in the [[anime]] [[television series]], ''[[Hellsing]]'' is a British government paramilitary strike force with access to troops, heavy combat vehicles and weapons and even allied vampires.

While predominantly depicted as human, examples of other types of vampire hunters also exist. [[Dhampir]]ic figures, having a mix of human and vampire blood, are a popular form. [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] from the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gee|first=James Paul|year=2007|title=Pleasure, learning, video games, and life: The projective stance|journal=A new literacies sampler|volume=29|issn=1523-9543|citeseerx = 10.1.1.128.3508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[eponym]]ous hero of the ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'' series of comic books, [[Blade (film series)|movies]], [[Blade: The Series|television series]], and [[Blade Anime|anime]], are both examples of dhampir vampire-hunters. Even rarer are vampire hunters that are vampires themselves. Two examples of this type can be found in [[Morbius, the Living Vampire#Ultimate Marvel|Morbius from ''Ultimate Spider-Man'']], and Zero Kiryuu in the manga and anime series ''[[Vampire Knight]]''.

The image of the vampire hunter is often a mysterious and [[drama]]tic avenging hero, an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] [[extremist]], a [[mad scientist]], or sometimes a mix of these. A hunter may be a heroic figure, a villain (from the perspective of the vampire), a lonesome avenger, or sometimes, although not usually, a [[bounty hunter]]-style character, hunting vampires for profit. Vampire hunters have also popularly been depicted as hunting various creatures such as [[werewolves]], [[demons]], and other forms of [[undead]] as well. Others have been depicted as [[Mage (fantasy)|mages]] and [[cyborgs]]. Vampire hunters are often associated with and/or members of the clergy, holy orders, or other religious organizations which may be dedicated to fighting vampires, demons, and other supernatural forces. Vampire hunting as a family tradition or birthright is a popular use of the archetype in fiction, such as the [[List of Castlevania characters|Belmont family]] from the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series. Some hunters devote their entire lives to the eradication of vampires, for others it is just a strange hobby.

Of course with the job for human hunter, comes the risk of getting bitten and turned into vampires themselves. More often than not fellow hunters, usually do mercy killing to prevent them from becoming monsters, though in some fiction it may be possible for a hunter to purify and/or cure themselves (and/or others) of vampirism, especially if the person in question was recently turned into a vampire. Another common trope is hunters being forced to slay their loved ones and/or allies who have been turned into vampires. Alternatively, after becoming a vampire, sometimes hunters will continue to fight and hunt vampires using their newly acquired vampire powers/abilities (sometimes being hunted by their former allies and other human vampire hunters). In addition to human hunters, dhampirs, and vampires that hunt other vampires, it is not uncommon for vampire hunters to be other supernatural creatures such as werewolves or witches. Additionally, some human hunters may possess divine/holy powers, superhuman, and/or other supernatural abilities that they can use both to fight and protect themselves from vampires and other supernatural entities they hunt. Some hunters may even resort to using dark powers/weapons (usually dark magic and/or demonic in nature). Some human hunters may even be tempted to become vampires themselves in order to obtain their powers and immortality, either to continue hunting them, due to fear of their own mortality, and/or simply a lust for power.

'''''Vestoj''''' (meaning "clothing" in [[Esperanto]]) is an annual [[academic journal]] about [[dress]] and [[fashion]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher is Anja Aronowsky Cronberg.

==History==
''Vestoj – the Journal of Sartorial Matters'' was established by [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher Anja Aronowsky Cronberg in 2009. It sets out to "combine theoretical knowledge about fashion with experience from the fashion industry. In the first issue a manifesto was formulated that more than anything was about bridging the gap between fashion as an academic subject of study and fashion as a business".&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Karin, Det Svenska Modeundret, Norstedts, Stockholm, 2011, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; It "stands apart from the current crop of new magazines because of its consciously intellectual stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/3799/ |title=Here is the secret, here is the trick |author=O'Neill, Alistair |work=UAL Research Online |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' combines scholarly texts about fashion with [[fiction]], [[nonfiction]], [[poetry]], and [[visual arts|visuals]]. Each issue is thematic and its subject matter is reflected in both editorial content and art direction. Every issue consequently has a different logo, style, format, and graphic design. In contrast to the majority of [[list of fashion magazines|fashion magazines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Alison Matthews|title=''Vogue's'' New World: American Fashionability and the Politics of Style|journal=Fashion Theory|date=21 April 2015|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=13–38|doi=10.2752/136270406778051049}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' contains no advertising and does not revolve around the fashion seasonal calendar.

==Reception==
''Vestoj'' has been called "one of the most successful attempts to provide the young academic discipline fashion studies with an equivalent to, say, the medical journal ''The Lancet''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidbloggen.se/2009/11/24/vestoj-allvarligt-talat-om-mode-pa-esperanto/ |title=Vestoj: Allvarligt talat.

In an interview on AnOthermag.com, Aronowsky Cronberg explains her approach, stating that ''Vestoj'' aims to have "an intelligent and multi-facetted approach to sartorial matters. What I find the most interesting methodology is the one that deals with both the production and consumption of a garment, as well as with the analysis of it. […] Through the study of fashion you can understand any given point in history, our desires, ideals, wants and needs. The aspect of fashion that deals with voracious consumption has spread into every way we relate to [[culture]]; today we consume ideas, knowledge and people as much as we consume goods. Fashion in that sense is nothing short of a Gesamtkunstwerk." &lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54033">This '''list of the works of [[William Crooke]]''' (1848–1923) represents much of his literary output in pursuit of his interests in [[ethnology]] and [[folklore]], for which he was far many years considered to be a leading authority.

In addition to the items listed below in respect of ''Folk-lore Record'' and its successor, ''Folk-lore'', the journal of the [[Folklore Society]], Crooke also contributed frequently to that journal in the form of letters and brief observations. He was editor of the journal from 1915 until his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

In addition to these works, Crooke made many contributions to the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''.

He had been editing the ''Katha Sagara Kosa'', as translated by [[Charles Henry Tawney]], at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====
{{Main article|White witch}}

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon.

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011.

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

==== Colonial North America ====
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of witchcraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/city/jamestown-tn/TPAPB6U4LVF0JDQC8/p2|title=Old Stories|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=History of Fentress County, Tennessee|last1=Hogue|first1=Albert Ross|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touring the East Tennessee Backroads |first=Carolyn |last=Sakowski|page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=9780895874764 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crucible]]'' by Arthur Miller is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the [[Salem witch trials]] that took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during 1692–93.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H.

Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016: "What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I’m sorry if that seems "unfair," but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North America (Mexico) ====
{{See also|Brujería}}
Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

==== Nepal ====
Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent. According to the statistics in 2013, there was a total of 69 reported cases of abuse to women due to accusation of performing witchcraft. The perpetrators of this malpractice are usually neighbors, so-called [[witch doctor]]s and family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title= Violence against Women/Girls Assessing the Situation of Nepal in 2013|url=http://inseconline.org/pics/1394188608.pdf |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=56 |doi= |access-date= 2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes of these malpractices are lack of education, lack of awareness and superstition.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

=== Europe ===
{{Main article|European witchcraft|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]
In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will. It also included other gifts, such as [[second sight]] to a certain extent, the power to bring [[luck|good or evil luck]], and the ability already mentioned to deal death at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beatrice Grimshaw|author-link=Beatrice Grimshaw|date=1908|title=In the Strange South Seas|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/instrangesouths00grimgoog#page/n112/mode/2up|chapter=A Mystic Power|publisher=London: Hutchinson &amp; Co.|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Women's cinema''' is a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film.  This can include women filling behind the scene roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays.

Renowned female directors include [[Kathryn Bigelow]], who is the only woman to receive an academy award for best director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director|title=Kathryn Bigelow makes history as first woman to win best director Oscar|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=2010-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with many other women directors from around the world such as [[Mary Harron]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Sofia Coppola]], and [[Catherine Hardwicke]].  Many successful cinematographers are also women, including [[Maryse Alberti]], [[Reed Morano]] and Zoe White. 

Women's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well.  Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=9781903364277|location=|pages=1–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction", Alison Butler explains.  The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of be associated with marginalization and ideological controversy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Famous women in film history==

===Silent films===
[[Alice Guy-Blaché]] was a film pioneer and likely the first female director. Working for the [[Gaumont Film Company]] in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created ''[[La Fée aux Choux]]'' (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but ''La Fée aux Choux'' may well be the first narrative film ever released.&lt;ref name="Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of [[silent film]]s in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/alice-guy-blache/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American-born director, [[Lois Weber]] was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/lois-weber/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber is well known for her films [[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|''Hypocrites'']] (1915), ''[[The Blot]]'' (1921), and ''[[Suspense (1913 film)|Suspense]]'' (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film ''[[Where Are My Children?]] (1916)'' addresses the controversial issues of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]]. And she questioned the validity of [[capital punishment]] in ''[[The People vs. John Doe]]'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lois_Weber.aspx|title=Lois Weber Facts, information, pictures |website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mabel Normand]] was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts [[Charlie Chaplin]] did as [[The Tramp]] at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/212-Chaplin-at-Keystone-The-Tramp-is-Born|title=Charlie Chaplin : Chaplin at Keystone: The Tramp is Born|website=www.charliechaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harper Fussell| first = Betty| authorlink = Betty Fussell| publisher = Limelight Editions| edition=   Illustrated| year= 1992| title = Mabel: Hollywood's First I-Don't-Care Girl| isbn = 978-0-87910-158-9| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pd4nAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780879101589| accessdate = July 29, 2010| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema. [[Frances Marion]], [[Anita Loos]], and [[June Mathis]] all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in [[Hollywood]].

In Sweden, [[Anna Hofman-Uddgren]] was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film ''[[Stockholmsfrestelser]]'' in 1911. She also acted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marika V. Lagercrantz |chapter-url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-20370 |chapter=En oavslutad berättelse. Om varietéstjärnan Anna Hofmann |year=2009 |title=Kulturellt: Reflektioner i Erling Bjurströms anda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Hollywood===
As the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the [[Hays Code]] in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo. [[Dorothy Arzner]] was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite av media|title=The Women Who Run Hollywood|author=Clara Kuperberg, Julia Kuperberg|year=2016|work= Wichita Films|format=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics find her film, ''[[Dance, Girl, Dance]]'', about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]], it was noted that "The dancers, played by [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Lucille Ball]], strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead [[Louis Hayward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2007.html Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007], from the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond ''Dance, Girl, Dance'', Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' (1933) and [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937).

===Experimental and avant-garde cinema===
The experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=1903364272|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pam Cook]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share "a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Palgrave|year=1989|isbn=9780333445297|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre. [[Germaine Dulac]] was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41086659|title=The St. James women filmmakers encyclopedia : women on the other side of the camera|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|others=Unterburger, Amy L.|year=|isbn=9781578590926|location=Detroit|pages=122–124|oclc=41086659}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Maya Deren]]'s visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45888927|title=Maya Deren and the American avant-garde|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|others=Nichols, Bill, 1942-|isbn=0520224442|location=Berkeley|oclc=45888927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Shirley Clarke]] was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=After the New American Cinema: Shirley Clarke's Video Work as Performance and Document|url=|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|publication-date=Spring–Summer 2012|volume=64|pages=57–64|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries. [[Joyce Wieland]] was a Canadian [[experimental film]] maker. The [[National Film Board of Canada]] allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like [[Valie Export]] were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of [[video]]s.

== Impact on society ==

===Impact of second-wave feminism===
In the late sixties, when the second wave of [[feminism]] started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like [[Newsreel]], but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. A first masterpiece was ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'' by [[Barbara Loden]], one of the most poignant portraits of alienation ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENELOW|first=SHONNI|date=September–October 2017|title=STRONGER TOGETHER|url=|journal=Film Comment|volume=53|pages=50–55|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of "sisterhoods" in movies, a good example of which is ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism, Femininity and Popular Culture|last=Hollows|first=Joanne|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|isbn=0719043956|location=Manchester, U.K. ; New York, N.Y.|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema Book 3rd rev. edition|last=Cook|first=Pam (ed.)|last2=Anneke M.|first2=Smelik|publisher=London: British Film Institute|year=2007|isbn=9781844571925|location=London, U.K.|pages=492|chapter=Feminist Film Theory|chapter-url=https://repository.ubn.ru.nl//bitstream/handle/2066/44160/44160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as [[Sally Potter]]'s ''Thriller'' in 1979.

===Representing sexuality===
Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of [[second-wave feminism]]. [[Abortion]] was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality ([[lesbianism]], [[sado-masochism]]) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.
[[Birgit Hein]], [[Elfi Mikesch]], [[Nelly Kaplan]], [[Catherine Breillat]] and [[Barbara Hammer]] are some of the directors to be remembered.

A film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is Lizzie Borden's ''[[Working Girls (1986 film)|Working Girls]]'' (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her "johns" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Glynis, Alexandra Devon, and Catehrina Tammaro. [http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/video/review/lizzie_borden.html "Anarcha-Filmmaker: An Interview with Lizzie Borden."] ''[[Kick It Over]]'' 18 (Spring 1987). Web. 30 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who can't obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The [[Bechdel test]] for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The 3 factors tested are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma &amp; Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'' or ''[[I Don't Know How She Does It]]''. Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and Furiosa in ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''. These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs  compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jocelyn Nicole, "The role of women in film: Supporting the men -- An analysis of how culture influences the changing discourse on gender representations in film" (2015). ''Journalism Undergraduate Honors Theses.'' Paper 2. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=jouruht&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fear of entering cinematography ===
Many women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handy|first=Jocelyn|last2=Rowlands|first2=Lorraine|date=2016-07-21|title=The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and defensive organizational practices within the New Zealand film industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726716651690|journal=Human Relations|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=312–338|doi=10.1177/0018726716651690|issn=0018-7267}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wing-Fai|first=Leung|last2=Gill|first2=Rosalind|last3=Randle|first3=Keith|date=May 2015|title=Getting in, Getting on, Getting out? Women as Career Scramblers in the UK film and Television Industries|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12240|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=50–65|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12240|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wing-Fai, 2015). These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.

However, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there is not many women in senior positions in the industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Compared to the amount of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. “However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.

The way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women’s pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Deborah|last2=Pringle|first2=Judith K.|date=May 2015|title=Unmanageable Inequalities: Sexism in the Film Industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12239|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=37–49|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12239|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.

===Resisting violence and violent resistance===
Resisting patriarchal violence was a key concern of second-wave feminism during the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Pilar Rodriguez|date=November 2011|title=Feminism and Violence: The Hegemonic Second Wave’s Encounter with Rape and Domestic Abuse in USA (1970-1985)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0921374011430566|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=147–172|doi=10.1177/0921374011430566|issn=0921-3740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many feminists of the second wave have taken part in the peace movements of the eighties, as had their foremothers in the older pacifist movements. The effects that war conflict had on women following the cold war was often overlooked. Post cold-war conflicts resulted in women being subjected to increased forms of torture, rape, and violence.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Citation|last=El-Bushra|first=Judy|title=Feminism, Gender, and Women's Peace Activism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444306675.ch7|work=Gender Myths and Feminist Fables|pages=127–143|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|isbn=9781444306675|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in women’s peace organizations and initiatives to protest violence against women, resulting in more criticism of the patriarchal cliché of the 'peaceable' woman.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Women film directors documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist resistance movements. Inspired by the Hindu goddess Mother Kali--who is traditionally associated with sexuality, violence, and motherly-tenderness-- German filmmakers Birgit and Wilhelm Hein created their Kali Film, which depicts women as violent and threatening, the opposite of the innocent “caretaker” stereotype generally assigned to women characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bampfa.org/event/kali-film|title=Kali Film {{!}} BAMPFA|website=bampfa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers assembled found footage from 'trivial' genres, the only domain of cinema in which the portrayal of aggressive women was allowed. 

Filmmakers have also begun to take on representations of sexuality and gender in films directed specifically at college students. As campus sexual assault continues to pervade universities, filmmakers have started to create films that address these issues. In 2014 a group of students and faculty at Texas Tech University created the film series “Sexism | Cinema,” to provide education on violence against women and sexual abuse on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=John B.

=== Statistics ===
A study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters.  USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.

For the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian.  Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse.  Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dr. Stacy|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|year=2016|title=Inequality in 800 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, LGBT, and Disability from 2007-2015|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Dr%20Stacy%20L%20Smith%20Inequality%20in%20800%20Films%20FINAL.ashx|journal=USC Annenburg|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the scenes had similar statistics to the female fictional characters.  Female directors, writers, and producers made up 19% of the 1,365 people that it took to create the top 100 films in 2015.  The percentage of female writers (11.8%) and producers (22%) can be seen as high compared to female directors (7.5%).  Of the 7.5% of female directors, three of them were African American and one was Asian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For the top 100 films every year from 2007 until 2015, of the 800 films, 4.1% were directed by females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
While there is still a gap between the percent of female and male filmmakers, women tend to be more involved in documentary films.  There is a higher percentage of women directing documentaries than women directing narrative films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauren|first=Martha|year=2013|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind the Scenes Employment of Women on Top 250 Films of 2015|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2012_Celluloid_Ceiling_Exec_Summ.pdf|journal=Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celluloid ceiling ===
The Center of the Study of Women in Television and Film has dedicated 18 years to the study of women in the film industry.  An annual report is created, discussing how women have contributed to as filmmakers.  Most of the findings from the research shows that, statistically, it says the same from year to year.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|title=Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest earning movies of the past 20 years, with the exception of foreign films and reissues, have been monitored and studied by the Celluloid Ceiling to provide information on the contributions and employment of women on these films.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/|title=Research – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, as of 2017, “women comprised 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films."&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;The same study concluded that in 2017, 10 or more women were given one of these positions in 1% of films, compared to 10 or more men being hired for these jobs in 70% of films.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;Information from the Celluloid Ceiling shows that more women tend to be employed on film projects directed by women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;According to the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, "in films with at least one female director, women comprised 53% of writers. Conversely, in films with male directors, women comprised just 10% of writers."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/972309987|title=Celluloid and Silicon Ceilings: Underinvestment in Women Directors and Entrepreneurs|last=Rose|first=McKinley,|date=2016-12-01|publisher=Duke University School of Law|oclc=972309987}}&lt;/ref&gt;Statistically, female directors generally create films about and for women, and hire women to assume the roles of main characters or protagonists.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy additionally found that "in 2015, women comprised only 22% of protagonists and 18% of antagonists. Just 34% of major characters and 33% of all speaking characters in the top 100 domestic grossing films were women.”

&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The group also contributes their time to creating articles discussing how women are viewed in film, not only as filmmakers but as fictional characters as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==African American women's cinema==
[[Julie Dash]]'s ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'' (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an [[African American]] woman. Since then there have been several African or African-American women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. [[Neema Barnette]] (''[[Civil Brand]]''), [[Maya Angelou]] (''[[Down in the Delta]]''), [[Kasi Lemmons]] (''[[Eve's Bayou]]''), [[Cheryl Dunye]] (''[[My Baby's Daddy]]''), [[Stephanie Allain]] (''[[Biker Boyz]]''), [[Tracey Edmonds]] (''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]''), [[Frances-Anne Solomon]] (''[[A Winter Tale]]'') and [[Dianne Houston]] (''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]''), [[Leslie Harris (director)|Leslie Harris]] ([[Just Another Girl on the IRT]]) are among these filmmakers. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-23/entertainment/9410230140_1_story-of-lisette-linares-film-transvestite-brother|title=She Likes It Like That|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, [[Nnegest Likké]] is the first [[African American]] woman to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio, ''[[Phat Girlz]]'' (2006) starring [[Jimmy Jean-Louis]] and [[Mo'Nique]].

The Cameroonian journalist [[Thérèse Sita-Bella]] directed a 1963 documentary, ''[[Tam-Tam à Paris]]'', and [[Sarah Maldoror]], a French filmmaker of Guadeloupean descent, shot the feature-film ''[[Sambizanga (film)|Sambizanga]]'' in Angola in 1972. But the first African woman film director to gain international recognition was the [[Senegal]]ese [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Safi Faye]] with a film about the village in which she was born (''[[Kaddu Beykat|Letter from the Village]]'', 1975). The 1989 [[Créteil International Women's Film Festival]] included short films by [[Leonie Yangba Zowe]] of the [[Central African Republic]] (''Yangba-Bola'' and ''Lengue'', 1985) and [[Flora M'mbugu-Schelling]] of [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn1990Africa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Martin|editor=Annette Kuhn|title=The Women's Companion to International Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjqOM04aGJ8C&amp;pg=PA4|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08879-5|pages=4–8|chapter=Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other African women filmmakers include [[Anne Mungai]], [[Fanta Régina Nacro]] (''[[The Night of Truth]]'', 2004), Tsitsi Dangarembga (''Mother's Day'', 2004) and [[Marguerite Abouet]], an Ivorian graphic novel writer who co-directed an animated film based on her graphic novel: [[Aya de Yopougon (film)|Aya de Yopougon]] (2012).

=== India ===

A number of well-known Indian female filmmakers have achieved astounding commercial success from their films, including [[Mira Nair]], [[Aparna Sen]], [[Deepa Mehta]], [[Gurinder Chadha]], and [[Manju Borah]]. However, there are a number of other Indian women filmmakers who have made some remarkable films that go beyond just entertainment; they take advantage of their platform to address a range of social and political issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2fa22a3a-5cf4-4b61-ab24-de6a55a01f2d@sdc-v-sessmgr04|title=FEMINIST FILMMAKING AND THE FUTURE OF GLOBAL FILM POLITICS: WOMEN'S CINEMA,...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy Indian women filmmakers include [[Nisha Ganatra]], [[Sonali Gulati]], [[Indu Krishnan]], [[Eisha Marjara]], [[Pratibha Parmar|Pratibha PJaaparmar]], [[Nandini Sikand]], [[Ish Amitoj Kaur]], [[Harpreet Kaur]], [[Leena Manimekalai]] and [[Shashwati Talukdar]], [[Rima Das]].

[[Deepa Mehta]] is known as a transnational filmmaker whose work in film is recognized internationally at the highest levels. Her emotionally moving, award winning films have been played at almost every major film festival across the globe, and rank as favorites amongst many.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonmehta.com/about-1/|title=About — Hamilton-Mehta Productions|website=Hamilton-Mehta Productions|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She produced the film [[Heaven on Earth (2008 film)|''Heaven on Earth'']], in 2008, which premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

[[Mira Nair]], a talented and accomplished Indian filmmaker, has written, produced and directed a plethora of award-winning documentaries. Her unique ability to provoke both western and non-western viewers in a variety of ways has led her to be seen as a non-traditional filmmaker who is not afraid of creating controversy through her work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Alpana|date=January 2001|title=Body matters: The politics of provocation in Mira Nair's films|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10509200109361515|journal=Quarterly Review of Film and Video|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=91–103|doi=10.1080/10509200109361515|issn=1050-9208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''So Far From India'' (1983) depicted the story of a young, working Indian immigrant in New York City and his harrowing experience of acculturation.

=== Japan ===

In Japan for a long time [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] was the only woman to make feature films. She was able to do this against fierce resistance because she enjoyed a status as star actress. Using genre conventions, she showed women "with a humorous affection rare in Japanese cinema of the period" (Philip Kemp).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Currently, the best-known women filmmaker of Japan may be [[Naomi Kawase]]; 2007 she won the Grand Prix in [[Cannes]], while [[Memoirs of a fig tree]], the directorial debut of well-known actress [[Kaori Momoi]], saw the light of the day in 2006. The sociocritical adventure film ''[[K-20: Legend of the Mask]]'' by Shimako Sato's was ''[[K-20: Legend of the Mask|S]]''a breakthrough into a bigger budget; it starred [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] and was released all over the world.

=== South Korea ===
