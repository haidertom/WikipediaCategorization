'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

===Place names===

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

==Localization in African languages==

The term Africanization, abbreviated as the [[numeronym]] "A12n," has been applied to discussion of [[internationalization and localization]] of software and content in [[African languages]].

'''Amira Abase''', '''Shamima Begum''' and '''Kadiza Sultana''' are three British schoolgirls from the [[Bethnal Green Academy]] in London who left home in February 2015 to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). According to the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries have travelled to join the Islamic State as of 2015&lt;ref name="TMDUPGIP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltman|first1=Erin Marie |last2=Smith |first2=Melanie |title='Till Martyrdom Do Us Part' Gender and the ISIS Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=Institute for Strategic Dialogue |page=4|url=http://www.strategicdialogue.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Till_Martyrdom_Do_Us_Part_Gender_and_the_ISIS_Phenomenon.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—part of what some&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hegghammer, an expert on Islamist militancy affiliated with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (source: {{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}})&lt;/ref&gt; have called "a jihadi, girl-power subculture".&lt;ref name="isowbw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The three girls had been questioned by the police in December 2014 after another girl from their school travelled to Syria, but were found not to be at risk.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; They flew via [[Turkish Airlines]] from [[Gatwick Airport]], London, to [[Istanbul]] on 17 February.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria girls: Families 'cannot stop crying'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31575908|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their families went to Turkey in March to probe the disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isil defector girls' families go to Turkey to probe disappearance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11491142/Isil-defector-girls-families-go-to-Turkey-to-probe-disappearance.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a [[Glasgow]] woman who joined ISIL in 2013. There have been electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; She faces criminal charges if she returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scots jihadi will be prosecuted if she comes home, say police|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/313329-scots-jihadi-aqsa-mahmood-will-be-prosecuted-if-she-comes-home-say-police/|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=STV|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmood denies the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=James|title=Glasgow 'jihadist' Aqsa Mahmood denies recruiting London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-31908202|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, on a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher [[Anjem Choudary]] against the film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]''. The [[Metropolitan Police]] examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Ben|title=Jihadi schoolgirl's father marched at flag-burning rally|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/jihadi-schoolgirls-father-marched-at-flagburning-rally-anjem-choudary-10138591.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussen said in April that he feels ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of schoolgirl feared to have joined Islamic State denies 'extremism' claim|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-04-07/father-of-schoolgirl-feared-to-have-joined-islamic-state-denies-extremism-claim/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=ITV News|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flight. They will not face criminal charges if they return to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=David|title=Three 'Jihadi brides' from London who travelled to Syria will not face terrorism charges if they return|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11461693/Sisters-of-the-missing-jihadi-brides-to-face-radicalisation-tests.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on its circumstances in March 2015.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The families of the girls received an apology from [[Scotland Yard]], who did not tell them about the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Police sorry for failure to warn families of Isis girls about schoolfriend's flight|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11415790|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has said that police should not be made "scapegoats" for people joining ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaders: Vigilance crucial or more will be lost to IS|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/leaders-vigilance-crucial-or-more-will-be-lost-to-is-1-3715147|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Scotsman|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said "Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beake|first1=Nick|title=David Cameron concerned over Syria-bound London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32134575|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a travel ban was imposed upon five girls from the Bethnal Green Academy due to concerns from social services that they the girls attend the same school as the three who had already joined the group, stating that it was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Travel ban for five east London girls over fears they will join Isis in Syria|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/27/five-girls-barred-from-travel-same-school-three-teenagers-syria-bethnal-green-academy|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teenagers have not made contact with their families since May 2016. Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant. Sultana is said to have married a western ISIS fighter with Somali heritage, but wanted to return to the UK after he was killed in battle.

[[File:Roussillon - Carte de Nicolas de Fer (1706).jpg|thumb|Map of the province of Roussillon by Nicolas de Fer (1706)]]
  
The '''Angelets''', or “the Angelets of the Earth” (in Catalan, ''“els Angelets de la Terra”''), were peasants who rose up from 1667 to 1675 against the French authorities of the [[Roussillon]] province. The group of conflicts of the period is subsumed under the name of “the '''Revolt of the Angelets'''”. The cause was the instituting of the [[gabelle]] (salt tax) in 1661 — a measure contrary to traditional constitutions of the earldom (the earldom of Roussillon and [[Cerdanya]], the lands of the crown of [[Majorca]] from 1276 to 1344).

The revolt first concerned the county of [[Vallespir]], then it won those of [[Conflent]] and Roussillon.

== The name ==

[[File:Guido Reni 031.jpg|thumb|The archangel of Saint Michael]]
The reason why the revolts are referred to as “angelets” is unknown. One of the explanations advanced is the popular belief according to which the angels know the mountains well; another is the faculty that they have of appearing and disappearing.

As for the word ''“miquelets,”'' it refers primarily to Catalan mercenaries but sometimes to armed peasants. There is thus confusion among the ancient authors, particularly in relation to the war of Holland: They designate under the name “''miquelets''” all those who, in the province of Roussillon, oppose the king of France — though it be angelets or Catalan mercenaries in the service of the king of Spain.

[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] is the patron saint of the miquelets and the wool-workers of [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste|Prats-de-Mollo]], he who gave a sacred tint to one revolt that reclaimed liberties with the patriotic cry of ''“Visca la terra!”'' (“Long live the Land!”)

== Context ==

On May 8, 1659, the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] came to an end, and on November 7, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] was signed between the Spanish and the French monarchies. The agreement notably foresaw a sharing of the principality of Catalonia between the two sovereigns. The crown of France annexed five [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (corresponding to the two [[Counts]], minus lower Cerdanya and [[Llívia]]):

* the comarque of Roussillon
* Vallespir
* Conflent

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] engaged himself with respecting the local customs.  But, since June 1660, he replaced Catalan institutions and agencies with his own political, judiciary, and fiscal structures.  He created a sovereign Council at [[Perpignan]]. Then he named a steward.

Resistance to the new master began in March 1661. Having come to settle a disagreement between the inhabitants of [[Ayguatébia-Talau|Ayguatébia]] and those of [[Oreilla]], the viguier (magistrate) Marsal was violently attacked.  He succeeded in escaping, but the notary and the domestic who accompanied him were killed.  Immediately, the comarque of Conflent was subjected to a tax intended to pay the sometent français (the militia).

=== The Gabelle ===

The [[gabelle]], a tax on salt, had been abolished by the Catalan courts since the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], in 1283. In 1661, the French reestablished it. Its revenue was intended to finance the maintenance and construction of fortresses, as well as the payment of French functionaries. The measure was very unpopular. The king of France’s misuse of this tax’s revenue — to the detriment of Perpignan, which was only cashing an insignificant part of it — was considered an abjuration of the royal oath to respect the capital privileges of the comarque of Roussillon. The consuls of Perpignan protested. But the sovereign Council’s decision rejected the municipal complaint and imposed the will of the Louvre.

In Vallespir, a country of pastures, salt was necessary for feeding livestock and preserving meat. The inhabitants sent for it from the other side of the wholly new border. The tax made its price rise inordinately. In 1667, the peasants of Vallespir refused to pay it.

== The First Revolt (1667–68) ==

Smuggling was organized. The inspectors tracked down the traffickers in order to try to put an end to this activity. The peasants reacted, transforming themselves into veritable guerrilla fighters, harassing the French soldiers and especially the functionaries of the salt tax. An armed resistance was organized under the leadership of Joseph of Trinxeria, a merchant of Prats-de-Mollo.

The insurgents spread themselves in the county of Vallespir. In 1667, they hid in the villages of [[Serralongue]] and [[Montferrer]]. The following year, they attacked the hotel of [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda|Amélie-les-Bains]], where the tax collectors are housed. They besieged the deputy provost Maniel in the church of [[Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans]]. The repression did not rest: eight inhabitants were condemned to death and 51 put into slavery. This did nothing to discourage the smugglers.

The president of the sovereign Council, the collaborator Francesc de Segarra, offered a reward of 100 gold ''doubles tournois'' (coins) to whoever would give information against the leaders of the resistance. On September 14, 1668, he left with 300 soldiers to make base at [[Arles]] in order to begin a harsh suppression. The punitive expedition was routed at Llop pass and had to retreat to Arles.

For several years, the rebels, knowing the terrain well, inflicted substantial losses on the French troops.   From August 3, 1667 to June 30, 1668, they also pursued and eliminated a good number of salt tax inspectors.

The authorities of the salt tax resolved to negotiate: The armed struggle ceased and, in exchange, the townships of Vallespir could obtain smuggled salt. Through the “Compromise of [[Céret]],” the salt tax inspectors began to put an end to the controls and to coordinate with the council of each village, as to who would be charged from then on with the distribution of salt to the inhabitants.

== The Second Revolt (1670–74) ==

[[File:1674 - Plan bataille Maureillas.jpg|thumb|Battle plan near Maureillas in 1674]]
In 1669, in Conflent, Joan Miquel Mestre, called “the Righteous Heir,” demanded a similar arrangement for [[Baillestavy]]. From September to November, he kept track of the customs officers. It was at that moment that the revolts were referred to under the name of “angelets.”  Mestre was stopped by chance on the road from [[Camprodon]] on January 22, 1670 by the governor of Prats-de-Mollo. This set off a revolt on the part of the inhabitants, led by Josep de la Trinxeria and his lieutenant Damià Nohell, son of the mayor of Serralongue. They took the governor’s wife and children hostage and negotiated their release in return for that of the Righteous Heir. The exchange completed, the angelets returned via [[Tech (river)|the Tech]], seeing their troops grow to 1,500 men.

At this moment the revolt not only began again but also intensified considerably. The fighting stretched to all of Vallespir: On February 27, 1670, the insurgents seized Arles, from which they chased the garrison and killed the mayor. From March 31 to April 2, they besieged Céret, the capital of Vallespir.

The angelets held the high valley of Tech as well as Conflent. This was when the French sent an army of 4,000 soldiers. Avoiding offering an easy target on the route from the valley, they progressed through the mountains of Haut-Conflent that separated the two comarques, in order to take Vallespir from the rear. The technique of guerrilla warfare did not allow for maintaining a lined-up battle, on open terrain, facing a complete army: On May 5, the angelets were defeated at the Queen’s Pass, at the food of the Guillem Flat.   Some took refuge in the principality of Catalonia; others hid in the mountains.   The last bastion of the angelets having been defeated, the village of Py was sentenced to be razed.   Salt had to be scattered over its ruins.

=== Beginnings of the War of Holland ===

Hostilities were revived by the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78), of which the Spanish front became one of the theaters. The struggle of the population then took the character of an anti-French uprising. The angelets collaborated with the Spanish monarchy (1673).

The village and church of Ayguatébia were burned by French troops on February 7, 1673.

The year 1674 was particularly difficult for the French, in the province of Roussillon. They would face conspiracies (Villefranche and Perpignan) and an entry of Spanish troops.

=== The Villefranche Conspiracy ===

The angelets were involved in the Villefranche Conspiracy, which aimed to reunite the Counties at the principality of Catalonia, on “Holy Saturday” in 1674.

The conspiracy was discovered. Its leader, Manuel Descatllar, was arrested. He was transferred to Perpignan where, under terrible torture, he confessed all his activities. He was executed in the square of [[La Loge, Pas-de-Calais|La Loge]] on April 20, 1674. As for his companion Francesc Puig i Terrats, he was condemned to death and had his throat cut in public, in front of his own house, on May 16. His body was quartered. The four parts of him were exhibited at four points in the city. Many other conspirators paid for their involvement through the loss of their civic and patrimonial rights.

=== Repression and End of the Revolt ===

The population was always in question. The king of Spain’s troops crossed the frontier and took the fort of Bellegarde (beginning 1674). They controlled a great part of the province (Cerdagne and Vallespir, a part of Roussillon and of Conflent) after they won the [[Battle of Maureillas]] over the French army on July. It was only in 1675 that the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Count of Schomberg]], taking advantage of the Spanish withdrawal of troops to face the recent [[Revolt of Messina]], took back Bellegarde and routed them once and for all.

The region was now overrun with the French troops. The repression reached the whole population: imprisonment, sentencing to the galleys, executions, confiscation of goods, and heavy fines imposed on the communes (that of Prats-de-Mollo was of 3,500 pounds, that of Saint-Laurent was of 1,600 pounds).

The revolt of the angelets was considered finished in 1675.

The hatreds were so exacerbated, and the cost of suppression was so high, that Louis XIV tried to exchange the Counties in return for Flanders. But [[Charles II of Spain]] refused.

The revolt being completely put out, the king of France renounced this exchange during negotiations of the [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], which put an end, in 1678, to the Franco-Dutch War.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7001">[[Image:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|200px|upright|Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets'' (1779–81) was possibly the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">'''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena''' ({{lang-el|Κλεοπάτρα Τρύφαινα}}) was an Egyptian Ptolemaic queen. She may be identical with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V]].

There were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena'':

==Tryphaena, daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III==
[[Tryphaena]] was a sister of [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], [[Ptolemy X Alexander I]], [[Cleopatra IV of Egypt|Cleopatra IV]] and [[Cleopatra Selene of Syria|Cleopatra Selene]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|title=Numismatic Evidence for a New Seleucid King: Seleucus (VII) Philometor|author=Brian Kritt|journal=The Celator|volume=16|issue=4|date=April 2002|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103357/http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this ''Tryphaena'' also bore the name ''Cleopatra'', has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]], king of [[Seleucid Empire|Syria]], in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: [[Seleucus VI Epiphanes]], the twin [[Antiochus XI Epiphanes]] and [[Philip I Philadelphus]], [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]], and [[Antiochus XII Dionysus]]. The couple also had a daughter called [[Laodice VII Thea|Laodice]].  Tryphaena was killed in [[Antioch]] (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]], as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Justin | title = Epitoma historiarum Philippicarum Pompei Trogi | pages = 39.2.3, 39.3.4–12 | authorlink = Justin (historian)}}, our only source for these events.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes==
[[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V Tryphaena]] was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena''.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;

==Cleopatra Tryphaena, daughter of Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII Auletes==
She is called ''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena'' by some modern historians&lt;ref name = "Tyldesley" /&gt; and she would have been an older sister of the famous [[Cleopatra VII]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] took control of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], cited by [[Felix Jacoby]], ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'', no. 260 F 2, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] | title = ''Chronicle'' | page = 167 | publisher = Schoene | url = http://www.attalus.org/translate/eusebius1.html#167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Strabo]] | title = Geographica | page = 17.1.11 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A2*.html#1.11 | publisher = University of Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt]], Ptolemy's wife.&lt;ref name= "Tyldesley"&gt;{{citation | last = Tyldesley | first = Joyce | title = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 2006 | page = 200 | isbn = 0-500-05145-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8367">A '''clerihew''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɛr|ᵻ|h|j|uː}}) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Christopher Wren]]
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about [[Humphry Davy]], came into his head during a science class.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word in print was in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

[[G. K. Chesterton]], a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

There has been newfound popularity of the form on [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Clerihew&amp;src=tyah Twitter].

==Examples==
Bentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Humphry Davy]]
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref name=First/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The original poem had the second line "Was not fond of gravy";&lt;ref name=First/&gt; but the published version has "Abominated gravy".

Other clerihews by Bentley include:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
Ought never to have occurred.
One can only wonder
At so grotesque a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
and
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]],
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

W. H. Auden's ''[[Academic Graffiti]]'' (1971) includes:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
Was completely staggered
When his bride-to-be
Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' noted Auden's work and responded:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;W. H. Auden
Suffers from acute boredom
But for his readers he's got some merry news
He's written a collection of rather bad clerihews&lt;/poem&gt;}}
A second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, [[Faber and Faber]].

Alan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his ''alma mater'', [[Sherborne School]] in England:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Turing]]
Must have been alluring
To get made a don
So early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]|page=94|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

A clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Sir James Dewar]]
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Dark Sun'' also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and [[Soviet]] nuclear spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]
Looks 
Like an ascetic
Theoretic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32509950 |title=Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |last=Rhodes |first=Richard, |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=068480400X |location=New York |pages=57, 488}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Did [[Descartes]]
Depart
With the thought
"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Other uses of the form==
The clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 ''Biography for Beginners'' with an example, entitled "Introductory Remarks", on the theme of biography itself:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The third edition of the same work, published in 1925, included a "Preface to the New Edition" in 11 [[stanza]]s, each in clerihew form. One stanza ran:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;On biographic style
(Formerly so vile)
The book has had an effect
Greater than I could reasonably expect.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Cardinal Ratzinger]]

The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
:''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.'
This means, in non-technical English:
: A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

Note 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic [[rule of tincture]], which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.

===Charges===
The charges of the arms &amp;mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &amp;mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&amp;mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&amp;mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110021140/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |archivedate=2007-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &amp;mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==

Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.&lt;ref name= "cns2005"&gt;{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.&lt;ref name="cns2005"/&gt; It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==Early controversy==
Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional [[papal tiara]].

Their arguments include:
* The use of mitres in the personal arms of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s was banned by an instruction of the Holy See in April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church | title= Instruction on the Dress, Titles, and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops, and Lesser Prelates |url= http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm |publisher=Salvador Miranda via [[Florida International University|FIU]] | accessdate= 2012-03-23|date=April 17, 1969 | quote= 28. The use of coats-of-arms by Cardinals and Bishops is permitted. The shield of the coat-of-arms must be simple and clear. The use of the crozier and mitre in the coat-of-arms is suppressed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a crozier and mitre were used as external ornaments, being placed behind the shield, beneath the clerical hat, the [[galero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm Ecclesiastical Heraldry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000802/http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of an episcopal coat-of-arms ensigned with mitre and crozier, curiously granted a few months ''after'' the official exclusion of these ornaments, is [http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html that of Bishop Colin A. MacPherson of Argyll and the Isles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803150729/http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html |date=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom - Vatikanische Gärten Papstwappen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope's arms with a tiara, Vatican Garden]]
Regardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA71 John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law''] (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.

Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place.  After the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election of Benedict XVI]], the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.

{{clear|left}}

==Later controversy==

In a 2013 interview, Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426013511/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesco Dattaro''' (c. 1495 &amp;ndash; 1576) and his son '''Giuseppe Dattaro''' (c. 1540 &amp;ndash; 1616), are the two principal builders of the most important family of [[Cremona|Cremonese]] architects of the fifteenth century. The Dattaros began their activity at the construction site of the [[Cathedral of Cremona]], joining the painters, members of the cabinet making Sacca family, and the engineer [[Antonio Melone]].

The family of '''Dezallier d'Argenville''' produced two writers and connoisseurs in the course of the 18th century.

[[File:Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  
[[File:Dézallier d’Argenville Vanghelisty.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  

==Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville==
'''Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville''' (Paris, 1 July 1680 – 29 November 1765), avocat to the [[Parlement de Paris]] and secretary to the king, was a connoisseur of gardening who laid out two for himself and his family, before writing ''La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (published anonymously, 1709; second edition, 1713), based on his experience and his reading.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: '' La theorie et la pratique du jardinage. Ou l'on traite à fond des beaux jardins appellés communément les jardins de propreté, comme sont les parterres, les bosquets, les boulingrins, &amp;c. Contenant plusieurs plans et dispositions generales de jardins; nouveaux desseins…&amp; autres ornemens servant à la décoration &amp; embélissement des jardins. Avec la manière de dresser un terrain…'' His remark "A fine garden being no less difficult to contrive and order well than a good building" suggests that he had read [[Francis Bacon]]'s essay "Of gardening".&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the illustrations were by [[Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond]], who was credited as the author in the third edition, 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Gerda Gollwitzer, "The influence of Le Nostre" in ''The French Formal Garden'', 1974, Elizabeth B. MacDougall and F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, editors (Dumbarton Oaks)&lt;/ref&gt; As the work of a gentleman rather than a gardener, as previous French books on gardening had all been, Dezallier d'Argenville's work was laid out like a treatise of architecture, addressed as much to the architect and the patron as to the practising gardener. As its title suggests, the treatise is composed of two parts: the theoretical principles of the art of fine gardening and its practical applications. The first section considers the principles of siting the ''maison de plaisance'' relative to its gardens, techniques of laying out geometric figures in parterres, [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and formal tree plantations (''[[bosquet]]s''), and the planning of garden [[pavilion]]s and the siting of sculpture, an essential element in the ''jardin français''.  The second part applies the principles in earth works, terraces and stairs, and the [[hydraulics]] necessary for constructing ''[[jeux d'eau]]'': fountains, cascades, pools (''bassins'') and canals.

His rational principles could adapt formal [[parterre]] gardening to the simplified programs available to the upper middle class,&lt;ref&gt;Previous books on gardening had presented only the grandest royal and aristocratic projects.&lt;/ref&gt; which accounts for the immense popularity of his book, which is the central document in the 18th century formal garden in the wake of [[André Le Nôtre]]. The work went through thirteen editions in France,&lt;ref&gt;And unauthorized reprints from The Hague&lt;/ref&gt; where the English mode of landscape design scarcely made itself known before the French Revolution. It was published in a German version (1731)&lt;ref&gt;''Die Gärtnerey sowohl in ihre Theorie oder Betrachtung, als Praxi oder Übung'', translated by Frantz Anton Danreitter, gardener to the [[archbishop of Salzburg]] (Gollwitzer, p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into English by the architect [[John James (architect)|John James]], as ''The Theory and Practice of Gardening'' (1712, with a 2nd edition in 1728, and a 3rd edition in 1743, when the [[English landscape garden]], might have seemed to make its formal designs passé.) Dezallier d'Argenville's ''Théorique'' in its English version introduced the [[Ha-ha]], the invisible fence, to English practice.

==Dezailler d'Argenville==
Dezailler d'Argenville was called upon to edit or contribute more than 600 entries in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], published in parts from 1751.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036 |first=Frank A. |last=Kafker: |chapter=Notices sur les auteurs des dix-sept volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie |title=Recherches sur Diderot et sur l’Encyclopédie  Année |date=1989  |volume=7 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dezallier d'Argenville's interest in [[natural history]] resulted in two treatises, on shells and minerals, ''L'histoire naturelle éclaircie dans deux de ses parties principales, la lithologie et la conchyliologie''. (Paris 1742) ''La Conchyliologie, ou Traité sur la nature des coquillages'' 1757 etc.. The connoisseurship of shells and their most colourful and fantastic form was a gentleman's occupation and a worthy inclusion in a ''cabinet de curiosités'' before it became a science under the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system]] of classification.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London in March 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27argenville%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his success in the fields of gardening and natural history, Dezallier d'Argenville was a print collector. He organised his extensive collection by subject rather than by school, as outlined in the 'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux…' that he published in the ''Mercure de France'' in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux, écrite par M. Dezallier d'Argenville, Secretaire (sic) du Roy en la Grande Chancellerie, à M. Fougeroux, Tresorier-Paeur des Rentes de l'Hôte, de Ville', "Mercure de France", June 1727, pp. 1294–1330.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the 'Lettre', which takes the form of an article, Dezallier d'Argenville describes 'Three volumes containing the clothing and fashion of the different nations of the world', and a further volume documenting costumes from his native France. The sale of Dezallier's property, which took place on 3 March 1766 following his death in 1765, mentions within these volumes a total of 1,600 costume prints from the time of King Charles II until 1730. It also describes 'good prints by le Clerc, Picart, Hollar, Royn de Hoog and several Chinese drawings.'&lt;ref&gt;P. Remy, Catalogue raisonné des tableaux, estampes, coquilles, &amp; autres curiosités ; après le décès de feu M. Dezalier d'Argenville maître des comptes, &amp; membre des sociétés royales des sciences de Londres &amp; Monpellier, Paris, 3 March 1766, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; All four volumes are now located at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pullins, 'Dezallier d'Argenville's ''Recueils'' of Costume Prints Rediscovered', ''Print Quarterly'', Vol. XXXIII, No. 2 (June 2016): p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville==
{{Anchor|Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville}}&lt;!-- target of a redirect --&gt;
His son, '''Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville''' (1723–1796), was the anonymous author ''(M. D***.)'' of ''Voyage Pictoresque de Paris; ou Indication de tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans cette grande Ville en Peinture, Sculpture, &amp; Architecture'', which appeared in Paris in 1749, a connoisseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of Paris, with accounts of the leading academic and scientific organisations of the city. At least six further editions appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1752, 1757, 1765, 1770, 1778, 1780). A ''Voyage pittoresque des environs de Paris, ou Description des Maisons Royales, Châteaux &amp; autres Lieux de Plaisance, situés à quinze lieues aux environs de cette Ville '' by the same author appeared in Paris in 1755, a connoiseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of the surroundings of Paris in which the author especially paid a tribute to the triumphe of gardening. At least one further edition appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1768, 3rd edition).

Further works were ''Dénombrement de tous les fossiles de France'' and ''L'Oryctologie ou Traité des pierres, des minéraux et autres fossiles''.

He compiled also the ''Vies des Fameux Architectes Depuis la renaissance des Arts'' in two volumes, 1787, of which the second was devoted to sculptors. An abridged edition (''Abrégé de la vie...'') was often reprinted. A facsimile was published in Geneva 1972. He also wrote a ''Dictionnaire du jardinage, relatif à la théorie. et à la pratique de cet art'' (Paris, 1771) and a ''Manuel du jardinier ou journal de son travail distribué par mois,'' (Paris, 1772)  &lt;!--not this Dezallier d'Argenville:and contributed to the Encyclopédie by Diderot and d'Alembert.--&gt;

'''Elaine''' is a name shared by several different female characters in [[Arthurian legend]].

==Elaine of Astolat==
{{Main|Elaine of Astolat}}

Elaine of [[Astolat]], also known in some texts as Elaine the Fair or the Fair Maid of Astolat and (as ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' in [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]]'s same-titled poem) is a maiden who falls in unrequited love with Sir [[Lancelot]].

==Elaine of Benoic==
Elaine of Benoic (or Benwick) is the wife of [[King Ban]] and the mother of [[Lancelot]]. She is the sister of [[Evaine]], wife of King Bors of Gaunnes and mother of [[Sir Lionel]] and Sir [[Bors]]. Her husband dies of grief when his enemy [[Claudas]] attacks his city, and Elaine goes to attend to him. She sets the infant Lancelot down, and he is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], who raises him. Elaine sees her son for the first time in years just before she dies.

==Elaine of Corbenic==
{{main|Elaine of Corbenic}}

Elaine of [[Corbenic]] (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as "The Grail Maiden" or "Grail Bearer") is the daughter of [[Fisher King|King Pelles]] and the mother of Sir [[Galahad]] by Sir [[Lancelot]]. She first appears in the Prose Lancelot (the [[Vulgate Cycle]]), but fully emerges as a character in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur]]''. Her first significant action is showing the [[Holy Grail]] to Sir Lancelot.

==Elaine of Garlot==
Elaine of Garlot is the daughter of [[Gorlois]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], and [[Igraine]]. She is a sister of [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Morgause]] and a half-sister of [[King Arthur]]. She marries King [[Nentres of Garlot]] and has a son named [[Galeschin]], who becomes a [[Knight of the Round Table]], and a daughter named Elaine the Younger. 

Considering the actions of her sisters, she is remarkable in that she is otherwise unremarkable. It is assumed she stayed in her own lands and did little to help or hinder any of her siblings.

==Elaine of Listenoise==
Elaine of Listenoise is the daughter of King [[Pellinore]]. She kills herself after the death of her lover Sir Miles of the Laundes. 

Some modern authors, such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', combine or conflate her with Elaine of Corbenic, due to their shared name and the similarity of their fathers' names.

==Elaine the Peerless==
Elaine the Peerless is the niece of the Lord of the Fens and wife of Persides the Red of the Castle of Gazevilte.

==Elaine the Younger==
Elaine the Younger is the daughter of Elaine of Garlot and (usually) [[King Nentres]], and a niece of [[King Arthur]]. In some versions of the legend, she falls in love with Sir [[Percival]]. Other versions cast her as a child of [[King Lot]].

The '''Flag (Standard) of the President of Belarus''' ({{Lang-be|Штандар Прэзідэнта Рэспублікі Беларусь}}) is the official symbol of the [[President of Belarus]]. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the President.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus".

== Design ==
The standard's design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarusian national emblem]] in gold and red. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://old.bankzakonov.com/obsch/razdel192/time6/lavz5977.htm Decree dated March 27, 1997, creating the presidential standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the [[Independence Palace, Minsk|Independence Palace]]. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed in the halls or rooms of the Independence Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-meets-with-supreme-court-chairman-111494-2018/ Belarus President meets with Supreme Court chairman]&lt;/ref&gt; on other premises when the President of Belarus is visiting; in the hall of the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the President of Belarus; and on the vehicles of the President.

Presidential flag is also used during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gov.by/en/news_en/view/belarus-presidents-inauguration-ceremony-on-6-november-12501/ Belarus President’s inauguration ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

'''Giedroyć''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Giedraitis; [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: Гедройц; [[French language|French]]: Guedroitz) is a Polish surname, originating from the [[Giedroyć family|Giedroyć princely family]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Overview==
The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius ([[Palemonids]]), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it [[Giedraičiai]], and adopted the title Prince of Giedraičiai.

A document issued by Grand Duke [[Vytautas|Vytautas of Lithuania]] in the period 1399–1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraičiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.

The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's "central core") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).&lt;ref&gt;For a full genealogy of those two lines see [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/gotha.htm On-line Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth]] confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as "of the Princes".

Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.

==Armorial bearings==
The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus "as used by his illustrious grandfather" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).

But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.

At the English College of Arms, the arms of [[Michal Giedroyc]] (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

'''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was the first recorded [[king]] of [[Arzawa]], in the late 15th century BC. He was defeated by [[Tudhaliya I]] and [[Arnuwanda I]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia'' by Trevor Bryce&lt;/ref&gt; He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal [[Madduwatta]] at [[Zippasla]]. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.

Another '''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at [[Mira (Anatolia)|Mira]] in western [[Anatolia]], in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king [[Mašḫuiluwa]]. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma I]] married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor [[Mursili II]] if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.

Mira remained a Hittite ally against [[Uhha-Ziti]] of Arzawa; but two years after [[Mursili's eclipse]] (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from "Great-House-Father" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in [[Hittites|Hittite]] territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.

In the early 13th century BC, [[Muwatalli II]] signed a treaty with Alaksandu of [[Wilusa]]. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.

Kupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the [[Milawata letter]].

Kupanta-Kurunta apparently supported [[Hattusili III]] over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, "[[Mursili III]]". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that [[Egypt]] remained a full ally of [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'' by [[Trevor Bryce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">'''LOVEINT''' is the practice of [[intelligence service]] employees making use of their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their [[love interest]] or [[spouse]]. The term was coined in resemblance to intelligence terminology such as [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]], [[COMINT]] or [[HUMINT]].

== National Security Agency ==
The term LOVEINT originated at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where approximately one such incident has been reported per year. In 2013, eight had been reported in the past decade, and they are the lion's share of unauthorized accesses reported by the NSA.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |title=NSA offers details on 'LOVEINT' (that's spying on lovers, exes) |author=Edward Moyer |work=CNET |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHk7ld6C?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most incidents are self-reported, for example during a [[polygraph]] test. The NSA sanctions them with administrative action, up to termination of employment.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/ |title=NSA Officers Spy on Love Interests |author=Siobhan Gorman |work=Washington Wire |publisher=The Wallstreet Journal |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkHTCmo?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/ |title=LOVEINT: When NSA officers use their spying power on love interests |author=Andrea Peterson |work=The Washington Post |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkYSmlK?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/loveint-given-immense-powers-nsa-employees-super-cyber-stalked-their-crushes/ |title=‘LoveINT’: Given Immense Powers, NSA Employees Super Cyber-Stalked Their Crushes |author=Lee Ferran |work=American Broadcasting Company |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkfSDh5?url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/loveint-given-immense-powers-nsa-employees-super-cyber-stalked-their-crushes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/loveint-nsa-letter-discloses-employee-eavesdropping-girlfriends-spouses-v20709855 |title='Loveint': NSA letter discloses employee eavesdropping on girlfriends, spouses |author=National Broadcasting Company |work=National Broadcasting Company |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkoKNmP?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/loveint-nsa-letter-discloses-employee-eavesdropping-girlfriends-spouses-v20709855 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In five of the cases, the NSA employee resigned, preempting any administrative action. In two other cases, they retired.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; The worst administrative sanction handed out was "a reduction in pay for two months, a reduction in grade, and access to classified information being revoked". One case was forwarded to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], which however declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="slate-loveint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/27/loveint_how_nsa_spies_snooped_on_girlfriends_lovers_and_first_dates.html |title=Loveint: How NSA spies snooped on girlfriends, lovers, and first dates. |author=Ryan Gallagher |work=Future Tense |publisher=Slate |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHkwh19K?url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/27/loveint_how_nsa_spies_snooped_on_girlfriends_lovers_and_first_dates.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==
The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in [[London]] through, according to police, a shared political ideology,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10472632/Slavery-case-suspects-named-as-former-Maoist-collective-leaders.html "Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders"], telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the leader of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/slave-house-couple-lambeth-leaders-1970s-political-cult 'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'"], ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were not being physically restrained, but held by "invisible handcuffs" after being subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] by their captors.&lt;ref name="Standard_2"&gt;{{cite news |title=London slave women endured 30 years of beatings, brainwashing and emotional control |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/london-slave-women-endured-30-years-of-beatings-brainwashing-and-emotional-control-8956001.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |first=Justin |last=Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault. Balakrishnan appeared before Westminster magistrates on 17 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30431988 "Man charged in London 'slavery' inquiry"], BBC News, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Chanda Pattni, was released earlier in 2014, as there was considered to be insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Halliday [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/11/london-slavery-case-cps-charges-ravindan-alakrishnan "London ‘slavery’ case: CPS charges Aravindan Balakrishnan"], ''The Guardian'', 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later monarchs see [[List of Pictish kings|List of Pictish Kings]]. Fib became a puppet state after the reign of the only true king Fib, it was a sub-kingdom from the 7th century BCE until the 9th Century CE (691 BCE - 837/843 CE) when Pictland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin, the last king to rule Pictland before Kenneth was Drest X thus making him the last king of the Fib puppet-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of notable travelers''', consisting of people that are known for their travels or explorations. Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, and can be one way or round trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/travel "Travel."] (definition).

[[File:King Henry VIII from NPG (3).jpg|thumb|220px|A portrait of Henry VIII, painted c. 1520]]

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|}

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

==Katherine of Aragon==
{{Main article|Katherine of Aragon}}
[[File:Catherine aragon.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Katherine of Aragon]]
[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 1533{{spaced ndash}}17 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/boleyn/|title=Anne Boleyn|website=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==

[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinister supporter came from the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|coat of arms of her father]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who displayed his shield on the breast of a single-headed Apostolic eagle displayed. Catherine's badges were a commemoration of the [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] from the [[Emirate of Granada|Moors]], where a victory was gained by the superiority of the Spanish archers.

The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

-----
The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man In The Moon2.png|thumb|200px|Some Pareidolias in the moon]]
'''Lunar pareidolia''' refers to the [[Pareidolia|pareidolic]] images seen by humans on the face of the [[Moon]]. The Moon's surface is a complex mixture of dark areas (the [[Lunar mare|lunar ''maria'']], or "seas") and lighter areas (the highlands). Many cultures have seen shapes in these dark and light areas that have reminded them of people, animals or objects, often related to their [[folklore]]; the most famous are the [[Man in the Moon]] in Western folklore and the [[Moon Rabbit]] of Asia and the Americas. Other cultures perceive the silhouette of a [[Chang'e (mythology)|woman]], a [[frog]], a [[moose]], a [[American Bison|buffalo]], or a [[dragon]] (with its head and mouth to the right and body and wings to the left) in the full moon. Alternatively, the vague shape of the overall dark and light regions can resemble a [[Taijitu|Yin Yang symbol]].

==The Man in the Moon==
{{Main article|Man in the Moon}}
[[File: Man in the Moon with key.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One possible interpretation of the Man in the Moon as seen from the Northern Hemisphere]]
The Man in the Moon is an imaginary figure resembling a human face, head or body, that observers from some cultural backgrounds typically perceive in the bright disc of the [[full moon]].

==Rabbit/hare==
{{Main article|Moon rabbit}}
[[File:Rabbit in the moon standing by pot.png|thumb|150px|Rabbit with a pot – making medicine, [[mochi]], or [[tteok]]]]

In [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], the rabbit in the moon (a companion of [[Chang'e (mythology)|Chang'e]]) is pounding medicine. Similarly, in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], popular culture sees a rabbit making [[mochi]] and [[tteok]], respectively, in the moon.

In [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] the rabbit is often associated with the moon, for example, [[Tecciztecatl]], the [[Aztec]] moon god, was pictured as an anthropomorphic rabbit; there is also a myth involving [[Quetzalcoatl]] and the moon rabbit.

==Female figures==
In [[Elizabethan England]], the spots of the Moon were supposed to represent a witch carrying sticks of wood on her back, or an old man with a lantern (which was illustrated by [[Shakespeare]] in his comedy ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''). A more recent Western image is the profile of a coiffed woman wearing a jeweled pendant, the jewel being the crater [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]], which at full moon is very bright and has bright radiating lines ([[Ray system|rays]]). In New Zealand [[Māori mythology|Māori legend]], the moon shows a woman with a local tree, the ''[[Myoporum laetum#Maori legend|Ngaio]]''. However, throughout [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]], the moon is seen to be a cook over a three-stone fire.

In [[Chinese Mythology]], [[Chang'e]] (various spellings) lives on the moon. She was mentioned in the conversation between Houston Capcom and [[Apollo 11]] crew just before the first moon landing:&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarchy-manga.com/Onions/onion-club-manga-emoticons-wallpapers.php Onion-Club, Chang-e, About the Moon Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305233856/http://anarchy-manga.com/Onions/onion-club-manga-emoticons-wallpapers.php |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Houston]]: Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called ''Chang-o'' has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the moon because she stole the pill for immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is only standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not recorded.&lt;br&gt;

==Toad==
"The toad was seen by Chinese Taoists as ... the moon, representing Chang-O, the transformed wife of Yi, the excellent archer. ... According to Robert M. DeGraaff, in some representations of the moon-toad, the ''ling chih'' fungus is shown growing out of the creature's forehead."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yXPXTbrJULgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=Cheng-o+toad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NVyvO2GFTz&amp;sig=WipE6K8JaB9Mrv8Yjl49349ab6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oZyhSaKlLZ6Dtwfsh836DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Adrian Morgan : ''Toads and Toadstools''. Celestial Arts, 1995]. {{ISBN|0-89087-777-7}}. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ali==
[[Shia Muslims]] believe that the name of [[Ali]] Ibne-Abi Talib ([[Muhammad]]'s son in law) is written on the moon. This interpretation has roots in several [[hadith]] by Muhammad where he compares Ali to the moon and himself to the sun. There are also other esoteric interpretations of this analogy in Islamic philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10188">[[File:Magnes the shepherd.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Magnes the shepherd from a 19th-century text]]
'''Magnes the shepherd''', sometimes described as '''Magnes the shepherd boy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Herald|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44791889/|page=23|title=Compasses Invented by Chinese|date=November 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythological figure, possibly based on a real person, who was cited by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 CE – 79 CE) as discovering [[Natural remanent magnetization|natural magnetism]]. His name, "Magnes", the Latin word for ''[[magnetite]]'', has been attributed as the origin of the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root]] that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words ''[[magnet]]'', ''[[magnetism]]'', the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.

As set out in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ("Natural History"), an early [[encyclopedia]] published c. 77&amp;nbsp;CE – c. 79&amp;nbsp;CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Anna Marie|title=The Correspondence of Dr. Martin Lister (1639–1712). Volume One: 1662–1677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aByoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-26332-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as translated from the Latin in [[Robert Jacobus Forbes]]' ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to [[Nicander|Nicander of Colophon]]):&lt;ref name ="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert Jacobus|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|volume=IX|year=1964|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=179|oclc=180355272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida{{Cref2|note 1}} and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.&lt;ref name ="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The passage appears at Book XXXVI of ''Naturalis Historia'', covering "The Natural History of Stones", at chapter 25 entitled "The Magnet: Three Remedies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|translator=John Bostock|translator2=H. T. Riley|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355|volume=VI|year=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|page=355|chapter=The Magnet: Three Remedies|location=London|oclc=615995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Gillian|title=North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCC0lAtU_0C&amp;pg=PA6|year=2011|publisher=Awa Press|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-1-61519-132-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been [[Lost work|lost]].&lt;ref name="Colophon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicander of Colophon|title=Poems and Poetical Fragments|editors=Translated by A.S.F.

Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India.&lt;ref name="Etymologiae"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=2006|orig-year=source text c. 600 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45616-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is repeated in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' ''Miroir du Monde'' (c. 1250 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monthly literary register|title=The Monthly magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2kEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571|year=1833|publisher=Charles Tilt|location=London|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, ''Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones'', wherein he describes Magnes as a "shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of [[lodestone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicols|first=Thomas|title=Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones: With Cautions for the Undeceiving of All Those that Deal with Pretious Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=1652|publisher=Thomas Buck|location=Cambridge|page=196|oclc=12968778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as ''magnetite'', ''magnet'', ''magnetism'', ''[[magnesium]]'', ''[[manganese]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weicker|first=Theodore|title=Merck Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|volume=X|year=1901|publisher=Merck &amp; Company|location=New York|page=289|chapter=The Myth of Pliny|oclc=243874912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] ([[circa|c.]] 99&amp;nbsp;BCE – c. 55&amp;nbsp;BCE), have attributed the [[etymology]] of ''magnet'', and progeny, to the name of the [[Lydians|Lydian]] city, [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]] ([[Manisa|Manisa, Turkey]] in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deer|first=William Alexander|title=Rock-forming Minerals: Non-silicates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASjwAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=69|oclc=174165277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allom|first1=Thomas|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert |title=Constantinople and the scenery of the seven churches of Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8-IA6|year=1839|publisher=Fisher, son, &amp; Co|location=London|page=10|oclc=332119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the [[Ionia]]n city of [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia ad Maeandrum]].&lt;ref name="Senning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senning|first=Alexander|title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology: The Whys and Whences of Chemical Nomenclature and Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PA240|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-08-048881-3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of ''magnet'', et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book ''North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism'' (2011) as "no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt; In the 1896 treatise ''Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity'', the authors write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name "Magnet" is, no doubt, due to this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Henry|author2=W. Stepney Rawson|title=Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V21YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1896|publisher=Ward, Lock and Co.|location=London|page=4|oclc=8158356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]
In several cultures, a '''middle name''' is a portion of a [[personal name]] that is written between the person's [[given name]] and their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a "middle name", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): 
* part of a two-word given name (e.g. ''[[Mary Anne]]'', about [[Mary Anne Clarke]], and "[[Joe Bob Briggs]]"), 
* a [[maiden name]] (e.g. [[Hillary Clinton|Rodham]]), 
* a [[patronymic]] (e.g. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Sergeyevich]]), 
* a [[baptismal name]] (e.g. "Christopher" invoking [[Saint Christopher]]), or
* a maternal [[surname]] (such as in Portuguese and Brazilian names).
 
In the [[United States]], such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, [[patronymic]]s, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the "middle name" is often [[abbreviated]] to the '''middle initial''' (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for [[signature]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688–1766).

Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical ''[[Harvardiana]]''.

The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} by the increased use of [[software|computer]] [[database]]s that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such [[databases]] under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like [[María del Pilar Pereyra]] or [[María de las Nieves García]].

The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.

Since 1905, "middle name" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."

==English==
In countries that primarily speak English—such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage.&lt;ref name=genfiles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genfiles.com/articles/middle-names/ | title=The Use of Middle Names| date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.&lt;ref name=genfiles/&gt;

In the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an [[initial]], e.g. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was [[Harry S. Truman]]. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | title=Truman: The "S" Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the "upper classes" and "middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nameberry.com/blog/british-baby-names-two-middle-names | title=British Baby Names: Two middle names| date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[J.

Middle names can also be used as first names.

=== Chinese ===
{{Further|Chinese name|Generation name|Courtesy name|Art name}}
Traditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (''ming''), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage.  Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family.  For example, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] has the given name ''Yinzhen'' (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character "Yin" (胤).  His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character ''Hong'' (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors.  In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the [[One-child_policy|One-child Policy]], there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

A fading Chinese tradition is to use a [[courtesy name]], called ''zì'' (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood.  Traditionally ''zì'' is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old.  This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect.  Like the ''ming'', the ''zì'' is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the ''ming''.  Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their ''zì''.  An alternative courtesy name is the ''hào'' ({{zh|s=号|t=號|p=hào|labels=no}}; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A ''hào'' was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's ''míng'' or ''zì''; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the ''hào'' to refer to themselves. The ''zì'' or ''hào'' can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.

Some [[Chinese American]]s move their Chinese given name ([[Romanization of Chinese|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]]) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. [[James Soong|James Chu-yu Soong]], [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang]], and [[Michelle Kwan|Michelle Wingshan Kwan]]. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] names, such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.

The practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.

In the example [[Carl Viggo Manthey Lange]], the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used [[patronymic]]s until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.

In [[Sweden]], the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called "tilläggsnamn" (additional name), and are called "mellannamn" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.

Furthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish ("mellannamn") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'')), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]] has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.

In Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'').

==Southeast Asia==

===Vietnam===

{{Further|Vietnamese name}}

Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are "Văn" for male names and "Thị" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially "Thị". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names ([[unisex name]]s are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

===Philippines===
{{further information|Filipino name}}

For Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used [[Spanish naming customs]], that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle ''y'' (or ''e'', before "i"), which remains in use but became restricted to  very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name ''Juan Santos Macaraig'', with ''Santos'' the middle name in the present order, may become ''Juan S. Macaraig'' with the middle name abbreviated, and ''Juan Macaraig y Santos'' in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official [[mug shot]]s. The Philippine system, using "given name-middle name-surname" order (or "Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname") coincidentally follows the [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.

But, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in ''[[Jose P.  Laurel]]'', where "P." (a middle initial)  corresponds to ''Paciano''.

In illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. 

To illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named ''Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala'' and ''Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada'', named '"Maria Cristina'", will be named ''Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz''), with Ana Cristina's middle name,  ''dela Cruz'', as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname ''Lozada'', but keep the maternal surmame ''Manansala'' as middle name, thus, ''Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. Lozada''). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called ''Maria Cristina Lozada'' or ''Ma. Cristina Lozada'', even when the mother is known.

In married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco''), once marrying ''Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan'' (or ''Juan Pablo S. Marasigan'') may take the name ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P.  Limchauco-Marasigan''), maintaining the maternal surname ''Perez'', ''Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan''), taking the maiden surname ''Limchauco'' as middle name and ''Marasigan'' as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' upon marriage.

== Latin America ==
In Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed "segundo nombre" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/segundo-nombre-pasa-moda-usa-poner-solo_0_ryME5BGvb.html | title=El segundo nombre pasa de moda: Se usa poner sólo uno}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Actually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).

The '''Munros of Auchinbowie''' (sometimes spelt Monro) are a distinguished branch of the [[Scotland|Scottish]], highland [[Clan Munro]]. From this family three Professors of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland were produced, as well as several other doctors and military officers.

==Lineage==
===17th century===
[[File:Monro_RCSEd.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] the surgeon of Edinburgh University whose descendants later succeeded to the Auchinbowie property]]
The progenitor of the Munros of Auchinbowie is generally regarded as [[Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts]] who served as a major in an infantry regiment and saw action at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651.  He later took up a career of politics. His ancestry can be traced to [[Munro of Milntown|Andrew Munro, 4th of Milntown]] who descends from [[Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis]] (d.1425), an early chief of the Clan Munro of Ross-shire, Scotland.

Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts had seven children:

#[[George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie]] (1666–1721) who was famed for his victory over the Jacobites at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in 1689.  He came into ownership of Auchinbowie, a property about four miles south of [[Stirling]] through his wife Margaret Bruce of Auchinbowie. Later as a Major in Sir Charles Graham's Regiment of Foot he fought at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)]].   
#Archibald Munro born in 1666 and died in 1697.
#[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] a surgeon at the [[University of Edinburgh]], whose descendants would later succeed to the estates of Auchinbowie.
#Margaret Munro.
#Lillias Munro.
#Jean Munro. Married William, second son of Sir William Sempil of Cathcart.
#Mary Munro.

===18th century===
George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie had three children:
[[File:Auchibowie House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Auchinbowie House, near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]]]
#Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie who married Anne, daughter of [[Stewart Baronets|Sir Robert Stewart, Lord Tillicoultry]] in 1719.
#[[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (1700–1757) who was a British Army officer famed for his resolute but ultimately unsuccessful defense of [[Fort William Henry]] in 1757 during the [[Seven Years' War]] / [[French and Indian War]] which was made famous by the novel and later the film ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. However, when [[John Alexander Inglis]] wrote his history of the Monro of Auchinbowie family in 1911, he had not at that time identified the younger George Monro as a member of the family.&lt;ref name="Inglis2"&gt;Holden, James A. and Inglis, John Alexander. (1913). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42889472?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Lineage of Colonel George Monro - Proceedings of the New York State Historical Association]''. '''Volume 13'''. pp. 389 - 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Margaret Munro - born 1707.

Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie (d.1742)  had nine children: 
#George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie (1721–1793) who was an army surgeon who served in the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Highlanders]] otherwise known as the ''Black Watch'' under the chief of the Clan Munro; Colonel [[Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet]]. In 1750 George was Surgeon in [[William Maule, 1st Earl Panmure]]'s [[25th Regiment of Foot]]. He saw active service in Germany and afterwards in the war against the French in America. In 1781 he was appointed Physician General to the garrison in [[Menorca]] and went through six months siege by the French and Spanish.
#Alexander Munro, a writer in [[Edinburgh]]. (1724–1750).
#John Munro.
#Cecil Munro. (1719–1786)
#Five other children - all died young.

George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had two sons:

#Major George Munro who married Elizabeth Aylmer. They had two sons and one daughter.
#[[Hector William Munro|Lieutenant-General Hector William Munro, 1st of Edmondsham]] (d. 1821) was [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor of Trinidad]] and who married Philadelphia Bower of [[Edmondsham]]. They had three sons and four daughters.

==Alexander Monro (primus)==
[[File:Alexander Monro primus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''primus'', 4th of Auchinbowie]]
Although George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had male heirs as mentioned above, he sold the Auchinbowie property to a cousin, [[Alexander Monro (primus)]] who was the son of [[John Monro (surgeon)]], who was in turn a younger brother of George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie. Alexander Monro (primus) was the founder of the [[Edinburgh Medical School]].  He was appointed lecturer on [[Anatomy]] by the Surgeons' Company at [[Edinburgh]] in 1719; two years later he became professor, and in 1725 was admitted to the [[University of Edinburgh|University]]. He was a principal promoter and early clinical lecturer in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. Alexander Monro (primus) had six children:

#[[John Monro (advocate)|John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie]], advocate, born 5 November 1725 and married Sophia, eldest daughter of Archibald Inglis of Auchindinny. He died in May 1789.
#[[Donald Monro (doctor)|Dr Donald Monro]] (1728–1802), married Dorothea Maria Heineken.
#Jean Monro (1729–1731).
#Mary Monro - born 1730.
#[[Alexander Monro (secundus)]], 1st of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1733–1817)
#Margaret Monro (1757–1802).

==Alexander Monro (secundus)==
[[File:Alexander Munro secundus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''secundus'']]
Alexander Monro (primus) was succeeded in the property of Auchibowie by his eldest son John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie who was in turn succeeded by a daughter. However he was succeeded in his profession by his third son [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]] who was Professor of Anatomy in [[Edinburgh]]. He took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1775. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in [[London]], where he attended the lectures of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]]. He next visited [[Paris]] and on 17 September 1757 entered [[Leiden University]] where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, [[Bernhard Siegfried Albinus]] and [[Petrus Camper]]. However his foreign studies were principally prosecuted at [[Berlin]], where he worked under the celebrated Professor Meckel, in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. He finally was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] on 2 May 1758 and as a Fellow on 1 May 1759. He had four children:

#Isabella Monro who married Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cott of Gala. She died in 1801.
#[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]], 2nd of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1773–1859).
#David Monro (1776–1843).
#Charlotte Monro (1782–1822).

==Alexander Monro (tertius)==
[[File:Alexander Munro tertius.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''tertius'']]
[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]] followed his father and grandfather in becoming professor of anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Amongst his publications are "Outlines of the Anatomy of the Human Body" (1811) in four volumes and "Elements of Anatomy" (1825) in two volumes. He was Secretary of the Royal College of Physicians from 1809 to 1819 and President in 1827 and 1828. He was also on the Council of the [[Wernerian Natural History Society]] of which he became a member in 1811. He had been elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798 and at his death was father of the Society. He had 12 children:

#Alexander Monro (1803–1867), was a Captain in the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]], married Elizabeth, daughter of C. B Scott of Woll.
#James Monro (1806–1870), was a Surgeon-Major in the [[Coldstream Guards]], married Maria, daughter of Colonel Duffin.
#Henry Monro (1810–1869), married Jane Christie. One of their sons was [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet]]
#[[David Monro|Sir David Monro]] (1813–1877), married Dinah, daughter of John Secker. They had five sons including [[Charles John Monro]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright-St Clair, Rex. "Monro, David 1813 - 1877". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;
#William Munro (1815–1881), a Major in the 79th [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]], married Elizabeth, daughter of [[Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet]].
#Charles Monro (1818–1820).
#Maria Monro (1801–1884), married John Inglis of Auchinderry and Redhall.
#Catherine Monro (1804–1868), married Sir John James Steuart of Allanbank.

#Harriet Monro (181 - 1989), married her cousin Alex Binning Monro who was a descendant of [[John Monro (advocate)|John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie]], their son [[David Binning Monro]] was [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]].
#Isabella Monro (1819–1908)
#Charlotte Monro (1821–1908), married Henry Fletcher.

Even before the [[early modern period]], a man who did not have a family coat of arms would assume one upon becoming a bishop, as men did when knighted&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s4RZnW-B0-wC&amp;pg=PA342 David Brewster, ''The Edinburgh Encyclopædia'' (Routledge 1999] {{ISBN|978-0-41518026-9}}), vol. 1, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; or on achieving some other prominence.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] (1364 – c. 1430), [https://books.google.com/books?id=epXQh7B1w20C&amp;pg=PA216 ''The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry'' (English translation: Penn State Press 1999] {{ISBN|9780271043050}}, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Some who already had an episcopal coat of arms altered it on being elected to the papal throne.&lt;ref name=BXVI/&gt; The last pope who was elected without already being a bishop was [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1831 and the last who was not even a priest when elected was [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513.&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"&gt;[http://www.religionnews.com/2013/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-popes-and-conclaves/ Religion News Service, "Popes and conclaves: everything you need to know"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==External ornaments==
[[File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 022.jpg|thumb|Arms of [[Innocent VIII]] (Giovanni Battista Cybo, 1484-1492) as shown in the contemporary  [[Wernigerode Armorial]]. The coat of arms of the House of Cybo is here shown with the papal tiara and two keys ''argent'' in one of the earliest examples of these external ornaments of a papal coat of arms ([[Pope Nicholas V]] in 1447 was the first to adopt two silver keys as the charges of his adopted coat of arms).&lt;ref name=Collenberg693/&gt;]]

Papal coats of arms are traditionally shown with an image of the [[papal tiara]] and the [[keys of Peter]] as an external ornament of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. The tiara is usually set above the escutcheon, while the keys are in saltire, passing behind it (formerly also ''en cimier'', below the tiara and above the shield). In modern times, the dexter and sinister keys are usually shown in gold ([[or (heraldry)|or]]) and silver ([[argent]]), respectively. The first depiction of a tiara, still with a single coronet, in connection with papal arms, is on the tomb of [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]] (d. 1303) in the basilica of S. John Lateran.&lt;ref name="p. 151"&gt;John Woodward, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'', 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/atreatiseoneccl00woodgoog#page/n246/mode/2up p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] in 2005 deviated from tradition in replacing the tiara with the [[mitre]] and [[pallium]] (see [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI]]).

The two keys have been given the interpretation of representing the  power to bind and to loose on earth (silver) and in heaven (gold), in reference to {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18-19|ESV}}:
:"You are [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
The gold key signifies that the power reaches to heaven and the silver key that it extends to all the faithful on earth, the interlacing indicating the linking between the two aspects of the power, and the arrangement with the handles of the keys at the base symbolizes that the power is in the hands of the pope.&lt;ref name="Heaven p. 54"&gt;"The symbolism of the keys is brought out in an ingenious and interpretative fashion by heraldic art. One of the keys is of gold , the other of silver. The golden key, which points upwards on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] side, signifies the power that extends even to Heaven. The silver key, which must point up to the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] side, symbolizes the power over all the faithful on earth. The two are often linked by a cordon [[Gules (heraldry)|Gules]] as a sign of the union of the two powers. The handles are turned downwards, for they are in the hand of the Pope, Christ's lieutenant on earth. The wards point upwards, for the power of binding and loosing engages Heaven itself." Bruno Bernhard Heim, ''Heraldry in the Catholic Church: Its Origin, Customs and Laws'' (Van Duren 1978 {{ISBN|9780391008731}}), p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known representation of the crossed keys beneath the papal tiara in the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|Coats of arms of the Holy See]] dates from the time of [[Pope Martin V]] (1417–1431).  His successor [[Pope Eugene IV]] (1431–1447) included it in the design of a silver coin.&lt;ref name=Ceresa&gt;[http://www.lucisullest.it/dett_news_print.php?id=3823 Claudio Ceresa, "Una sintesi di simboli ispirati alla Scrittura" on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', 10 August 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218091006/http://www.lucisullest.it/dett_news_print.php?id=3823 |date=18 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Martin V also included the keys in his personal arms (those of the [[Colonna family]]); however he did not show them as external ornaments, instead placing them [[Chief (heraldry)|in chief]] on the shield (this example was followed by Urban V and VIII and Alexander VII; Nicolas V seems to have used just the crossed keys and the tiara in an escutcheon. The placing of the keys above the shield becomes the fashion in the early 16th century, so shown on the tomb of [[Pope Pius III|Pius III]] (d. 1503). [[Pope Adrian VI|Adrian VI]] (1522/3) placed the keys in saltire behind the shield.&lt;ref name="Woodward153"&gt;John Woodward, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'', 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/atreatiseoneccl00woodgoog#page/n248/mode/2up p. 153f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Middle Ages==
[[File:A03 ADRIANO IV.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Adrian IV]] (d. 1159, born Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman to occupy the papal throne) did not use a personal coat of arms; Nevertheless, he was given attributed arms (showing a broken spear) in this 17th-century portrait.]]
[[Heraldry]] developed out of military insignia from the time of the [[First Crusade]]. 

The first papal coats of arms appeared when heraldry began to be codified in the 12th to 13th centuries. 
At first, the popes simply used the secular coat of arms of their family. 
Thus, [[Pope Innocent IV]] (1243-1254), who was born Sinibaldo Fieschi, presumably used the Fieschi coat of arms, as did [[Adrian V]] (Ottobon de Fieschi), the nephew of Innocent IV.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
According to Michel Pastoureau, [[Pope Innocent IV]] (1243-1254) is likely the first who displayed personal arms, but the first of whom a contemporary coat of arms survives is [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1294-1303).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Michel Pastoureau | title=Traité d'Héraldique | edition=3&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; édition | publisher=Picard | year=1997 | isbn=2-7084-0520-9 | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern sources show [[attributed arms]]  of the popes of the second half of the 12th century; thus, editions of the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' of the 1960s presented the arms of the popes beginning with [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198-1216),&lt;ref name="AP1969"&gt;"Stemmi dei Sommi Pontefici dal sec. XII ad oggi" in ''Annuario Pontificio 1969'' (Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, Vatican City 1969), pp. 23*-27*&lt;/ref&gt; and John Woodward gave those of the popes from [[Pope Lucius II]] (1144-1145) onward, though he noted that "it seems probably that many of the early Popes made little if any use of their family arms".&lt;ref name=Woodward/&gt;
Thus, Innocent III (Lothaire de Segni, 1160-1216) and Gregory IX (Ugolin de Segni, 1145-1241) may have used the coat of arms of the Counts of [[Segni]].&lt;ref name="heraldique-europeenne.org"&gt;So presented at [http://www.heraldique-europeenne.org/Regions/Italie/Papes_2.htm heraldique-europeenne.org] and [http://www.araldicavaticana.com/innocenzo_3.htm araldicavaticana.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following papal coat of arms should be considered ''traditional'', lacking contemporary attribution. 
For the popes of noble families, the coats of arms of the family is substituted, and for commoners, the traditional coat of arms as shown in early modern heraldic sources.

==Popes of the modern period==
The last person elected as pope who was not already an ordained priest or monk was [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (Giovanni di Lorenzo de' [[Medici]]) in 1513. Thus, throughout the Early Modern period, the elected pope already had a coat of arms: if he did not have a family coat of arms to begin with, he would have adopted one upon being made bishop. Upon his election as pope, he would continue using his pre-existing coat of arms, in some cases with [[Augmentation of honour|heraldic augmentations]]. This tradition was continued into the modern period.

When he became [[Patriarch of Venice]] in 1893, he added the chief of Venice (the [[Lion of St. Mark]]), changing the field from gules (red) to argent (white) to make the heraldic point that this was the "religious emblem of St. Mark's Lion and not the insignia [of the former Republic of Venice]". When he was elected pope in 1903, heraldists expected him to  again drop the chief of Venice, but Sarto did not change his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Cardinal Jacques. Heraldry in the Vatican.

When a bishop and cardinal Pacelli's arms depicted a dove displayed (''i.e.'', with its wings spread) holding an olive branch in its beak, a reference to his surname, which means "peace". The dove was perched on a trimount and sitting below the arc of a rainbow, an allusion to the story of [[Noah]]. After his election to the papacy, the dove was changed to be depicted with folded wings, the rainbow was removed, and the trimount placed atop a green field above waves of water.

The chief containing St. Mark's lion reflects not only his own service as [[Patriarch of Venice]] (1969), but also that of John XXIII (and Pius X, who also used this chief in his own arms).  Cardinal Luciani's original arms replaced the fleurs-de-lis above the collee in his immediate predecessor's arms with four-pointed stars; when Luciani was elevated to Pope they were modified to become five-pointed stars which are a heraldic symbol of Our Lady, specifically of the Assumption.

"The coat of arms for Pope John Paul II is intended to be a homage to the central mystery of Christianity, that of Redemption. It mainly represents a cross, whose form however does not correspond to any of the usual heraldry models. The reason for the unusual shift of the vertical part of the cross is striking, if one considers the second object included in the Coat of Arms: the large and majestic capital M, which recalls the presence of the Madonna under the Cross and Her exceptional participation in Redemption. The Pontiff’s intense devotion to the Holy Virgin is manifested in this manner."  ''[[L’Osservatore Romano]]'', 9 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==

{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary.

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==

{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle and last/family/surname with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]

A '''personal name''' or '''full name''' is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a [[word-group]], with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the ''[[birth name]]'' or ''[[legal name]]'' of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called [[anthroponymy]].

In [[Western culture]], nearly all individuals possess at least one ''[[given name]]'' (also known as a ''first name'', ''forename'', or ''Christian name''), together with a ''[[surname]]'' (also known as a ''last name'' or ''family name'')—respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in [[Abraham Lincoln]]—the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan.  Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.

Another naming convention that is used mainly in the [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. Also note that the wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2005|title=The Arabic Naming System|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v28n1p020-021.pdf|journal=Councilscienceeditors.org|language=en|volume=28| issue = 1|pages=20–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s. For instance, as a middle name as with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with [[Björk Guðmundsdóttir]] (whose father was named Guðmundur) or [[Heiðar Helguson]] (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in [[Eastern world|Eastern]] cultures.

However, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be [[mononymous person|mononymous]]. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the [[Machiguenga people|Machiguenga]] of the Amazon, do not use personal names.{{efn-lr|The Machiguenga may have nicknames, but generally refer to each other by how they are related. They may disambiguate with biographical information, such as "sister, the one who slipped in the river".&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Wayne W (1964). Kinship relations in Machiguenga. pp. 17–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Allen W. ''Families of the forest: the Matsigenka Indians of the Peruvian Amazon''. [[University of California Press]], 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_JXC70OnxEgC&amp;pg=PA9 pp. 9–10]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on April 1, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-520-23242-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person's full name usually identifies that person for legal and administrative purposes, although it may not be the name by which the person is commonly known; some people use only a portion of their full name, or are known by titles, nicknames, [[pseudonym]]s or other formal or informal designations.

It is nearly universal for people to have names; the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] declares that a child has the right to a name from birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Text of the Convention on the Rights of the Child], Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989 entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with article 49, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Common components of names given at birth include:
* Personal name: The [[given name]] (or [[acquired name]] in some cultures)  can precede a [[family name]] (as in some European cultures), or it can come after the family name (as in some East Asian cultures), or be used without a family name.
* [[Patronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the father.
* [[Matronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the mother.
* [[Family name]]: A name used by all members of a family. In [[China]], surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In [[Europe]], after the loss of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system]], the common use of family names started quite early in some areas ([[France]] in the 13th century, and [[Germany]] in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Wales]], and some areas of [[Germany]], as well as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used [[patronymic]]s, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923) in [[Norway]], and [[Iceland]] still [[Icelandic name|does not use surnames]] for its native inhabitants. In [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named António de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as [[António Guterres]]. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] is often called [[Zapatero]]. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.
* In many families, single or multiple [[middle name]]s are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] families choose a [[saint]]'s name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]] when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.

Some people (called ''anonyms'') choose to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]], that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a [[pseudonym]].

For some people, their name is a single word, known as a [[mononym]]. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], of the magician duo [[Penn and Teller]], was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply "Teller". In some official government documents, such as his [[driver's license]], his given name is listed as ''NFN'', an acronym for "no first name".

The [[Inuit]] believe that the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the [[namesake]]s are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (''atiq''), but also by [[kinship]] title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In [[Judaism]], someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the [[Death (personification)#In Judaism|Angel of Death]] may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among [[Sephardi Jews]]). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the [[goyim|Gentile]] world.

Chinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]] and [[Japanese emperor]]s receive [[posthumous name]]s.

In some [[Polynesian culture]]s, the name of a deceased chief becomes [[taboo]]. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.

Depending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes [[title]]s) are considered part of the name.

==Feudal names==
{{Disputed section|date=February 2013}}

The [[royal family|royalty]], [[nobility]], and [[gentry]] of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in [[small capital]] letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]&lt;/span&gt;. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.

The bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word "Gloucester" in "What will Gloucester do?" meant the [[Duke of Gloucester]]). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the [[Royal Navy]] meant its captain (e.g., "Cressy didn't learn from Aboukir") while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., "The ''Cressy'' is foundering").

==Naming conventions==
A personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consists of one more parts, such as [[given name]], [[surname]] and [[patronymic]]. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of [[anthroponymy]].

In contemporary Western societies (except for [[Iceland]], [[Hungary]], and sometimes [[Flanders]], depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a [[given name]], which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents' [[family name]].  Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture.  Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas.  This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. [[George (given name)|George]], [[Georg (disambiguation)|Georg]], [[Jorge]]), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.

In earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called "X's son/daughter"; this is now the case only in [[Iceland]] and was recently re-introduced as an option in the [[Faroe Islands]]. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob's Son). In [[Kafirstan]] (now part of Pakistan) "Children are named as soon as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is thereafter known." &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Kafiristan] Encyclopedia Britannica, [[George Scott Robertson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a range of personal naming systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Patrick|last1= Hanks|first2=Harry|last2= Parkin |editor= Carole Hough|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S8DQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 |chapter= Family names |title= The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming  |location= New York |year= 2016 |publisher=  Oxford University Press |page=214 |isbn= 9780191630415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Binomial systems: apart for given name, people are described by their surnames, which they obtain from one of their parents. Most modern European personal naming systems, such as [[Russian name|Russian]] and [[Spanish name|Spanish]], are of this type.
* Patronymic systems: apart for given name, people are described by their [[patronymic]]s, that is given names (not surnames) of parents or other ancestors. Such systems were in wide use throughout Europe in the first millennium C.E., but were replaced by binomial systems. [[Icelandic name|Icelandic system]] is still patronymic.
* More complex systems like [[Arabic name|Arabic system]], consisting of [[paedonymic]] (son's name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.

Different cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.

== Name order ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Given name]] and [[Family name]] --&gt;
[[File:MomoiExpoCrop.png|thumb|[[Haruko Momoi]] at the [[Anime Expo]] 2007 in [[Los Angeles]]; her name card features a spelling of her [[Japanese name|name]] ("Halko Momoi") written in Western order; in Japanese her name is {{Nihongo2|桃井はるこ}} ''Momoi Haruko'']]

===Western name order===
The order ''given name, family name'' is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most [[Europe]]an countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] [[Americas|America]], [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[Central India|Central]] and [[Western India|West India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]]).

Within alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a [[comma]] (e.g. Smith, John), representing the "lexical name order". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.

===Eastern name order===
The order ''family name, given name'' is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in [[East Asia]] (for example in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]), as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] [[Cambodia]] and [[South India|Southern]] and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]] (the original [[Hungarian prehistory|homeland of the Hungarians]] was likely in Asia, at the southern foothills of the [[Ural Mountains]]). 
It is common in popular use also in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]], as well as in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Romania]], possibly because of the influence of the bureaucratic use of putting the family name before the given name.

When East Asian names are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in [[letter case|capital letters]]. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).

Chinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013}} Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle''. [[M.E. Sharpe]], 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&amp;pg=PA632&amp;dq=%22Japanese+names%22+surname&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3GU_TqC1OaLFsQKvq_22AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Japanese%20names%22%20surname&amp;f=false 632]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on August 7, 2011. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}, {{ISBN|9780765603562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular journalism publications, western order is used for Japanese names.&lt;ref name="Saeki"&gt;Saeki, Shizuka. "First Name Terms." ''[[Look Japan]]''. June 2001. Volume 47, No. 543. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese names of contemporary individuals and Hungarian names are usually "switched" when individuals who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, ''Koizumi Jun'ichirō'' is known as [[Junichiro Koizumi]] in English, and Puskás Ferenc is known as [[Ferenc Puskás]]. But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, Máo Zédōng is known as [[Mao Zedong]] in English.

Names of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see [[Ichiro Suzuki]] instead of ''Suzuki Ichirō'' (although he is widely known simply as "Ichiro" in both Japan and North America), or [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] instead of ''Nakata Hidetoshi''. As for Chinese sportspeople, ''Yáo Míng'' is [[Yao Ming]] and ''Liú Xiáng'' is [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Names of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean [[football (soccer)|footballers]] and [[Sportsperson|athletes]] are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. [[Ahn Jung-hwan]], [[Hong Myung-bo]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Sohn Kee-chung]], [[Hwang Young-cho]]). [[Baseball]] players' names are usually changed to Western order; for example Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as [[Chan-ho Park]]. [[Golf]]ers' names are also typically switched to Western order; the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as [[Se-Ri Pak]]. Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Mordvins]] use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example [[Aleksandr Sharonov|Sharonon Sandra]] (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example [[Yovlan Olo]] (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).

Mongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.

==Non-human personal names==
Apart from the [[Linnaean taxonomy]], some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.

===Names of pets===
Pet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC&amp;pg=PA127 The complete idiot's guide to pet psychic communication], Debbie McGillivray, Eve Adamson, Alpha Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59257-214-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-214-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoxbJ_oF7LAC&amp;pg=PA10 Adopting a Pet For Dummies] Page 10, By Eve Adamson&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as [[ontologically]] different from unnamed [[laboratory animal]]s with which they work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a5k7231264jl2j22/ Proper names and the social construction of biography: The negative case of laboratory animals], Mary T. Phillips, Qualitative Sociology, Volume 17, Number 2, SpringerLink&lt;/ref&gt;

The name given to a pet may refer to its appearance&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA1 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 1, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or personality,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA7 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 2, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or be chosen for [[endearment]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA23 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 4, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or in honor of a favorite [[celebrity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/09/28/what-celebrity-would-you-name-your-pet-after/ What celebrity would you name your pet after?], by Margaret Lyons, Sep 28 2009, Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pet owners give human names to their pets. This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA13 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 3, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, [[pet]]s or sporting [[animal]]s are sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, such as the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], give animals nonhuman names because it would be seen as offensive and disrespectful to the person of the same name.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Dolphin names for each other===
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that humans are not the only animals that use personal names. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington studying [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in Sarasota Bay, Florida, found that the dolphins had names for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |title=Dolphins, like humans, recognize names, May 9, 2006,CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602074304/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |archivedate=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dolphin chooses its name as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animals/060508_dolphin_names.html Dolphins Name Themselves], By Bjorn Carey, posted: 8 May 2006, livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Polybiography''' is the use of [[Email archiving|archived internet email services]] such as ListServs and WWWeb to publish historical information by those involved in the history. The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles, images, photographs, commentary, and discussion of those items in a process called a "polybiography"... the history by many of the many events.  The site is designed to be a [[Digital library#Searching|searchable repository]] of "raw material" for those with an interest in the history of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]] ([[ultrasonography]]).

This Internet based [[archive|historical archive]] has been referred to as a "polybiography" because it is both [[biographical]] and [[autobiographical]]; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed. The resulting [[archive]] is expected to be similar to an [[oral history]] where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative. However, the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited. The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are [[self-selected]]. The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history. The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals' writing styles, and a possibly confused organization.

The polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet. Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events. By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history. This will allow those who were assistants to contribute, as well as the luminaries; where as with the traditional oral history, the editor might not locate some relatively minor, relocated participants.

The concept of the "polybiography" was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History &amp; Computing in [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, COMMUNITY, AND VALUES, http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/04/dubose.php, accessed November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DuBose TJ; "A Poly-Autobiography of Sonography"; Proceedings [[American Association of History &amp; Computing]], Waco, Texas April 13–15, 2000. http://www.theaahc.org/, last access: February 21, 2001 http://www.theaahc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The original article was titled "Poly-autobiography of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]]",&lt;ref&gt;SDMS &amp; OBGYN.net; Ultrasound-History Forum &amp; Archives: http://forums.obgyn.net/ultrasound-history/; last access: February 21, 2001
&lt;/ref&gt; but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that, while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb, the term "polybiography" would be more appropriate, more descriptive, and simpler.

A '''real-name system''' is a system in which when a user who wants to register an account on a [[blog]], website or [[bulletin board system]], is required to offer [[Identity document|identification credentials]] including their legal name to the network service centre. One may use an on-line [[pseudonym]], however, the person's real identity would be available if rules or laws are broken.

==Practice==

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] is the first country to put the real-name system into practice. Since June 28, 2009, thirty-five Korean websites have implemented a name-registration system pursuant to the newly amended Information and Communications Network Act of Korea. It was enacted after the suicide of [[Choi Jin-sil]] which was said to be related to malicious comments about her on Internet bulletin boards. The new rule is aimed at minimizing the amount of negative information to make [[netizen]]s responsible for their behavior on the [[Internet]].

South Koreans have been familiar with the real-name system. Since the mid-1990s, doing real property transactions and financial transactions must be performed under a real name following relevant laws. The real-name system in real property transactions and financial transactions is believed to contribute to the sound economic order of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system real name system] in Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2012, however, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] ruled unanimously that the real-name requirements imposed on big portal service providers by a relevant law&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system Korean Legal Information Institute] for further information of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; is unconstitutional, citing such provision's violation of freedom of speech in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, "[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/08/117_118115.html Online real-name system unconstitutional]", August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the so-called "Choi Jin-sil Law", under the deceased celebrity's name, is to be discarded. Until then, websites with more than 100 thousand visitors per day required users to authenticate their identities by entering their ID numbers when they used portals or other sites.

The Constitutional Court said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public. Despite the enforcement of the system, the number of illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased. Instead, users moved to foreign Websites and the system became discriminatory against domestic operators. It also prevented foreigners who didn’t have a resident registration number here from expressing their opinions online.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Court Decision 2010Hun-Ma47 delivered on August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Yonhap News Agency]], the public voice started to agree on the abolishment of a name-registration system because of the severe problem caused by information leakage. Now the official response from the administration is that they will supplement the certain regulations of personal information on the Internet.

===China===

The Chinese government stated in December 2011 that microblogging sites should make sure users are registered with their real names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China moves to tame microbloggers amid censorship claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-microblogging/china-moves-to-tame-microbloggers-amid-censorship-claims-idUSBRE84S03T20120529|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of Regulations on the Development and Management of microblogging, Beijing in December 2011, the major microblogging sites like Sina, 163 and Sohu all put real name system into practice in 16 March 2012. The users in Beijing who hadn't provided their real information would be barred from posting and transmitting messages after 16 March 2012.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{update inline|date=November 2018}}
&lt;!--describe more precisely with the history and nature of real name system in China--&gt;

==History==
The introduction to real names in modern society originated from state regulations. State governments, in order to monitor and keep track of its citizens, provided citizens with surnames. This allowed them to track property ownership and inheritance, collect taxes, maintain court records, perform police work, conscript soldiers, and control epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James. (1998). Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking sites==

===Facebook===
{{see also|Facebook real-name policy controversy}}
Though the  [[Facebook]] [[social networking site]] does not directly employ the real-name system, the site's online Name Policy indicates the following:
"Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/help/292517374180078|title=Facebook's Name Policy - Facebook Help Center - Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that under Facebook's Name Policy, users are strongly encouraged to provide their real names when creating an account on Facebook. This, according to Facebook, ensures that its users remain safe by knowing who they are connecting and communicating with at all times.

Facebook was first launched at [[Harvard]], where the new social networking site provided a safe, intimate alternative to the other popular social networking sites. According to [[danah boyd]], a social media scholar, "people provided their name because they saw the site as an extension of campus life." Because of this, new users adopted the norms and practices of the early adopters and began to also see Facebook as a secure and private site. Through this early adoption, today, Facebook's astronomical value stems from the quality and quantity of information it has about its users. The social networking site has become an identity service by creating a value proposition based on social norms in which users would naturally share their real names instead of feeling forced to.&lt;ref name="real names"&gt;boyd, danah (2012). "The Politics of 'Real Names': Power, Context, and Control in Networked  Publics." Communications of the ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though requiring users to provide their real names such as the ones listed on credit cards, driver's licenses, and student IDs ensures safety for users, using real names could also be harmful. Emil Protalinski, technology journalist for The Next Web, states how many "Facebook users opt to use [[pseudonyms]] to hide from stalkers, abusive exes, and even governments that don't condone free speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/09/21/facebook-now-wants-snitch-friends-arent-using-real-name/|title=Facebook tests prompt asking you to snitch on your friends who aren't using their real name|first=Emil|last=Protalinski|date=2012-09-21|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these specific users, using pseudonyms allows for them to still be able to connect with colleagues, friends, and family without having to entirely worry about their safety had they provided Facebook with their real names that others could find more easily. This brings up the issues of privacy for Facebook users. "People feel as though their privacy has been violated when their agency has been undermined or when information about a particular social context has been obscured in ways that subvert people's ability to make an informed decision about what to reveal."&lt;ref name="real names"/&gt; Some users may feel uncomfortable with the knowledge that their real names would be publicly displayed and choose, instead, to use a fake name that appears real to Facebook under its Name Policy.

===Twitter===
[[File:Twitter name looks great.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Twitter registration page saying "Name looks great" after a made-up, meaningless, and unformatted name is entered.]]
Unlike Facebook, the [[Twitter]] social networking site does not require users to enter real names when creating Twitter accounts, and the site is entirely void of the real-name system. According to Twitter's former [[CEO]], [[Dick Costolo]], the social networking site does not care what a user's real name is as long as the site connects users to the information that they care about. Whether the information comes from an account with a real name or one using a pseudonym does not matter. 
Yet, Costolo also points out that Twitter is not necessarily in full support of the idea of users having pseudonyms; instead, Twitter is simply "wedded to people being able to use the service as they see fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/09/16/why-twitter-doesnt-care-what-your-real-name-is/|title=Why Twitter doesn’t care what your real name is|date=2011-09-16|work=Gigaom.com|first=Mathew|last=Ingram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter emphasizes care in its services that it provides for users rather than requiring real names. This does not mean, however, that Twitter ignores the issue regarding real identities. Regarding this matter, Twitter is able to verify accounts of prominent Twitter users such as celebrities in order to ensure identity fraud is not being committed on the social networking site.

==In fiction==
[[Vernor Vinge]]'s novella ''[[True Names]]'' charts the idea of how serious knowing one's identity can be. As such it is also a part of [[cypherpunk]] culture.

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8913">[[Image:Sanjūrokkasen-gaku - 8 - Kanō Tan’yū - Sōjō Henjō.jpg|thumb|''Sōjō [[Henjō]]'' by [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 1648]]The {{nihongo|'''Rokkasen'''|六歌仙||"six poetry immortals"}} are six [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poets]] of the mid-ninth century who were named by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] in the ''[[kana]]'' and ''[[Kanji|mana]]'' prefaces to the [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|poetry anthology]] ''[[Kokin Wakashū|Kokin wakashū]]'' (c. 905–14) as notable poets of the generation before its compilers.

== History of the term ==
In their original appearance in the prefaces of the ''Kokin wakashū'', the six ''rokkasen'' are not actually referred to with this term.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous phrases that show the conceptualization of these six as a cohesive group, but the term "Rokkasen" first appeared in an early Kamakura-period commentary on ''Kokin wakashū'', titled ''Sanryūshō'' 三流抄.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1986|title=Rokkasen|encyclopedia=Waka Daijiten|publisher=Meiji Sho-in|last=Masuda|first=Shigeo|date=|page=1083|language=ja|editor1-last=Inukai|editor1-first=Kiyoshi|editor2-last=Inoue|editor2-first=Muneo|editor3-last=Ohkubo|editor3-first=Tadashi|editor4-last=Ono|editor4-first=Hiroshi|editor5-last=Tanaka|editor5-first=Yutaka|editor6-last=Hashimoto|editor6-first=Fumio|editor7-last=Fujihira|editor7-first=Haruo|trans-title=The Six Poetry Immortals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The members of the ''rokkasen'', and their total poems in ''Kokin wakashū,'' are as follows:
*[[Ōtomo no Kuronushi]], 3 poems
*[[Ono no Komachi]], 18 poems
*[[Ariwara no Narihira]], 30 poems
*[[Kisen Hōshi]], 1 poem
*[[Henjō|Sōjō Henjō]], 17 poems
*[[Fun'ya no Yasuhide]], 1 poem

== Tsurayuki's Criticism ==
In his prefaces to the anthology ''Kokin wanashū'', Ki no Tsurayuki first praises two poets, [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] and [[Yamabe no Akahito]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; from the period before the ''rokkasen'' and then praises these six poets of the generation preceding his own, but also critiques what he considers to be weaknesses in their personal styles.

His criticism in both prefaces is as follows:

''Kana preface''

::Among well-known recent poets, Archbishop Henjō masters style but is deficient in substance. It is no more satisfying to read one of his poems than to fall in love with a woman in a picture. The poetry of Ariwara Narihira tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower with a lingering fragrance. Fun'ya no Yasuhide's language is skillful, but his style is inappropriate to his content. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy costumes. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is veiled, leaving us uncertain about his meaning. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Since not many of his poems are known, we cannot study them as a group in order to evaluate him. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same line as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is moving and lacking in strength. It reminds us of a beautiful woman suffering from an illness. Its weakness is probably due to her sex. The style of Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems is crude. They are like a mountain peasant resting under a flowering tree with a load of firewood on his back.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=7|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mana preface''

::The Kazan Archbishop [Henjō] masters style, but his flowery language bears little fruit. His poems, like a picture of a beautiful woman, move our hearts without leading to anything. The poetry of the Ariwara Middle Captain [Narihira] tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower that retains its fragrance. Bunrin [Fun'ya no Yasuhide] deals cleverly with topics, but his style approaches vulgarity. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy dress. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is dazzling, but his poems do not flow smoothly. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same like as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is beautiful but weak, like an ailing woman wearing cosmetics. Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems belong to the line of Sarumaru of old. Although his poetry has a certain light, witty interest, the style is extremely crude, as though a peasant were resting in front of a flowering tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=257–8|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying theories on both why Tsurayuki chose these six poets and why he chose to criticize them in this manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Helen Craig McCullough|Helen McCullough]] claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brocade by Night: 'Kokin Wakashū' and the Court Style in Japanese Classical Poetry|last=McCullough|first=Helen Craig|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8047-1246-8|location=Stanford, CA|pages=313–4|translator-last=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (''kokoro'' 心) and words (''kotoba'' 言葉).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncovering Heian Japan: An Archaeology of Sensation and Inscription|last=Lamarre|first=Thomas|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780822380467|location=Durham, NC|pages=166–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The concept of the ''rokkasen'' had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods.

In 1009–1011, [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] compiled an expanded list known as the [[Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan Encyclopedia|last=Frédéric|first=Louis|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=0674007700|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=818}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the "Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry," and the "Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry."

Many Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of ''waka'' poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the ''waka'' anthologies ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' and ''Kokin wakashū''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46–54 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the ''waka'' poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (六歌仙時代 ''rokkasen jidai''), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of [[Emperor Kōkō|Emepror Kōkō]], but disagree on whether it begins with [[Emperor Ninmyō]] or [[Emperor Montoku]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shimada |first=Ryōji |date=February 1970 |title=Rokkasen jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40001325603 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=42 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ryōji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmyō is the better choice for the start of this periodization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, Ōtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu|Hyakunin isshū]]''.

The '''''Schindlerjuden''''', literally translated from [[German language|German]] as "'''Schindler's Jews'''", were a group of roughly 1,200 [[Jews]] who were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]] during [[the Holocaust]]. They survived the years of the Nazi regime primarily through the intervention of Schindler, who found them protected status as industrial workers at his [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|enamelware factory]] in [[Kraków]] and, after 1944, in an [[Brünnlitz labor camp|armaments factory]] in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|occupied Czechoslovakia]]. There, they avoided being sent to [[Extermination camp|death camps]] and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the ''Schindlerjuden''.

Their story has been depicted in the book ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', by [[Thomas Keneally]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the survivors, persuaded Thomas Keneally to write the novel and Steven Spielberg to produce the film.

In 2012, there were estimated to be over 8,500 descendants of ''Schindlerjuden'' living across the [[United States]], Europe, and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2012/mar/28/survivor-of-the-holocaust-tells-how-schindler/|title=Survivor of the Holocaust tells how Schindler saved her life|last=Smith|first=Larry|date=28 March 2012|work=Tribune 242|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The List==
The original list of ''Schindlerjuden'' who were transported to [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Schindler's Brünnlitz factory]] in [[Brněnec]], [[Sudetenland|occupied Czechoslovakia]], was prepared by [[Mietek Pemper]], [[Itzhak Stern]] and Oskar Schindler during September and October of 1944.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Mietek Pemper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjJNDD9m?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date={{date|2011-6-11|mdy}} |archivedate=2012-10-27 |accessdate={{date|2012-10-27|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Oskar Schindler's collaborator, Mietek Pemper, has died |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Oskar+Schindler+collaborator+dies/4919305/story.html |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Mietek Pemper, 91, Camp Inmate Who Compiled Schindler's List |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621040823/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html?_r=1 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=18 June 2011 |archivedate=2011-06-21 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That list likely no longer exists.

Another list with 1,000 names, compiled by Pemper upon the prisoners' arrival 21 October 1944 at Schindler's [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Brünnlitz factory]], was presented by him to the [[International Tracing Service]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html#c2713 Sample Documents from the ITS Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721233447/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html |date=2011-07-21}}, [[International Tracing Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lists of 1,098 prisoners made by camp administration in Brünnlitz on 18 April 1945 are extant, and are preserved in [[Yad Vashem]] Memorial, where Oskar and [[Emilie Schindler]] are recognized among [[Righteous Among the Nations|the Righteous]].&lt;ref name="Righteous"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/schindler|title=Oskar and Emilie Schindler {{!}} www.yadvashem.org|website=www.yadvashem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oskarschindler.com/list.htm|title=Schindler's entire List|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oskarschindler.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first list contains 297 female prisoners while the second list contains 801 male prisoners. There are several preserved copies and carbon copies of the list from April 1945, with some in museums while others are in private hands, mostly of families of former prisoners. In April 2009, a carbon copy of the original list, documenting 801 names, was discovered among the documentation ''Schindler's Ark'' author Thomas Keneally had donated to the [[State Library of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/04/08/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n2esp|title=Hallan la lista de Schindler|author=Reuters|first=|date=8 April 2009|website=|publisher=[[La Jornada]]|language=es|trans-title=Finding Schindler's List|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.

# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

He sought out Paul when everyone else was afraid of him, bringing him to the apostles.  It was Barnabas whom the apostles first sent to [[Antioch]] with Paul. Their long association was broken only when Barnabas was determined to take his cousin Mark, whom Paul did not trust just then, on a missionary journey. The three were later reconciled.

'''Stefano Colonna''' was the name of several members of the Italian family of [[Colonna family|Colonna]]. The most important include:

*'''Stefano Colonna the Elder''' (1265 &amp;ndash; c. 1348) was son of [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1293)|Giovanni Colonna]] and one of the most important political figures in Rome in the first half of the 14th century. He was heir of the [[Papal States|Papal]] fief of [[Palestrina]]. In 1290 he was named count of [[Romagna]], and he was several times Senator of [[History of Rome#Medieval Rome|Rome]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] vicar in [[Italy]]. A staunch [[Ghibelline]], he struggled for large part of his life against the Guelph [[Orsini]] family. He was a protector of [[Petrarch]], who dedicated two sonnets and other works to him. He was also a fierce opponent of [[Cola di Rienzo]], leader of the popular rebellion of Rome in 1347. He was brother to [[Sciarra Colonna]].
*'''Stefano Colonna the Younger''' (died 1347), son of the former, was Senator of Rome in 1306 and 1330. He was killed (together with his sons Giovanni and Camillo) at the [[battle of Porta San Lorenzo]] (1347) against the troops of Cola di Rienzo.
*'''Stefanello''' (died c. 1368), son of the former, was the first of the Palestrina branch of the family.
*'''Stefano Colonna di [[Palestrina]]''' (16th century). Commander of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] militia during the siege of Florence.&lt;ref name=af&gt;{{cite web|title=L'assedio di Firenze:cronologia|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/aa1528a.htm|website=cronologia.leonardo.it|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Martyrs==
* '''[[José Dizon|Jose M. Dizon]]''' -  was a Filipino patriot who was among those who founded the [[Katipunan]] that sparked the [[Philippine Revolution]]. Dizon was born in [[Binondo, Manila]]. In April 1892, he was inducted into the freemasonic lodge founded by Pedro Serrano Laktaw. That same year, he founded the lodge Taliba in Trozo, Manila and served as its venerable master. He was also among the officers of the grand regional council that included [[Apolinario Mabini]].
* '''Domingo Franco''' - Born in [[Mambusao, Capiz]], Franco was the third among the six children of Juan Franco and Ciriaca Tuason. His father worked as procurador judicial, or solicitor, in the local justice of the peace court. He kept in his care the documents of the [[La Liga Filipina]] as ordered by [[José Rizal|Jose Rizal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/wv/page3.html|title=WESTERN VISAYAS, Philippines Unsung Heroes|website=www.msc.edu.ph|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeriano Adriano''' - A reformist, Adriano was one of those executed by the Spaniards soon after the revolution in 1896 broke out. He was the eldest of the seven children of Pioquinto Adriano and Agapita Resurreccion of Beata, [[Pandacan, Manila]]. Adriano enrolled in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], but it is not known whether he finished a degree. For twenty years, he worked in the third branch of the Court of the First Instance as clerk of court.
* '''Moises Salvador''' - was a contractor, mason, and propagandist. Salvador was born in San Sebastian which was formerly a part of [[Quiapo, Manila]]. He was the son of Ambrosio Salvador, founding president of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and Acosta Francisco.
* '''Faustino Villaruel''' - a merchant from [[Pandacan, Manila]]. A mason and one of the founding member of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and supporter of the propaganda movement.
* '''Francisco L. Roxas''' - was a businessman, musician and a second cousin of one of the richest men in the [[Philippines]] at that time, Don Pedro Pablo Roxas. He was born in [[Binondo, Manila]].
* '''Luis Enciso Villareal''' - was a member of the Propaganda Movement. Villareal was born in [[Daraga, Albay]]. His father, Francisco Villareal, was known to be a “wonderful fiddler” and a graceful dancer. Meanwhile, his mother was Maria Espinas. His parents own an abaca plantation. He was initially enrolled in the town school but was later sent to a seminary in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] where he finished with a bachelor of arts degree.
* '''Geronimo M. Cristobal''' - He was an infantry corporal in the regiment known by the nickname “Burgos.” As he stood there facing the array of guns pointed menacingly at him and his companions, he must have thought it rather unreal that he should meet his fate at the hand of his former comrades-in-arms, some of whom could be his friends.
* '''Antonio Salazar''' - Salazar y San Agustin was one of the 13 Masons and revolutionaries who were executed by the Spanish authorities.
* '''Ramon Padilla''' - Padilla at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution in 1896 was said to be a clerk at the Comandancia de la Marina (Navy).
* '''Braulio Rivera''' - Born in Gitna (now renamed after him), [[Tondo, Manila]] near the corner of Zabala and Sto. Cristo Streets. Rivera was the son of Jose Rivera, a worker at the tobacco monopoly administration. Little is known of his early background: although only an elementary graduate, he was employed as a clerk at the “Sub-inspeccion General de Montes”. He was blessed with an exceptional singing voice thus, was inclined to singing. He was also an able musician who played three instruments - the guitar, violin and flute.
* '''Faustino Mañalac''' - He was a clerk in the Port of Manila administration and headed the Ilog Pasig council of the KKK in Binondo. A son of a carpenter at the naval shipyard in San Roque, Cavite, he became a member of the KKK Supreme Council using the alias "Mayon". Married to Marta Saldaña, who was a member of the KKK women's section along with Gregoria de Jesus, Maria Dizon, Josefa and Trinidad Rizal, Mañalac is listed among those who visited the Pamitinan caves with [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]], [[Aurelio Tolentino]], Guillermo Masangkay on Good Friday, 1895 and wrote about Philippine independence on the walls of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16656/16656-h/16656-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&amp;id=16yXRtEdRI5NtFkXamjeQJpRX8i6NUsLsBUUEgy3hTC4&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Benedicto P. Nijiga''' - During a raid of a printing press in Binondo, the Spaniards found and confiscated subversive documents including a list of members of the Katipunan. Benedicto Nijaga was on the list as a collector of revolutionary funds. Upon the order of Gov. Polavieja to arbitrarily arrest all suspected members of the Katipunan, Nijaga was arrested while he was campaigning for revolutionary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calbayogko.tripod.com/id1.html|title=History|website=calbayogko.tripod.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''traitorous eight''' was a group of eight employees who left [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] in 1957 to found [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. [[William Shockley]] had in 1956 recruited a group of young PhD graduates with the goal to develop and produce new semiconductor devices. While Shockley had received a [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics and was an experienced researcher and teacher, his management of the group was authoritarian and unpopular.&lt;ref group=note name=NESP/&gt; This was accentuated by the fact that Shockley's research focus wasn’t proving fruitful.&lt;ref group=note name=PARA/&gt; After the demand for Shockley to be replaced was rebuffed, the eight left to form their own company.  

Shockley described their leaving as a "betrayal". The eight who left Shockley Semiconductor were [[Julius Blank]], [[Victor Grinich]], [[Jean Hoerni]], [[Eugene Kleiner]], [[Jay Last]], [[Gordon Moore]], [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Sheldon Roberts]]. In August 1957 they reached an agreement with [[Sherman Fairchild]] and on September 18, 1957, they formed [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The newly founded Fairchild Semiconductor soon grew into a leader of the semiconductor industry. In 1960 it became an incubator of [[Silicon Valley]] and was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations including [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; These many spin-off companies came to be known as "[[#Fairchildren|Fairchildren]]".

==Initiation==
[[File:William Shockley, Stanford University.jpg|thumb|200px|Shockley in 1975]]

In the winter of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an inventor of the transistor and a visiting professor at [[Stanford University]], decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and [[Shockley diode]]s.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=67}} He found a sponsor in [[Raytheon]], but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=69}} In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier [[Arnold Beckman]], the owner of [[Beckman Instruments]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=164–165}} Shockley needed one million dollars.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=69}} Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did not want to give them to his competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=68, 86: For example, the field-effect transistor with a p-n junction proposed by Shockley ideally suited for DC modulators was produced by Beckman Instruments.}} Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=68}}

The new department of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years).{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=68, 73}} During 1955 Beckman and Shockley signed the deal,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=168}} bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000,{{sfn |Lojek|2007 |pp=81–82: Shockley had access to all developments of Bell; he obtained licenses on the newest technologies involving lithographic photoresist and silicon oxide passivation.}} and selected the location in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], near [[Palo Alto, California]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=68}} The place did not prove very successful: Shockley's colleagues at [[Bell Labs]] and [[RCA]] refused to move to a rural location with no long-distance phone service.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=69–70: a long-distance line has since been brought to Palo Alto, in 1957}} The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted ads in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=70–71}} Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of [[Dow Chemical]], Robert Noyce of [[Philco]] and [[Jay Last]], a former intern of Beckman Instruments.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=141: Last turned down an offer from Beckman Instruments in favor of Shockley Labs.}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=71–73}} The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison,{{sfn|Lécuyer|2000|p=241: Allison left Shockley for Fairchild after the traitorous eight, and later founded [[Signetics]]}} Shockley himself recruited at a meeting of the American Physical Society.

Selection continued throughout 1956. Shockley was a proponent of social technologies (which later led him to [[eugenics]]) and asked each candidate to pass a psychological test,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=170: The consultants found Shockley, Noyce and Moore "very bright, but they would never make good managers"}} followed by an interview.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=164–165}}

Blank, Last, Moore, Noyce and Roberts started working in April–May, and Kleiner, Grinich and Hoerni came during the summer.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=74}} By September 1956, the lab had 32 employees, including Shockley.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Each successful candidate had to negotiate his salary with Shockley. Kleiner, Noyce and Roberts settled for $1,000 per month; the less-experienced Last got $675. Hoerni did not bother about his payment.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Shockley set his own salary at $2,500 and made all salaries accessible to all employees.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=74}} Two of Shockley's choices later appeared to be mistakes: William Happ was proven insufficiently competent for the work,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}} and technologist [[Dean Knapic]] had forged his university degree and certificate of military service. He later brought Shockley's technologies to competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}}{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=45, 69}}

The members of the future traitorous eight were aged between 26 (Last) and 33 (Kleiner); six of them held a PhD.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=9}} Hoerni was an experienced scientist and gifted manager, and, according to [[Bo Lojek]], matched Shockley in intellect.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=125}}{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=276}} Only Noyce was involved in semiconductor research,{{sfn|Lécuyer|2000|p=160}} and only Grinich had experience in electronics.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=56}}

==Research strategy==
Throughout 1956 most members of the lab were assembling and tuning the equipment, and "pure scientists" Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|pp=86–87}} After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning Shockley diodes for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a field effect transistor for Beckman Instruments.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=79, 80}} Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake. Because the work on Shockley diodes took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}}

According to Noyce and Moore, as well as David Brock and [[Joel Shurkin]], the shift from bipolar transistors to Shockley diodes was unexpected.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=80}}{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=12}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}} Shockley initially planned to work on the mass production of diffusion bipolar transistors, but then set up a "secret project" on Shockley diodes, and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors.{{sfn|Holbrook|2003|p=54}}&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Gordon (2001) ''[http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/conferences/silicon_papers/moore.pdf Learning the Silicon Valley Way]''. stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this turn are unknown.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}} According to Beckman's biographer, Shockley regarded his diode as an interesting scientific problem, and chose it, neglecting Beckman's commercial interests.{{sfn|Thackray|2000|p=245}}

Bo Lojek, based on the archives of Shockley, believes that Shockley Labs never worked on bipolar transistors; that Shockley diodes were Shockley and Beckman's original target, for which Beckman Instruments received military R&amp;D contracts;{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=79–81}} and that Shockley diodes could have found widespread use in telephony if Shockley had improved their reliability.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=80–81}}

==Frictions==
&lt;!--[[File:Отмечают Нобелевскую Шокли 2 ноября 1956.jpg|thumb|Staff of Shockley Labs celebrate the announcement of the Shockley's Nobel Prize award on November 2, 1956. Sitting, left to right: Moore, Roberts, Jones, Shockley. Standing: Noyce (center, dark suit), Last (far right).]] --&gt;
Historians and colleagues generally agree that Shockley was a poor manager and businessman.&lt;ref group=note name=NESP/&gt; From early childhood he was prone to outbursts of unprovoked aggression,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=9–11}} which were suppressed due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He also tended to see rivals, even in his own subordinates.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=175}}

On November 1, 1956, it was announced that the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=76}} The related public events of November–December overtired Shockley and took him away from the lab in a time when it had several management problems. Despite the festivities, the atmosphere in the lab was unhealthy.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=76–80}}

Although Shockley was never diagnosed by psychiatrists,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=77: "Shockley's autism was unavoidable and was a reason for many of Shockley's social confrontations"}} historians characterized Shockley's state of mind in 1956–1957 as paranoia&lt;ref group=note name=PARA/&gt; or [[autism]]. All phone calls were recorded,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=232}} and the staff was not allowed to share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=175–176}} Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=174}} At some point he sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=45}}&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

The team started losing its members, starting with Jones, a technologist, who left in January 1957 due to a conflict with Grinich and Hoerni. Noyce and Moore then stood on different sides: Moore led the dissidents, whereas Noyce stood behind Shockley and tried to resolve conflicts.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}} Shockley appreciated that and considered Noyce as his sole support in the group.{{sfn|Berlin|2001}}

==Resignation==
[[File:Gordon Moore.jpg|thumb|left|Gordon Moore in 2004]]

In March 1957, Kleiner, who was beyond Shockley's suspicions, asked permission ostensibly to visit an exhibition in Los Angeles. Instead he flew to New York to seek investors for a new company, and his parents, New York residents, assisted him.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}} Kleiner was supported by Blank, Grinich, Last, Roberts, Hoerni and Moore.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=49}} [[Arthur Rock]] and Alfred Coyle from [[Hayden, Stone &amp; Co.]] became interested in the offer, believing that trainees of a Nobel laureate were destined to succeed.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}}

As a last resort, on May 29, 1957 a group led by Moore presented Arnold Beckman with an ultimatum: solve the "Shockley problem" or they would leave. Moore suggested finding a professor position for Shockley and replacing him in the lab with a professional manager.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=177}} Beckman refused, believing that Shockley could still improve the situation, later regretting this decision.{{sfn|Thackray|2000|loc=p. 249: "I didn't know enough about Shockley at the time when this group came up to me and said it's either Shockley or us. If I had known what I know now, I'd have said good-bye to Shockley and I probably would have been very much involved in the semiconductor business. But I didn't. We carried on for a while, and finally it got to the point where we could see that [Shockley] was just incapable of running an operation".}}

&lt;!--[[File:Учредительный доллар Fairchild Semiconductor.png|thumb|One of the ten one-dollar bills signed by the founding members of Fairchild Semiconductor, from the Stanford University collection.]]--&gt;
In June 1957, Beckman finally put a manager between Shockley and the team, but by then seven key employees had already made their decision.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}} At the last minute they were joined by Noyce. Roberts persuaded him to attend the meeting of the "California group", as they called themselves in the agreement with Fairchild.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=103}} The meeting was held at the [[Clift (hotel)|Clift Hotel]] in California and was attended by Rock and Coyle.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} These ten people became the core of a new company.

{{quote|Coyle, a ruddy-faced Irishman with a fondness for ceremony, pulled out 10 newly minted $1 bills and laid them carefully on the table. "Each of us should sign every bill", he said. These dollar bills, covered with signatures, he explained, would be their contracts with each other.&lt;ref name=SFG/&gt;}}

Finding investors proved to be difficult.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} The US electronics industry was concentrated in the east, and the California group preferred to stay near Palo Alto.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=49}} In August 1957, Rock and Coyle met with the inventor and businessman Sherman Fairchild, founder of [[Fairchild Aircraft]] and [[Fairchild Camera]].&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;{{sfn|Thackray|2015|pp=164-165}}  Fairchild sent Rock to his deputy, Richard Hodgson. Hodgson, risking his reputation, accepted the offer and within a few weeks completed all paperwork.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=89, Hodgson: "I hope to hell you guys know what you're doing. Because if you don't, I'm losing my job"}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} The capital of the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, was divided into 1,325 shares. Each member of the traitorous eight received 100 shares, 225 shares went to Hayden, Stone &amp; Co and 300 shares remained in reserve. Fairchild provided a loan of $1.38 million.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=88}} To secure the loan, the traitorous eight gave Fairchild the voting rights on their shares, with the right to buy their shares at a fixed total price of $3 million.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=89}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=182}}

On September 18, 1957, Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Moore, Noyce, Roberts and Hoerni resigned from Shockley Labs.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} They became known as the "traitorous eight", though it is not known who coined the term.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=181}} Shockley could never understand the reasons for this defection.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=92}} After that time, he never talked to Noyce again,{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=88}} but continued to follow the work of "The Eight".{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=87}} He also combed through all records left by The Eight, basing patents, held as Shockley Labs' intellectual property, on any important ideas.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=87}} (Technically, in accordance with U.S. law, those patents were issued to the respective inventing employees.)

In 1960, with the help of a new team,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=101}} Shockley brought his own diode to serial production, but time had been lost, and competitors had already come close to the development of integrated circuits.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=88}}{{sfn|Thackray|2000|p=249}} Beckman sold the unprofitable Shockley Labs to investors from Cleveland. On July 23, 1961, Shockley was seriously injured in a car crash,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=188}} and after recovery left the company and returned to teaching at Stanford.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=97}} In 1969,{{sfn|Coller|2009|p=174}} [[IT&amp;T]], the new owners of Shockley Labs moved the company to Florida. When the staff refused to move, the lab ceased to exist.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=187}}

==Split==
[[File:Fairchild Bldg.jpg|thumb|The first building of Fairchild Semiconductor, at 844 East Charleston Road, [[Palo Alto, California]]]]

{{quote|We were all focused on the single goal of producing our first product, a double diffused silicon mesa transistor ... We were all very young (27 to 32), only a few years beyond our school days. We were a very compatible group, and spent a lot of time outside our working hours. Most of the founders were married, busy starting their families and raising small children in addition to all the time and effort they were spending building Fairchild ... I am struck by what a remarkable time it was and what innovative opportunities. – ''Jay T. Last, 2010''{{sfn|Last|2010|pp=vii–viii}} }}

In November 1957, The Eight moved out of Grinich's garage{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=106}} into a new, empty building on the border of Palo Alto and Mountain View.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=54–55}} Their starting salaries ranged from $13,800 to $15,600 per year.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=88}} Hodgson, who headed the board of directors, suggested Noyce as the operational manager of the company, but Noyce refused.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|pp=89–90}} Fairchild, knowing Noyce's personality, also opposed his leadership.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=146, 161}} Regardless of the will of Fairchild, Noyce and Moore, who were responsible for the research and production, respectively, became the "leaders among equals".{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=183}}

The group immediately set a clear goal to produce an array of silicon diffusion mesa transistors for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=56}} Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=113}} The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}} The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=24, 27}} This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}} However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}}

In 1958, Fairchild mesa transistors were considered for the [[D-17B]] [[Minuteman I]] guidance computer, but they did not meet military standards of reliability.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=108}} Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=121–122}} The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=123}} Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=126}} However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=125}}

In 1959, Sherman Fairchild exercised his right to purchase shares of the members of the traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt; In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last's project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce declined to discuss the matter.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=133, 138}} This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961 Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head [[Amelco]], the microelectronics branch of [[Teledyne]]. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.

[[File:IC Plaque.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The historic marker at the Fairchild building at which the "traitorous eight" set up shop and the first commercially practical integrated circuit was invented]]

In 1960–1965 Fairchild was the undisputed leader of the semiconductor market, both technologically and in terms of sales. {{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=157–159}} Early 1965 brought the first signs of management problems.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=158}} In November 1965, the creators of integrated operational amplifiers [[Bob Widlar]] and David Talbert left for [[National Semiconductor]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=282–283}} In February 1967, they were followed by five top managers who disagreed with Noyce.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=159}} Noyce started litigation with shareholders and effectively removed himself from the operational management.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=158}} In July 1967, the company became unprofitable and lost their leading position in the market to Texas Instruments.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=159}}

In March 1968, Moore and Noyce decided to leave Fairchild and again, as nine years prior, turned to Arthur Rock. In the summer of 1968, they founded [[Intel#Origins|NM Electronics]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=162}} Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Hoerni and Roberts, set aside the past disagreements and financially supported the company of Moore and Noyce.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=184}} A year later, N-M Electronics bought the trade name rights from the hotel chain Intelco and took the name of [[Intel]]. Moore held senior positions at Intel until 1997, when he was named Chairman Emeritus of Intel Corporation. Noyce left Intel in 1987 to lead the non-profit consortium [[Sematech]]. He died suddenly in 1990, the first of The Eight.

Grinich left Fairchild in 1968 for a short sabbatical,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=161}} and then taught at [[UC Berkeley]] and [[Stanford]], where he published the first comprehensive textbook on integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to integrated circuits | author = Victor H. Grinich|author2= Horace G. Jackson | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-07-024875-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later co-founded and ran several companies developing industrial [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags.&lt;ref name=G1/&gt;

Blank was the last of The Eight to leave Fairchild, in 1969. He founded the financial firm [[Xicor]] specializing in innovative start-ups, and in 2004 sold it for $529 million.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;

Hoerni headed Amelco until the summer of 1963, and, after the conflict with the Teledyne owners, for three years headed [[Union Carbide Electronics]].{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=263}} In July 1967, supported by the watch company [[Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère]] (the predecessor of [[Swatch Group]]) founded [[Intersil]], the company that created the market for custom CMOS circuits.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=263–264}} The circuits developed by Intersil for [[Seiko]] in 1969–1970 contributed to the rise of Japanese electronic watches.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=277–279}}&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Intersil and Intel weren't competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom CMOS circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=276}}

Last remained with Amelco and for twelve years served as Vice President of Technology at Teledyne. In 1982, he founded Hillcrest Press specializing in art books.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt;&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; After leaving Amelco, Roberts led his own business, and in 1973–1987 served as a trustee of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; Amelco, after numerous mergers, acquisitions and renaming, became a subsidiary of [[Microchip Technology]].

In 1972, Kleiner and Tom Perkins from [[Hewlett-Packard]] founded the venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, which has been involved in the creation and/or funding of Amazon.com, Compaq, Genentech, Intuit, Lotus, Macromedia, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Symantec and dozens of other companies. Kleiner later wrote that his goal was to geographically spread the venture financing.{{sfn|Gupta|2000|p=106}}

==Honors==
In May 2011, the [[California Historical Society]] gave the "Legends of California Award" to The Eight. Blank, Last, Moore, and Roberts' son Dave attended the event in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW01/&gt;

==Fairchildren==
{{redirect|Fairchildren|the 2015 album|Fairchildren (album)|other uses|Fairchild (disambiguation)}}
In research, reporting, and popular lore related to Silicon Valley, the term "Fairchildren" has been used to refer to:

*The [[corporate spin-off]]s created by former employees of Fairchild Semiconductor.{{sfn|Manners|1995|p=111}}{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=224}} This usage was propagated by historian Leslie Berlin through her 2001 review article,&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; PhD thesis,&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; and biography of [[Robert Noyce]].{{sfn|Berlin|2005}}
* The founders of such firms. This is the earliest usage, e.g., in the 1978 [[BBC Horizon|BBC ''Horizon'']] documentary "Now the chips are down",&lt;ref&gt;"Now the chips are down", Horizon, BBC. First broadcast 31st March 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Wolfe's 1983 profile of Noyce&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; or a 5,000-word profile of Silicon Valley in 1999.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;
* Former Fairchild Semiconductor employees, as in a 1988 ''New York Times'' article.&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;
* The original founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, more commonly known as the traitorous eight. This has been used by the [https://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/corgs/fairchild.html PBS website] and a book by Blasi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

One of the first articles to identify Fairchild as the parent of so many spin-offs appeared in ''Innovation Magazine'' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Nilo Lindgren, "The Splintering of the Solid-State Electronics Industry," reprinted in ''Dealing with Technological Change: Selected Essays from Innovation'', New York: Auerbach Publishers, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The spin-off companies, such as AMD, Intel, Intersil and restructured National Semiconductor, were different from those of the east coast and California's electronic companies established in the 1940s and 1950s. "Old Californians" like Beckman and [[Varian Associates]] did not trust [[Wall Street]] and kept control of their companies for decades, whereas the new companies of the 1960s were created for a quick (within 3–5 years) public sale of shares. Their founders built a business strategy based on the expectations of the investment banks.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=264}} Another characteristic of Silicon Valley was the mobility of managers and professionals among companies.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=220}} Partly because of Noyce, Silicon Valley developed a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=225}} People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry. Fairchild "alumni" can be found not only in electronics-related, but also financial and public relations companies.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|pp=220–221}}

[[File:Trauco.jpg|thumb|Artist's representation of the Trauco]]

In the traditional [[Chilota mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], the '''Trauco''' is a humanoid creature of small stature - similar to a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or [[goblin]] - who lives in the deep forests. It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.

== Legend ==
The '''Trauco''' is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of [[Chiloé]], an island in the south of [[Chile]]. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly '''Fiura'''. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency.

Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chiloé fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly.

When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women.

== Media ==

The Trauco appears in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]] where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots.
