'''Agricultural law''', sometimes referred to as '''Ag Law''', deals with such legal issues as [[agricultural infrastructure]], seed, water, [[fertilizer]], [[pesticide]] use, agricultural finance, agricultural labour, [[agricultural marketing]], agricultural [[insurance]], farming rights, [[land tenure]] and tenancy system and law on Agricultural processing and rural industry. With implementation of modern technologies, issues including credit, [[intellectual property]], trade and commerce related to agricultural products are dealt within the sphere of this law.

Simply put, agricultural law is the study of the special laws and regulations that apply to the production and sale of agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Susan|year=2010|title=A Reconsideration of Agricultural Law|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol34/iss3/5/|journal=William &amp; Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review|volume=V. 34, Issue 3|pages=935–963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Agricultural exceptionalism," i.e., the use of legal exceptions to protect the agricultural industry, is pervasive, worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skogstad|first=Grace|year=1998|title=Ideas, Paradigms, and Institutions: Agricultural Exceptionalism in the European Union and the United States|url=|journal=Governance|volume=11|pages=463–468|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American law schools and legal scholars first recognized agricultural law as a discipline in the 1940s when law schools at Yale, Harvard, Texas, and Iowa explored and initiated agricultural law courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannah|first=Harold|year=1946|title=Law and Agriculture|url=|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=32|pages=781–784|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early efforts were short-lived, however, and agricultural law as a distinct discipline did not resurface for three decades.  In 1979, a scholarly journal, The Agricultural Law Journal was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Neil|year=1990|title=The Study of Agricultural Law in the United States|url=|journal=Arkansas Law Review|volume=43|pages=503–515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the American Agricultural Law Association was formed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Susan|year=2005|title=Thoughts on Agricultural Law and the Role of the American Agricultural Law Association|url=|journal=Drake Journal of Agricultural Law|volume=10|pages=2–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an advanced law degree program, the LL.M.

In recent years, agricultural law studies have expanded to incorporate a wider consideration of the impact of agricultural production, including issues of environmental law, sustainability, animal welfare, and food law and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food, Farming, &amp; Sustainability: Readings in Agricultural Law|last=Schneider|first=Susan|publisher=Carolina Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this expanded perspective, in 2009, the LL.M. Program in Agricultural Law at Arkansas changed its name to the LL.M Program in Agricultural and Food Law.

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|date=2014-02-21|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780544363793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''assignment'''&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''cessio''&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term used in the context of the law of [[contract]] and of [[property (law)|property]]. In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the ''assignor'', transfers rights or benefits to another, the ''assignee''.&lt;ref&gt;For the assignment of claim see [http://www.trans-lex.org/917000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a [[waiver]]) or it may be paid for with a contractual [[consideration]] such as money. 

The rights may be vested or contingent,&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|HCA|21|1963|parallelcite=(1963) 109 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 9 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include an [[equitable interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary|publisher=oxford university press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a [[mortgage note]] issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.

A related concept of assignment is [[novation]] wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnf.tlcollect.com/f1/cl/610/8172/TMT%20Newsletter%20August%202010%20v1d.pdf#page=3 |title=Tips and traps in contracting: novation versus assignment |last1=Kallenbach |first1=Paul |last2=Reid |first2=Nicole |publisher=[[MinterEllison]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish [[privity]] (in other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party [[obligor]] and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.

==Liabilities and duties==
Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive more rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.

However, in the United States, there are various laws that limit the liability of the assignee, often to facilitate credit, as assignees are typically lenders.&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability&gt;[http://arnstein.com/attorneypublications/Ropiquet/Assignee.Liability.-.Through.the.Minefield.pdf Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield]. Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include a provision in the [[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. 1641(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and provisions in the [[Consumer Leasing Act]] and the [[Home Ownership Equity Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability/&gt;

In other cases, the contract may be a [[negotiable instrument]] in which the person receiving the instrument may become a [[holder in due course]], which is similar to an assignee except that issues, such as lack of performance, by the assignor may not be a valid defense for the obligor.&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC/&gt; In 2012, the commission reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule]. FTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignment of contract rights==
{{Contract law}}

After the assignment of contractual rights, the assignee will receive all benefits that had accrued to the assignor. For example, if A contracts to sell his car for $100 to B, A may assign the benefits (the right to be paid $100) to C.&lt;ref&gt;In this scenario, Party A is the '''obligee/assignor''', Party B is an '''obligor''', and Party C is the '''assignee'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Party C is ''not'' a ''[[third party beneficiary]]'', because the contract was not made for C's benefit. Assignment takes place after the contract was formed; they may not precede them.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
===When assignment will be permitted===
The [[common law]] favors the freedom of assignment, so an assignment will generally be permitted unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the contract. Where assignment is thus permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract. An assignment cannot have any effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it reduce the possibility of the other party receiving full performance of the same quality. Certain kinds of performance, therefore, ''cannot'' be assigned, because they create a unique relationship between the parties to the contract. For example, the assignment of a legal malpractice claim is void since an assignee would be a stranger to the attorney-client relationship, who was owed no duty by the attorney and would imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.

Torts are not assignable as [[public policy]], and various statutes may prohibit assignment in certain instances.&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; In addition, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists prohibitions in §317(2)(a) based upon the effect to the nonassigning party (obligor),&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; with similar prohibitions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §2-210.&lt;ref name=LexisNexisStudy&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts18.htm Chapter 18: Assignment and Delegation]. LexisNexis study outline.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UCC §2-210 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210 Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise [sic].}}

===Requirements for an effective assignment===
For assignment to be effective, it must occur in the present. No specific language is required to make such an assignment, but the assignor must make some clear statement of intent to assign clearly identified contractual rights to the assignee. A promise to assign in the future has no legal effect. Although this prevents a party from assigning the benefits of a contract that has not yet been made, a [[court of equity]] may enforce such an assignment where an established economic relationship between the assignor and the assignee raised an expectation that the assignee would indeed form the appropriate contract in the future.

A contract may contain a [[non-assignment clause]], which prohibits the assignment of specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee ''knows'' of the non-assignment clause, or if the non-assignment clause specifies that "all assignments are void".

Two other techniques to prevent the assignment of contracts are ''[[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] clauses'' or clauses creating a ''[[condition subsequent]]''. The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.

====Requirement of a writing====
There are certain situations in which the assignment must be in writing.
#Assignment of [[wages]]; additionally, statutes may prohibit this assignment&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt;
#Assignment of any interest in [[real property]]
#Assignment of [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] worth over $5,000

===Delegation===
A parallel concept to assignment is ''[[delegation (law)|delegation]]'', which occurs when one party transfers his ''duties or liabilities'' under a contract to another. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although a non-assignment clause may also bar delegation.

== Remedies ==
[[Legal remedy|Legal remedies]] may be available if the nonassigning party's rights are affected by the assignment.

===Revocability===
Assignments made for consideration are irrevocable, meaning that the assignor permanently gives up the legal right to take back the assignment once it has been made. Donative assignments, on the other hand, are generally revocable, either by the assignor giving notice to the assignee, taking performance directly from the obligor, or making a subsequent assignment of the same right to another. There are some exceptions to the revocability of a donative assignment:
#The assignment can not be revoked if the obligor has already performed
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignee has received a ''token chose'' (''chose'' being derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "thing", as in a chose of action) - a physical object that signifies a right to collect, such as a stock certificate or the passbook to a savings account.
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignor has set forth in writing the assignment of a ''simple chose'' - a contract right embodied in any form of token.
#[[Estoppel]] can prevent the revocation of a donative assignment if the assignee changed their position in reliance on the assignment.

===Breach and defenses===
A cause of action for [[breach of contract|breach]] on the part of the obligor lies with the assignee, who will hold the exclusive right to commence a cause of action for any failure to perform or defective performance. At this stage, because the assignee "stands in the shoes" of the assignor, the obligor can raise any defense to the contract that the obligor could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the obligor can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the obligor had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.

When the assignor makes the assignment, he makes with it an [[implied warranty]] that the right to assign was not subject to defenses. If the contract had a provision that made the assignment ineffective, the assignee could sue the assignor for breach of this implied warranty. Similarly, the assignee could also sue under this theory if the assignor wrongfully revoked the assignment.

===Successive assignments===
Occasionally, an unscrupulous assignor will asof the assignment, and on the timing of the assignments relative to certain other actions.

In a quirk left over from the common law, if the assignment was donative, the ''last assignee'' is the true owner of the rights. However, if the assignment was for consideration, the ''first assignee'' to actually ''collect against the assigned contract'' is the true owner of the rights. Under the modern ''American rule'', now followed in most U.S. jurisdictions, the first assignor with equity (i.e. the first to have paid for the assignment) will have the strongest claim, while remaining assignees may have other remedies.  In some countries, the rights of the respective assignees are determined by the old common law [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].

# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was revocable (because it had not been made irrevocable by any of the means listed above) have no cause of action whatsoever.
# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was made irrevocable can bring an action for the [[tort]] of [[conversion (law)|conversion]], because the assignment was technically their property when it was given to a later assignee.
# Later assignees for consideration have a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty discussed above.

See [[interpleader]].

==Special rules for assignment of certain rights==

===Property rights===
{{Property law}}
{{See also|Rule in Dumpor's Case|Privity of estate}}
[[Real property]] rights can be assigned just as any other contractual right. However, special duties and liabilities attach to transfers of the right to possess property. With an assignment, the assignor transfers the complete remainder of the interest to the assignee. The assignor must not retain any sort of reversionary interest in the right to possess. The assignee's interest must abut the interest of the next person to have the right to possession. If any time or interest is reserved by a tenant assignor then the act is not an assignment, but is instead a sublease.

The liability of the assignee depends upon the contract formed when the assignment takes place. However, in general, the assignee has privity of estate with a lessor. With privity of estate comes the duty on the part of the assignee to perform certain obligations under covenant, e.g. pay rent. Similarly, the lessor retains the obligations to perform on covenants to maintain or repair the land.

If the assignor agrees to continue paying rent to the lessor and subsequently defaults, the lessor can sue both the assignor under the original contract signed with the lessor as well as the assignee because by taking possession of the property interest, the assignee has obliged himself to perform duties under covenant such as the payment of rent.

Unlike a Novation where consent of both the lessor and lesse is required for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the original lessee, an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.

Absent language to the contrary, a tenant may assign their rights to an assignee without the landlord's consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, when there is a clause that the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not withhold consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may withhold consent at Landlord's sole discretion.

===Partnership rights===
A person can also assign their rights to receive the benefits owed to a partner in a [[partnership]]. However, the assignee can ''not'' thereby gain any of the assignor's rights with respect to the operation of the partnership. The assignee may not vote on partnership matters, inspect the partnership books, or take possession of partnership property; rather, the assignee can only be given the right is to collect distributions of income, unless the remaining partners consent to the assignment of a new general partner with operational, management, and financial interests. If the partnership is dissolved, the assignee can also claim the assignor's share of any distribution accompanying the dissolution.

===Intellectual property rights===
{{See also|transfer (patent)}}

Ownership of intellectual property, including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s, may be assigned, but special conditions attach to the assignment of patents and trademarks. In the [[United States]], assignment of a patent is governed by [[statute]], {{USCode|35|261}}.  Patent rights are assignable by an "instrument in writing."  Title in a patent can also be transferred as a result of other financial transactions, such as a [[merger]] or a [[takeover]], or as a result of operation of law, such as in an [[inheritance]] process, or in a [[bankruptcy]].  An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].  Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a subsequent assignee without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.

With respect to a trademark, the owner of the mark may not transfer ownership of the mark without transferring the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] associated with the mark.

Companies sometimes request from employees that they assign all intellectual property they create while under the employment of the company.  This is typically done within an Employment Agreement, but is sometimes done through a specific agreement called Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA).

===Personal injury torts===

The standard rule is that [[personal injury]] [[tort]] causes of action are nonassignable as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]].&lt;ref name=Stark2003&gt;Stark T. (2003). ''Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate'', [http://www.starklegaled.com/downloads/sample-nadcp-3.2.pdf Ch. 3: Assignment and Delegation]. ALM Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pony v. County of Los Angeles'', 433 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  These should be distinguished from final settlements or judgments resulting from lawsuits brought on such causes of action, which may be assignable.

===Legal malpractice===

In the majority of jurisdictions, assignments involving fraud or [[legal malpractice]] causes of action are void as against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cowan Liebowitz &amp; Latman, PC v. Kaplan'', 902 So. 2d 755, 759-760 (Fla. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equitable assignment==
An '''equitable assignment''' is an assignment, or transfer of rights, in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

===General principles===

There are numerous requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' ''clear and unconditional intention to assign''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|39|2007|litigants=Westbourne Grammar School v Sanget Pty |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are fundamental characteristics of a statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must be made in writing and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning future property in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive consideration for the agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt; However, an absolute assignment does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not [[contractual]], but rather a [[property|proprietary right]] to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|39|1978|litigants=Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett |parallelcite=(1978) 21 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 625 at p. 643 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the assignee has an interest in this future property, in the same manner any owner has over property.

In equity, these principles operate to protect both the assignor and the assignee. In ''Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'',&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt;  a taxpayer attempted to assign by [[deed]], to his wife certain moneys which he was eventually going to receive. This included dividends and [[interest]] due on [[loan]]s. The court held the interest and the [[dividend]]s were expectancies or possibilities which could not be assigned without consideration. The court's worry was that assignments without consideration might be used as instruments of fraud, to avoid creditors and tax collection.

===Mere expectancies===

Courts will not enforce a contract to assign an expectancy unless there is a valuable consideration. For example, under a settlement of property the respondent "the son" would have been entitled to an equal portion of properties along with his other siblings which was gained in a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] by his mother. This portion was only his when allocated to him at his mothers discretion. Prior to this allocation being made, the respondent allotted his benefit to [[trustee]]s for a voluntary settlement. He was assigning or purporting to assign something which he might become entitled to in the future, not a [[contingent interest]]. The judgment held it ineffective and elaborated on previous points to state the respondent cannot be compelled to allow the trustees to retain the appointed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Northumberland (Duke) v Inland Revenue Comrs&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1702">In the [[ecclesiastical law]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], the '''Barrier Act''' of 1697 is a measure which compels the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] to consult the wider Church before innovating in the areas of worship, doctrine, discipline or church government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cf.ac.uk/clr/networks/Church%20of%20Scotland.pdf Church of Scotland], Cardiff Law School&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a provision which prevents the General Assembly from making core innovations which might profoundly affect the [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]] of the church without first referring these to the presbyteries.  A matter which falls under the Barrier Act must first be passed by the General Assembly, then be referred in the form of an ''overture'' to the [[Presbytery (presbyterian church)|presbyteries]] and ratified by a majority of these, before being returned to the General Assembly of the following year and passed again there.  This is intended to prevent rash decisions to the long-term detriment of the church.  Important matters which fell under the Barrier Act in recent years include the [[Ordination of women in the Church of Scotland|ordination of women]], which was passed in the 1960s, and the proposed union with the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which failed to receive the support of the presbyteries in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/church_law/barrier_act The Barrier Act 1697], Church of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bloomberg Law''' is a subscription-based service for online legal research. The service, which [[Bloomberg L.P.]] introduced in 2009, provides legal content, proprietary company information and news information to attorneys, law students, and other legal professionals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg Hangs New Shingle |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bloomberg-llp-hangs-new-shingle-2010-07-07-194600 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this commercial legal and business technology platform integrates [[Bloomberg L.P.]] news with [[Bloomberg BNA]]'s primary and secondary legal content and business development tools.&lt;ref name="Newswire"&gt;"[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-bloomberg-law-app-provides-seamless-access-to-personalized-content-246539051.html New Bloomberg Law App Provides Seamless Access To Personalized Content]", ''PR Newswire'' (Feb 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS202647+29-Nov-2012+BW20121129 Bloomberg Law Launches Business Development Center]", ''Reuters'' (November 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AALL"&gt;Mary Ann Neary and George D.

== Creation and services ==
Bloomberg Law's web-based platform was first released under a pilot program in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg to Compete with Lexis and Westlaw |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |url=http://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/bloomberg-to-compete-with-lexis-and-westlaw/ |publisher=''[[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]]'' (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "the unit forms part of the data provider's drive to diversify beyond the banks and investment groups that make up the core customers for its eponymous terminals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg Law's Discounts Pose Threat |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6cd25406-fb11-11df-b576-00144feab49a.html#axzz2PPUndiBV |work = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the service was formally launched.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Prior to the creation of Bloomberg Law, two services, LexisNexis and Westlaw, comprised the majority of the legal research market. Bloomberg L.P. sought to separate itself from the competition by offering an integration of the Bloomberg company and financial data with legal research. Bloomberg Law combines content from Bloomberg’s global news network, legal analysis, court dockets, legal filings and reports from Bloomberg legal analysts as well as business news and information. Attorneys can also draw upon stock charts, search patent histories and find information about relevant judges and attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Bloomberg Law Compete With Westlaw and LexisNexis? |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/07/08/can-bloomberg-law-compete-with-westlaw-and-lexisnexis/?KEYWORDS=%22bloomberg+law%22 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is priced to include all features under a fixed monthly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg LP Lays Down the Law |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20101121/SUB/311219986 |work = [[Crain's New York Business]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bloomberg L.P. purchased [[Bureau of National Affairs]] (BNA),&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Danielle (August 25, 2011).

According to Bloomberg BNA, the platform was developed to help law firms grow their top line revenue, provide counsel by getting answers quickly and efficiently, and maintain and increase their profitability.&lt;ref name="Morningstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-news-wire/PRNews_20160121DC04350/bloomberg-bna-announces-support-of-the-legal-aid-society-of-the-district-of-columbia-offers-complimentary-access-to-bloomberg-law-technology-platform.print.html|title=Bloomberg BNA Announces Support Of The Legal Aid Society Of The District Of Columbia -- Offers Complimentary Access To Bloomberg Law Technology Platform|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth and expansion ==
In October 2010, Lou Andreozzi, a former chief executive officer of [[LexisNexis]] North American Legal Markets, joined Bloomberg Law as chairman and Larry Thompson, a former global marketing officer of LexisNexis, joined as chief operating officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legal Briefs: Bloomberg Law Fills Pair of Leadership Positions with Former LexisNexis Executives |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/22/AR2010102205970.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] |first=Amanda |last=Becker |date=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, Bloomberg acquired legal publisher [[Bureau of National Affairs]] (BNA) to bolster its proprietary data and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg's $990M Bid for BNA Succeeds |accessdate=February 29, 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bloombergs-990m-bid-bna-succeeds-203823323.html |publisher= [[Yahoo!

In September 2012, Greg McCaffery was named chief executive officer of Bloomberg Law.

[[File:Travellers attacked by brigands.jpg|thumb|200px|The painting, ''Travellers attacked by brigands'', by [[Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem]] (c. 1670)]]
'''Brigandage''' is the life and practice of [[highway robbery]] and [[plunder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigandage" The first recorded usage of the word was by "[Clive] Holland ''Livy'' XXXVIII. xlv. 1011e, A privat brigandage and robberie."&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced by a '''brigand''', a person who usually lives in a [[gang]] and lives by pillage and robbery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigand.2" first recorded usage of the word was by "H. LUTTRELL in Ellis ''Orig. Lett.'' II. 27 I. 85 Ther ys no steryng of none evyl doers, saf byonde the rivere of Sayne..of certains brigaunts."&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigand is an outlaw who conducts warfare after the manner of an [[Irregular military|irregular]] or partisan soldier by [[Skirmisher|skirmishes]] and surprises, who makes the war support itself by plunder, by extortion, by capturing prisoners and holding them to [[ransom]], who enforces his demands by violence, and kills the prisoners who cannot pay.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 brigandry "1980 Guardian Weekly 28 Dec. 14/2 Today the rebels wound, mutilate, and kill civilians: where do you draw the fine line between subversion and brigandry?"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''brigant'' (also ''brigaunt'') was introduced as early as 1400, via [[Old French]] '' [[wikt:brigand|brigand]]'' from Italian ''brigante'' "trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier". The Italian word is from a verb ''brigare'' "to brawl, fight" (whence also ''[[brigade]]'').

As for the related term ''[[bandit]]'',  a ''bandito'' was a man declared [[outlaw]] by proclamation, or ''bando''.
{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}{{sfn|Rickards|2000|p=39}}

==Laws of war==
Towards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees "respect the laws and customs of war" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are "not persons acting on their own responsibility".{{sfn|Axinn|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC5bIE-q7QC&amp;pg=PA73#PPA89,M1 89]}}{{sfn|Elsea|2005|loc=CRS-17, CRS-29}}{{sfn|Lieber|Lieber|Shelly|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRfPo2jvx8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 95]}}

== Resistance ==
{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}
In certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion.

The Calabrians who fought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Conscription|levies]], which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}  "''It is you who are the thieves''",{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}} was the defence of the [[Calabria]]n who was tried as a brigand by a [[France|French]] [[court-martial]] during the reign of [[Joachim Murat]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

In the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of the Balkans#The Ottoman Empire (15th to 19th c.)|rule]], the brigands (called ''[[klepht]]s'' by the [[Greeks]] and ''hayduks'' or ''haydutzi'' by the [[South Slavs|Slavs]]) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the [[Right to arms|permission given to part of the population to carry arms]] in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called ''armatoli''. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

==Causes==
The conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as [[political corruption|bad administration]]{{efn|{{quote|[...] it would be going much too far to say that the absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very feeble. [...] But there have been times and countries in which the law and its administration have been so far regarded as enemies by people who were not themselves criminals, that all who defied them have been sure of a measure of sympathy. Then and there it was that brigandage has flourished, and has been difficult to extirpate.|{{harvnb|Hannay|1911|p=563}}}}
}} and to a lesser degree, terrain that permits easy escape from the incumbents.{{efn|"in a less degree, the possession of convenient hiding-places. A country of mountain and forest is favourable to the brigand. The highlands of Scotland supplied a safe refuge to the 'gentlemen [[Border Reivers|reavers]],' who carried off the cattle of the [[Sassenach]] landlords" {{harv|Hannay|1911|p=564}}.}}

The [[Scottish Marches]] supplied a theatre for the ''[[Border Reivers|gentlemen reivers]]''.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} After the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–1651), policing the Scottish [[moss-trooper]]s tied up many English soldiers of the occupying [[New Model Army]]. Their contemporaries in Ireland became known as [[Tóraidhe|"tories"]].  [[Rapparees]], Irish guerrillas of a later generation, fought for King [[James II of England|James II]] after the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] and on his defeat degenerated into brigands.

==Terrain==
[[File:Glatt-Räuber8113.jpg|thumb|[[Xaver Hohenleiter]] and his robber band]]
The forests of [[England]] gave cover to the outlaws, who were flatteringly portrayed in the ballads of [[Robin Hood]]. The dense [[Maquis shrubland]] and hills of [[Corsica]] gave the Corsican brigand many advantages, just as the bush of [[Australia]] concealed the [[bushranger]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

The [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], the mountains of [[Calabria]], the [[Sierra mountains (disambiguation)|Sierras]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; of [[Spain]], were the homes of the Italian ''banditi'', and the Spanish ''bandoleros'' (member of a gang) and ''salteadores''  (raiders).  The great haunts of brigands in Europe have been central and southern Italy and parts of Spain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

England was ruled by [[William III of England|William III]], when "a fraternity of plunderers, thirty in number according to the lowest estimate, squatted near Waltham Cross under the shades of [[Epping Forest]], and built themselves huts, from which they sallied forth with sword and pistol to bid passengers stand".{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} The Gubbings (so called in contempt from the trimmings and refuse of fish) infested [[Devon]]shire for a generation from their headquarters near [[Brent Tor]], on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

==Historical examples==
===France===
In France there were the ''[[Écorcheurs]]'', or Skinners, in the 15th century, and the ''Chauffeurs'' around the time of the revolution. The first were large bands of discharged [[mercenary]] soldiers who pillaged the country. The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by holding their feet in fires.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the years preceding the [[French Revolution]], the royal government was defied by the troops of [[Smuggling|smugglers]] and brigands known as ''faux saulniers'', unauthorized [[salt]]-sellers, and gangs of [[Poaching|poachers]] haunted the king's preserves round [[Paris]]. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to violent resistance and to brigandage. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they were not actively supported.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

[[s:Author:David Hannay|David Hannay]] writing in the 1911 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated that in "[[Corsica]] the ''maquis'' has never been without its brigand hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support the law. The brigand is always a hero to at least one faction of [[Corsican people|Corsican]]s."{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

===Greece and the Balkans===
In 1870 an English party, consisting of [[Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster|Lord and Lady Muncaster]], Mr Vyner, Mr Lloyd, Mr Herbert, and Count de Boyl, was captured at Oropos, near Marathon, and a ransom of £25,000 was demanded. Lord and Lady Muncaster were set at liberty to seek for the ransom, but the Greek government sent troops in pursuit of the brigands, and the other prisoners were then murdered.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule, brigandage continued to exist in connection with Christian revolt against the Turks.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== India ===
The ''[[Dacoity|dacoits]]'' or brigands of India were of the same stamp as their European colleagues. The [[Pindari]]s were more than brigands, and the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] were a religious sect.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

Until the middle of the 19th century Italy was divided into small states; therefore, the brigand who was closely pursued in one could flee to another. Thus it was that Marco Sciarra of the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzi]], when hard pressed by the Spanish viceroy of Naples - just before and after 1600 - could cross the border of the [[papal states]] and return on a favourable opportunity. When [[pope]] and [[viceroy]] combined against him he took service with [[Venice]], from whence he communicated with his friends at home and paid them occasional visits. On one such visit he was led into a trap and slain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

Marco Sciarra was the follower and imitator of Benedetto Mangone, who was documented to have stopped a party of travellers which included [[Torquato Tasso]]. Sciarrae allowed them to pass unharmed out of his reverence for poets and poetry. Mangone was finally taken and beaten to death with hammers at Naples. He and his like are the heroes of much popular verse, written in ''ottava rima'' beginning with the traditional epic invocation to the muse. A fine example is ''The most beautiful history of the life and death of Pietro Mancino, chief of Banditi'',{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}} which begins:
{{cquote|
:"Io canto li ricatti, e il fiero ardire
:Del gran Pietro Mancino fuoruscito
:(Pietro Mancino that great outlawed man
:I sing, and all his rage.){{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}}}

In [[Kingdom of Naples]], every successive revolutionary disturbance saw a recrudescence of brigandage down to the unification of 1860–1861. The source of the trouble was the supporters of brigands (like [[Carmine Crocco]] from [[Basilicata]], the most famous outlaw during the [[Italian unification]]){{sfn|Hobsbawm|1985|p=25}} received from various kinds of ''manuténgoli'' (maintainers) - great men, corrupt officials, political parties, and the peasants who were terrorized, or who profited by selling the brigands food and clothes.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

In the Campagna in 1866, two English travellers, [[William John Charles Möens]] and the Rev. John Cruger Murray Aynsley, were captured and held for ransom; Aynsley was released shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Lee|1912|p=627}} Möens found that the ''manuténgoli'' of the brigands among the peasants charged famine prices for food, and extortionate prices for clothes and cartridges.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===Mexico===
The [[Mexico|Mexican]] brigand [[Juan Cortina]] made incursions into [[Texas]] before the [[American Civil War]]. In Mexico the "[[Rurales]]" ended brigandage.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== Spain ===
[[File:Tempranillo by Lewis.jpg|thumb|200px|Jose María el Tempranillo, legendary Spanish brigand of the 19th century.]]
In Spain brigandage was common in and south of the [[Sierra Morena]]. It reached its greatest heights in [[Catalonia]], where it began in the strife of the peasants against the feudal exactions of the landlords. It had its traditional hero, Roque Guinart, who figures in the second part of ''[[Don Quixote]].'' The revolt against the house of Austria in 1640 and the [[War of the Spanish Succession|War of the Succession]] (1700–1714) greatly stimululated Catalan brigandage. A country gentleman named Pedro Veciana, hereditary ''balio'' (military and civil lieutenant) of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona|archbishop of Tarragona]] in the town of [[Valls]], armed his farm-servantsand resisted the attacks of the brigands. With the help of neighbouring country gentlemen he formed a strong band, known as the Mozos (Boys) of Veciana. The brigands combined to get rid of him by making an attack on the town of Valls, but were repulsed with great loss. The government of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] then commissioned Veciana to raise a special corps of police, the ''Escuadra de Cataluna'', which still exists. For five generations the colonel of the escuadra was always a Veciana. Since the organization of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'' by the Duke of Ahumada, about 1844, brigandage has been well kept down. At the close of the [[Carlist War]] in 1874 a few bands infested [[Catalonia]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

The Sierra Morena, and the [[Serrania de Ronda]], have produced the bandits whose achievements form the subject of popular ballads, such as Francisco Esteban El Guapo (Francis Stephen, the Buck or Dandy), Don Juan de Serralonga, Pedranza, &amp;c. Jose Maria, called El Tempranillo (The Early Bird), was a liberal in the rising against [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], 1820–1823, then a smuggler, then a ''bandolero''. He was finally bought off by the government and took a commission to suppress the other brigands. Jose Maria was at last shot by one of them, whom he was endeavouring to arrest.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===United States===
In relatively unsettled parts of the [[United States]] there was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage, in early days, when the travel routes to the [[American West]] were infested by [[highwaymen]].  Such outlaws, when captured, were often dealt with in an extra-legal manner by groups of [[vigilante]]s known as [[vigilance committee]]s.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}  A notable example is the [[Harpe brothers]], who were active during the late 18th century.

'''The Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880''' (43 &amp; 44 Vict c 41) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[Burial Acts 1852 to 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This Act is excluded by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/8-9/27/section/4 section 4] of the [[Welsh Church (Burial Grounds) Act 1945]].

For the construction of references in this Act to a "parish" or "burial board", in the application of this Act to [[Greater London]], see [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/33/section/44 section 44(4)] of the [[London Government Act 1963]].

From 1882 to 1961, this Act was applied by section 3 of the [[Interments (felo de se) Act 1882]].

==Preamble==
The preamble was repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1894]].

==Section 7 - Burials to be conducted in a decent and orderly manner and without obstruction==
This section reads:

{{Blockquote|All burials under this Act, whether with or without a religious service, shall be conducted in a decent and orderly manner; and every person guilty of any riotous, violent, or indecent behaviour at any burial under this Act, or wilfully obstructing such burial or any such service as aforesaid thereat, or who shall, in any such churchyard or graveyard as aforesaid, deliver any address, not being part of or incidental to a religious service permitted by this Act, and not otherwise permitted by any lawful authority, or who shall, under colour of any religious service or otherwise, in any such churchyard or graveyard, wilfully endeavour to bring into contempt or obloquy the Christian religion, or the belief or worship of any church or denomination of Christians, or the members or any minister of any such church or denomination, or any other person, shall be guilty of a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/43-44/41/section/7 Digitised copy of section 7] from Legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''"Riotous"'''

See sections 10(3) and (4) of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

'''Sentence'''

A person guilty of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.&lt;ref&gt;Castro v R (1880) 5 QBD 490 at 508; the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/77 section 77]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of this offence, the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/163 section 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proposal for repeal'''

In 1985, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] said that this offence was no longer used and recommended that it be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Law Com 145. HMSO. London. 1985. Paragraph 3.25 at page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, they said that in relation to cemeteries and crematoria managed by local authorities, this offence was effectively superseded by articles 18 and 19 of the [[Local Authorities' Cemeteries Order 1977]] (SI 1977/204), made under section 214 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Working Paper No 79. HMSO. London. 1981. Paragraphs 12.11 and 12.21 at pages 152 and 160.&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that there was a considerable overlap with the offence in section 2 of the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Working Paper No 79. HMSO. London. 1981. Paragraph 12.13 at page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 11 - Order of coroner or certificate of registrar to be delivered to relative, etc instead of to person who buries==
This section was repealed by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/48/section/13/enacted section 13(1)] of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/48/schedule/SECOND/enacted Second Schedule] to, the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926]].

In [[law]], '''common law'''  (also known as [[precedent|judicial precedent or judge-made law]], or [[case law]]) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | origyear = 1995| year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote = In modern usage, ''common law'' is contrasted with a number of other terms.

A law based on a prior court decision"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For additional cites giving this definition, see [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|the section on the connotations of the term "common law,"]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;  The defining characteristic of “common law” is that it arises as precedent.  In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=5&amp;page=137 5 U.S. 137] (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.")&lt;/ref&gt; The court states an [[legal opinion|opinion]] that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as [[precedent]] to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificBrooding"&gt;“The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky, but the articulate voice of some sovereign or quasi sovereign that can be identified,” ''Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (Oliver Wendell Holmes, dissenting).  By the early 20th century, legal professionals had come to reject any idea of a higher or natural law, or a law above the law.  The law arises through the act of a sovereign, whether that sovereign speaks through a legislature, executive, or judicial officer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=Charles E.|year=1917 |title=Court Decisions and the Common Law|journal=Columbia Law Review |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=593–607}} (common law court "decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law.")&lt;/ref&gt; stands in contrast to and on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] which are adopted through the legislative process, and [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] which are promulgated by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained [[Common law#Interaction with statute|later]] in this article).  ''[[Stare decisis]]'', the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition: Deciding Appeals at 77-87, Little, Brown, Boston MA (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v.

; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law as opposed to equity {{Anchor|3. Law as opposed to equity}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "[[equity (law)|equity]]".&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=4. The body of law derived from law courts as opposed to those sitting in equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salmond32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef2"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote=Second, with the development of equity and equitable rights and remedies, ''common law'' and equitable courts, procedure, rights, and remedies, etc., are frequently contrasted, and in this sense ''common law'' is distinguished from ''equity.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two complementary court systems: courts of "law" which could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive, as discussed [[Common law#CL Misconceptions|in the section on "misconceptions"]].

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

=== Misconceptions and imprecise nonlawyer usages{{anchor|CL_Misconceptions}} ===

A number of misconceptions of the term "common law" exist in popular culture and non-lawyer sources.
* Under the modern view, “common law” is not grounded in “custom” or "ancient usage", but rather acquires force of law instantly (without the delay implied by the term "custom" or "ancient") when pronounced by a higher court, because and to the extent the proposition is stated in judicial opinion.&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificBrooding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; From the earliest times through the late 19th century, the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules, a social standard of justice that existed in the habits, customs, and thoughts of the people. Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of a judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law “decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law”.&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old "pre-existing custom" view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be "law" and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become "custom", and questions of what "custom" might have been at some "ancient" time are simply irrelevant.
* Common law, as the term is used among lawyers in the present day, is not frozen in time, and no longer beholden to 11th, 13th, or 17th century English law. Rather, the common law evolves daily and immediately as courts issue precedential decisions (as explained [[Common law#Principles Common Law Evolves|later in this article]]), and all parties in the legal system (courts, lawyers, and all others) are responsible for up-to-date knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ended prayer in public schools immediately, and same-sex marriage became legal throughout the United States immediately on the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no fixed reference point (for example the 11th or 18th centuries) for the definition of "common law", except in a handful of isolated contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution#The historical test|applicability of the Seventh Amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what was "customary" in the 13th or 17th or 18th century has no part of the common law today; much of the common law today has no antecedent in those earlier centuries. Among legal professionals (lawyers and judges), the change in understanding occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (as explained [[Common law#History and Holmes|later in this article]]),&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; though lay dictionaries were decades behind in recognizing the change.
* The common law is not "unwritten". Common law exists in writing—as must any law that is to be applied consistently—in the written decisions of judges.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1" /&gt;
* Common law is not the product of "universal consent". Rather, the common law is often anti-majoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', No. 10 and 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, Alexander M. "The Least Dangerous Branch." Yale University Press; 2d Ed. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[London]], early 19th century.]]

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries.

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

=== Other alternatives ===

The former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.

Much of the [[Muslim world]] uses [[Sharia]] (also called [[Sharia|Islamic law]]).

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

==== Post-partition India (1948){{anchor|CL India}} ====

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 395 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Post-partition, [[Law of India|India]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=[[K. G. Balakrishnan]]|title=An Overview of the Indian Justice Delivery Mechanism|url=http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|event=International Conference of the Presidents of the Supreme Courts of the World|location=Abu Dhabi|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=23–24 March 2008|quote=India, being a common law country, derives most of its modern judicial framework from the British legal system.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102153013/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence. Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

==== Post-partition Pakistan (1948){{anchor|CL Pakistan}} ====

Post-partition, [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/REVIEW_P_46&amp;47_2011_full.pdf |title=Federation of Pakistan v. Bhatti, "''in a common law jurisdiction such as ours''" |format=PDF|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-partition Bangladesh (1968){{anchor|CL Bangladesh}} ====

Post-partition, Bangladesh retained its common law system.

=== Canada (1867){{anchor|CL Canada}} ===

[[Canadian law|Canada]] has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

== Scholarly works ==
[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''Comparative law wikis''' are [[wiki]]s that allow users to create empirical cross-reference datasets for the analysis of the world's myriad [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]. Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as [[comparative politics]], [[comparative religion]].

==Examples==

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ler.edu.au/pdf/vol19_fullpapers/ler_vol19_paper3.pdf|title=Normann Witzleb, Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy.  Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawin.org/comparative-law/|title=World Encyclopedia of Law|publisher=LAWi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wex]], the online legal encyclopedia created by [[Cornell Law School]]'s [[Legal Information Institute]]. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).

== Usefulness ==

Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing [[comparative law|comparative legal]] analysis.  Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|last2=Mighell|first2=Tom|title=Wikis for the Legal Profession|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911023153/http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|archivedate=11 April 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crowdsourcing]] permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.  

Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

'''Cultural property''' are physical items that are part of the [[cultural heritage]] of a group or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; They include such items as historic buildings, works of art, archaeological sites, libraries and museums.

==Definition==
Article 1 of the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] of 1954 defines cultural property as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention 1954] at the UNESCO website&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:
:(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;
:(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a); 
:(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'."

==Emblem==
[[File:Denkmal.png|thumb|upright=0.4|The cultural property emblem]]
Article 16 of the Convention describes the internationally recognized mark for cultural property as follows:
:(1) The distinctive emblem of the Convention shall take the form of a shield, pointed below, persaltire blue and white (a shield consisting of a royal-blue square, one of the angles of which forms the point of the shield, and of a royal-blue triangle above the square, the space on either side being taken up by a white triangle).

'''Deliberative process privilege''' is the [[common-law]] principle that the internal processes of the executive branch of a government are immune from normal disclosure or discovery in civil litigations, [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests, etc.

The theory behind the protection is that by guaranteeing confidentiality, the government will receive better or more candid advice, recommendations and opinions, resulting in better decisions for society as a whole.  The deliberative process privilege is often in [[dynamic tension]] with the principle of maximal transparency in government.

In the context of the U.S. presidential offices and their workproducts, this principle is often referred to as [[executive privilege]], or as a type of executive privilege that is distinct from "presidential communications privilege".

'''''Domicilium citandi et executandi''''' is a [[Latin]] legal term meaning the address nominated by a party in a [[legal contract]] where legal notices may be sent; the onus usually being upon that party to notify the other signatory of any change in address, especially to be ready to receive any notice that is delivered to that address.

For instance, the delivery of a [[legal notice]] to the address of the ''domicilium citandi et executandi'' of a party to a contract can be considered legally sufficient for that notice to be considered received by that party, without the need for the person giving notice actually to find the person.

One or both parties to a contract may demand the other nominate a ''domicilium citandi et executandi'', typically in order to expedite later legal procedures relating to a contract by making it impossible for a party to claim that a legal notice was not received.

The literal translation from Latin into English is "house for summoning and upkeep".

The Latin term is commonly used within the [[legal jurisdiction]] of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]].

{{Environmental law}}
'''Earth jurisprudence''' is a philosophy of [[law]] and [[human]] [[Government|governance]] that is based on the idea that humans are only one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare of each member of that community is dependent on the welfare of the [[Earth]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="center"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Law center's first case: Saving the planet |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |journal=[[Miami Herald]] |date=May 14, 2006 |quote=Earth Jurisprudence is premised on the concept that Law and governance is meant to protect the well-being of the planet and all components of the Earth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922014545/http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that [[Society|human societies]] will only be viable and flourish if they regulate themselves as part of this wider Earth community and do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental laws or principles that govern how the [[universe]] functions, which is the ‘Great Jurisprudence’.

Earth jurisprudence can be differentiated from the Great jurisprudence, but can also be understood as being embedded within it. Earth jurisprudence can be seen as a special case of the Great Jurisprudence, applying universal principles to the governmental, societal and biological processes of Earth.

Earth jurisprudence seeks to expand our understanding of the relevance of governance beyond humanity to the whole Earth community, it is Earth-centric rather than [[anthropocentric]]. It is concerned with the maintenance and regulation of relations between all members of the Earth community, not just between human beings. Earth jurisprudence is intended to provide a philosophical basis for the development and implementation of human governance systems, which may include [[ethics]], [[law]]s, institutions, policies and practices. It also places an emphasis on the internalisation of these insights and on personal practice, in living in accordance with Earth jurisprudence as a way of life.

Earth jurisprudence should reflect a particular human community's understanding of how to regulate itself as part of the Earth community and should express the qualities of the Great jurisprudence of which it forms part. The specific applications of Earth jurisprudence will vary from society to society, while sharing common elements. These elements include:

*a recognition that any Earth jurisprudence exists within a wider context that shapes it and influences how it functions;
*a recognition that the universe is the source of the fundamental ‘Earth rights’ of all members of the Earth community, rather than some part of the human governance system and accordingly these rights cannot be validly circumscribed or abrogated by human jurisprudence;
*a means of recognising the roles and ‘rights’ of non-human members of the Earth community and of restraining humans from unjustifiably preventing them fulfilling those roles; 
*a concern for reciprocity and the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between all the members of the Earth community determined by what is best for the system as a whole (Earth justice); and
*an approach to condoning or disapproving human conduct on the basis of whether or not the conduct strengthens or weakens the bonds that constitute the Earth community.

== History ==
The need for a new jurisprudence was first identified by [[Thomas Berry]] who identified the destructive [[anthropocentrism]] on which existing legal and political structures are based as a major impediment to the necessary transition to an ecological age in which humans would seek a new intimacy with the integral functioning of the natural world.

The feasibility of developing this jurisprudence (by then provisionally referred to as ‘Earth jurisprudence’) was discussed at meeting attended by Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation in London at the Airlie Conference Center outside [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. A group of people involved in the law and with indigenous peoples came together from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States. (See 'Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay', by Mike Bell, ''The Trumpeter'', Vol. 19, no. 1 (2003)).  

The first detailed exploration of Earth jurisprudence in print and the introduction of the term ‘Great Jurisprudence’ occurred with the first publication of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']] by [[Cormac Cullinan]], launched at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in [[Cape Town]] 2002.

2004 workshop
 
April 2004, first UK workshop held to discuss and develop the principles of Earth jurisprudence, titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023233/http://www.peoplesearthdecade.org/events/calendar.php?event_id=285 'Wild Law Wilderness Workshop: A Walking Workshop on Earth Jurisprudence'].  Donald Reid (former chairman of UKELA, the UK Environmental Law Association) and Cormac Cullinan (author of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']]) lead the workshop in the Knoydart Peninsula (one of the last true wilderness areas in the Scotland).

The feasibility of developing a new form of [[jurisprudence]] was discussed at a conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] attended by Thomas Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation. A group of people involved with law and indigenous peoples attended from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/106/110|author=Mike Bell|publisher=The Trumpeter|volume=19|issue= 1|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the first Center for Earth Jurisprudence established in Florida. The mission of the Centre, which is co-sponsored by Barry and St. Thomas Universities, Florida, is to re-envision law and governance in ways that support the well being of the Earth community as a whole. This involves fostering mutually enhancing relationships among humans and nature and recognition of the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt;

Earth jurisprudence UK conference held in November 2006, 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law'. Based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan.  Held at the University of Brighton and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. Chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

EARTH JURISPRUDENCE IN AUSTRALIA

Australia has a very active Earth jurisprudence and 'wild law' movement.  The first wild law conference in Australia was held in Adelaide, South Australia in 2009 and a second conference was held in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 2010.  A third Wild Law conference was organised in 2011 in Brisbane, Queensland and at that time a core group of Earth jurisprudence advocates formed the Australian Earth Laws Alliance (www.earthlaws.org.au).  The Australian Earth Laws Alliance is the leading organisation in Australia promoting Earth laws and wild law.  For information about their projects, members, conferences and events, please visit their website.

The '''"first possession" theory of property''' holds that ownership of something is justified simply by someone seizing it before someone else does.&lt;ref&gt;"Property". Graham Oppy. ''The shorter Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy''. Editor [[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]]. Routledge, 2005, p. 858&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the [[labor theory of property]] where something may become property only by applying productive labor to it, i.e. by making something out of the materials of nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Fusion of powers''' is a feature of some [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] forms of government, especially those following the [[Westminster system]], where the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government are intermingled. It is contrasted with the more rigorous [[separation of powers]]&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws&lt;/ref&gt; found in [[Presidential system|presidential]] and [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] forms of government where the legislative and executive powers are in origin separated by popular vote. Fusion of powers exists in many, if not a majority, of parliamentary democracies, and does so by design. However, in all modern democratic polities the [[judiciary|judicial]] branch of government is independent of the legislative and executive branches.

The system first arose as a result of political evolution in the [[United Kingdom]] over many centuries, as the powers of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] became constrained by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Needler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin C. Needler|title=The Concepts of Comparative Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fcssj8yigS4C&amp;pg=PA116|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-93653-2|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''fusion of powers'' itself is believed to have been coined by the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional]] expert [[Walter Bagehot]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090507183313/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nuls/research/wpapers/verde1.html The Harmonious Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Australia===
As Australia has a partially Westminster-derived parliamentary system, the executive branch is entirely composed of members of the legislative branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 2|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter2#ano|website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Senator [[Eugene Forsey]] of [[Canada]] remarked that "in Canada, the [[Government of Canada|Government]] and the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] cannot be at odds for more than a few weeks at a time. If they differ on any matter of importance, then, promptly, there is either a new government or a new House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lop.parl.ca/About/Parliament/senatoreugeneforsey/book/chapter_4-e.html | title=How Canadians Govern Themselves | website=Library of Parliament, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The current [[French Fifth Republic]] provides an example of the fusion of powers from a country which does not follow the [[Westminster system]]. Rather France follows a model known alternatively as a [[semi-presidential system]] or 'mixed presidential-parliamentary' system, which exists somewhere between [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]] and [[Presidential system|presidential democracies]].

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom is generally considered the country with the strongest fusion of powers. Until 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] was a full fusion of all branches, being [[Lord Speaker|speaker in the House of Lords]], a government minister heading the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] and head of the judiciary.

===Sweden===
The parliamentary system in Sweden has since its new constitution in 1974 instituted a fusion of powers whereby the principle of "popular sovereignty" serves as the guiding light of principle of government and forms the first line of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riksdagen.se/en/Documents-and-laws/Laws/The-Constitution/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
One advantage of a fusion of powers, according to promoters, is that it is easier for the government to take action. There exists virtually no way for there to be a deadlock in the manner that can sometimes occur where the legislature and executive are separated,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/6-lap9a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but see the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] for a counter-example (regarding the dual executive nature of some parliamentary systems).

==Disadvantages==
{{technical|section|date=April 2016}}The disadvantage with a fusion of powers, paradoxically, is the power it gives to the executive, not the legislative, arm of government. In a fusion of powers, the [[head of government]] must have the confidence of a majority in the legislature. If the majority is made up of members of one's own party, the head of government can use these supporters to control the legislature's business, thus protecting the executive from being truly accountable and at the same time passing any laws expedient for the government. A revolt by members of the government's own party (or, if the government is a [[coalition]] or [[minority government]], by supporting parties) is possible, but [[party discipline]], along with a tendency by many electorates to vote against [[political instability|unstable governments]], makes such a revolt unattractive and therefore rare.

Many states have responded to this by instituting or retaining [[multicameralism|multicameral]] legislatures, in which all houses must pass legislation in the same form. The [[responsible house]] is usually the most powerful and the only house with the actual power to terminate the government. Other houses, though, can often veto or at least delay controversial [[bill (proposed law)|bills]], perhaps until the government's performance can be [[general election|judged by the electorate]]. They also provide additional forums for inquiry into the conduct of the executive. In addition, since the government's future is not at stake in other houses, members of the governing party or coalition in these houses can be freer to oppose particular government policies they disagree with. A second approach to curbing executive power is the election of the responsible house by some form of [[proportional representation]], as in the case of [[Japan]]. This often, but not necessarily, leads to coalitions or minority governments. These governments have the support of the legislature when their survival is at stake but less absolute control over its proceedings.

A fusion of powers was specifically rejected by the framers of the [[American constitution]], for fear that it would concentrate a dangerous level of power into one body. However, other countries reject the presidential system for the same reason, arguing it concentrates too much power in the hands of one person, especially if [[impeachment]] is difficult.

'''''Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha''''', 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ruling in 1983 that the one-house [[legislative veto]] violated the constitutional [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha|462|919|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Section 244(a)(1) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], {{USCSub|8|1254|a|1}}, authorized the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the [[U.S. Attorney General]], in his discretion, found that deportation would result in "extreme hardship." After making such a finding, the Attorney General would transmit a report to Congress pursuant to § 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress had the power to veto the Attorney General's determination pursuant to § 244(c)(2).

===Facts===
Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in the [[Kenya Colony|British colony of Kenya]] to Indian parents. Chadha was a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] and entered the United States on a [[British passport]] when studying in Ohio as a [[foreign exchange student]]. After Kenya's declaration of independence from Britain in 1963 he was not recognized as a legitimate citizen or resident of Kenya (as his parents were Indian) or India (as he was born in Kenya). Furthermore, his [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]] was stripped under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] due to his lack of connection with the United Kingdom. After his non-immigrant student visa expired in 1972, none of the three countries would accept him onto their territory, effectively making him ''[[de facto]]'' [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lena|title=Faces Behind Famous Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/garden/faces-behind-famous-cases.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INS initiated [[deportation]] proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to § 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to § 244(c)(2). The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] vetoed the suspension of Chadha's deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found he lacked any authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found § 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] to suspend deportation proceedings. The INS appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2).

The House and Senate, as ''[[amici curiae]]'', argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.

Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from § 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating § 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in § 244(a)(1) would also be destroyed, and there would be no relief possible; (2) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it; (3) the action was not a genuine [[case or controversy]], as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenged the statute without real opposition; (4) the action was a non-justiciable [[political question]].

==Holding==
The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment. In an opinion by [[Warren Burger|Chief Justice Burger]], the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a [[legislative veto]] over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the [[bicameralism]] principle and [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The Court rebutted Congress's assertions as follows: (1) § 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause § 406. The legislative history of § 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing [[private bill|private law]]s to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as ''amici curiae''. (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts.

The Court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process—especially the President's veto power—was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action; it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding.

===Concurrence===
[[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Justice Powell]], in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress's action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress's action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the [[anti-aggrandizement principle]]) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the [[Bill of Attainder]] Clause, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Art. I]], § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial.

===Dissents===
[[Byron White|Justice White]], dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the [[War Powers Act of 1973]]. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the Court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the [[President of the United States|president]], but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The Court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the ''[[status quo]]'' situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause.

[[William H. Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]], in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated § 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of §§ 244(c)(1–2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other.

==Aftermath==

Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living in Albany, California, as of October 2015.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after ''Chadha'', although various presidents have issued executive [[signing statement]]s disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], for example, while contested by every president since [[Richard M. Nixon]], are usually grudgingly obeyed. Other processes, such as [[Fast track (trade)|fast-track legislation]], have taken the place of the legislative veto and achieved the same effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking: Cases and Materials |last=Brest |first=Paul |author2=Sanford Levinson |author3=Jack M.

Sections 801-808, allowed Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations. Such a veto had been exercised only once, in March 2001, until 2017, when the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]] under President [[Donald Trump]] passed fifteen such vetoes, overturning various rules issued under the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Senate Joint Resolution 6, Pub L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3818">{{About|judicial philosophy|other uses|Minimalism (disambiguation)}}

'''Judicial minimalism''' refers to a philosophy in [[United States constitutional law]] which promotes itself as a politically moderate viewpoint such as that of retired Judge Sandra Day O'Connor. It is often compared to other judicial philosophies such as judicial activism, judicial originalism, and judicial textualism.

==The minimalist viewpoint==
Minimalists offer very small, case-specific interpretations of Constitutional Law as an alternative to what they see as the excesses of extremists on both sides.  They believe that a stable Constitutional Law is in everybody's interest, and place great importance on the concept of precedent and ''[[stare decisis]]''.  They argue that only very small interpretations away from precedent, narrowly applied, and based on the general direction of society constitute true [[judicial restraint]] rather than any originalist or strict constructionist viewpoint (in opposition to conservatives), while still allowing for a [[Living Constitution]] (albeit one with a much slower adaptation than many liberals would like). Depending on the minimalist's particular preferences, a minimalist on the court would be likely to either very slowly bolster or chip away at [[abortion]] precedents rather than proclaim a lasting ban on or legalization of abortion via Constitutional rulings.

[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]] is often hailed by minimalists as their ideal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass (2006). ''Stanford Law Review'', Volume 58, Issue 6 - April 2006, "Problems with Minimalism."&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurring opinion in the 2011 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[NASA v. Nelson]]'', Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] derided minimalism as a "never-say-never disposition [which] does damage for several reasons".&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;[[Eugene Volokh|Volokh, Eugene]] (2011-01-19) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/19/judicial-minimalism-at-least-of-one-sort-pro-and-con/#more-41851 “Judicial Minimalism” (at Least of One Sort), Pro and Con], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Samuel Alito]], writing for the majority, defended the Court's minimalist approach in choosing to "decide the case before us and leave broader issues for another day".&lt;ref name=Volokh/&gt;

==Summary and complaints against "judicial extremism"==

Largely associated with [[Cass Sunstein|Cass R. Sunstein]], it is a viewpoint which criticizes the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] stance of [[originalism]] as being [[judicial activism]] in disguise.  Minimalists believe that a faithful application of originalist theory would result in a system of constitutional law in which modern societal standards would be ignored, in favor of the now-antiquated opinions held by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], probably including their views on [[gender equality]], [[racism]], and other things, which modern society would find objectionable. Minimalists claim that conservatives who subscribe to originalism are likely to ignore [[precedent]] where it is convenient for conservative political aims. Minimalists also criticize traditional [[American liberalism|liberal]] judicial activism as overexpansive and as ignorant of [[precedent]] when it is convenient to liberal political aims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8779">'''Law Against Rehabilitation of Nazism''' is a Russian [[Memory laws|memory law]] of 2014. It also known as Yarovaya Law, after a Russian politician ([[Irina Yarovaya]]) who was instrumental in passing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0-w0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293|title=Law and Memory: Towards Legal Governance of History|last=Belavusau|first=Uladzislau|last2=Gliszczyńska-Grabias|first2=Aleksandra|date=2017-10-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107188754|location=|pages=293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was originally proposed in 2009. It was approved by the [[Russian parliament]] in April 2014, and signed into law by [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in May that year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurilla|first=Ivan|date=August 2014|title=The Implications of Russia’s Law against the "Rehabilitation of Nazism"|url=http://www.ponarseurasia.org/sites/default/files/policy-memos-pdf/Pepm331_Kurilla_August2014_0.pdf|journal=PONARS Eurasia Policy Memo No. 331|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Contents==
The law introduced Article 354.1 to the [[Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]], making it a criminal offense "to deny facts recognized by the international military tribunal that judged and punished the major war criminals of the European Axis countries [this refers to the [[Nuremberg trials]]], to approve of the crimes this tribunal judged, and to spread intentionally false information about the Soviet Union’s activities during World War II" as well as "the spreading of information on military and memorial commemorative dates related to Russia’s defense that is clearly disrespectful of society, and to publicly desecrate symbols of Russia’s military glory".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The penalty incurred for violating this law is a fine of up to 500,000 rubles (about USD$8,200 as of April 19, 2018) or a prison terms of up to five years, with a ban from certain posts and professions for another three years, and/or up to one year of community service.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/154332-russia-nazi-rehabilitation-ban/|title=Duma passes bill criminalizing rehabilitation of Nazism|work=RT International|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The law has been the subject of domestic and international criticism, due to fears of its impact on [[free speech]] and historical research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A BBC report in 2017 noted that the law has "curbed...the public discussion of WW2 history".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  [[Human Rights Watch]] report in 2017 noted that "[the law's] selective implementation has so far led to several unjust sentences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/18/online-and-all-fronts/russias-assault-freedom-expression|title=Online and On All Fronts {{!}} Russia’s Assault on Freedom of Expression|date=2017-07-18|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Russian government officials have dismissed these objections, noting that the law is similar to many other laws known as [[laws against Holocaust denial]], particularly common in Europe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historian Ivan Kurilla addressed that, saying that while the first European memory laws "were propagated by left-wing political forces aiming to preserve the memory of oppressed groups and the crimes of their states", newer laws, such as the Russian one, are increasingly "backed by pro-state right-wing politicians that seek to create a heroic national narrative and legislate away any doubt about the state’s historical righteousness".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Historian [[Nikolay Koposov]] wrote that the main goal of the law is "to promote the cult of the Russian state, whose primary incarnation rests in the celebration of the heroic memory of World War II".&lt;ref name="Koposov2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikolay Koposov|title=Memory Laws, Memory Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S42DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|date=12 October 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-41972-7|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Shortly after its passage, the law was used to convict Russian blogger Vladimir Luzgin, who compared the September 1939 [[German invasion of Poland]] to the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] and referred to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], writing on Russian social media platform [[VKontakte]] that "communism and Nazism closely collaborated". Prosecutors accused him of knowingly posting material that may worsen people's view of the Soviet Union, and the court agreed, stating that he had falsified history by stating "that the communists and Germany jointly attacked Poland, unleashing World War Two, or in other words, that Communism and Nazism co-operated honestly".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2016/07/01/russian-court-convicts-man-of-falsifying-history-for-saying-the-ussr-shares-responsibility-for-starting-wwii|title=Russian court convicts man of ‘falsifying history’ for saying the USSR shares responsibility for starting WWII|work=Meduza|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Luzgin was fined 200 thousand rubles (roughly equivalent to USD$5,000 in 2014) for "circulation of false information about the activities of the USSR during the years of World War II", though, as was noted by human rights expert [[Jacob Mchangama]], this claim was "essentially, factually correct". &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/02/first-they-came-for-the-holocaust-deniers-and-i-did-not-speak-out/|title=First They Came for the Holocaust Deniers, and I Did Not Speak Out|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1467327913|title=Russian fined for reposting that the USSR &amp; Nazi Germany invaded Poland|work=Human Rights in Ukraine|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Lugzin appealed his case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightsinrussia.info/legal-case-of-the-week/vladimirluzgin-1|title=Legal Case of the Week: Vladimir Luzgin|website=www.rightsinrussia.info|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Russian journalist Polina Petruseva was fined 1,000 rubles (USD$16) for posting on the social media platform VKontakte a historical picture showing German Nazi troops in Russia, a picture otherwise available from, among others, [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russia-steps-up-war-on-nazi-imagery-46582|title=Russia Steps Up War on Nazi Imagery|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/08/vladimir-putin-great-patriotic-purge-victory-day-nazi/|title=Putin's Great Patriotic Purge|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, a number of Russian bookstores stopped selling the anti-Nazi graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'' because of a swastika appearing on its cover design.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A toy store selling toy soldiers in wartime German uniforms was also investigated, and a museum displaying anti-Nazi Soviet posters, showing for example crushed swastikas, decided to censor all swastikas on its exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-anti-swastika-crusade/26987440.html|title=Russia's Anti-Swastika Crusade Hits Toy Stores, Bookstores, And Museums|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of two British historians, [[Antony Beevor]] and [[John Keegan]], were banned in one of Russia's regions as the authorities accused them of being influenced by [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37595972|title=Putin backs WW2 myth in new Russian film|last=Bone|first=Harry|date=2016-10-11|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, another Russian journalist, Sergei Vilkov, was fined 1,000 rubles for posting a caricature on VKontakte (in 2011), which combined the logo of the [[United Russia]] and a swastika.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/second-journalist-found-guilty-of-displaying-nazi-symbols-under-vague-russian-law-45952|title=Second Journalist Found Guilty of Displaying Nazi Symbols Under Vague Russian Law|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''law firm network''' ('''law firm association''' or '''legal network''') is a membership organisation consisting of independent [[law firm]]s. These networks are one type of [[professional services networks]] similar to networks found in the [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting profession.]] The common purpose is to expand the resources available to each member for providing services to their clients. Prominent primarily law firm networks include [[Alliott Group]], [[Lex Mundi]], [[WSG - World Services Group]] (multidisciplinary), TerraLex, IR Global (IR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal 500 |url=http://www.legal500.com/assets/pages/networks/international-referral/about.html |website=Legal 500 |publisher=Legal 500 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Meritas (law)]], [[Multilaw]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Multilaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}, The Network of Trial Law Firms, Inc., the State Capital Group, and Pacific Rim Advisory Council.&lt;ref name="LFNG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Firm Networks in General|url=https://ailfn.wordpress.com/resources/law-firm-networks-in-general/|website=AILFN|publisher=Association of International Law Firm Networks|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest networks have more than 10,000 attorneys located in hundreds of offices worldwide.&lt;ref name="LFNG"/&gt;

== History of law firm networks ==
[[File:Law multisdisciplinary and specialty networks.PNG|thumb|450px|right| Growth of networks based upon published directories of networks and associations]]
There are two different reasons for networks developing in the legal profession. The first reason is internationalization which became globalization in the 1990s. Law firms simply needed international connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/shadomx/apps/fms/fmsdownload.cfm?file_uuid=065AE984-1E4F-17FA-D2D7-678F901BAFF4&amp;siteName=lca/ A global practice – perspectives on the internationalisation of legal services markets.]&lt;/ref&gt; The second reason is expansion of a number of large United States firms to become “national”. Smaller firms or firms with a niche practice requested expertise from these networks. 

The [[internationalization]] of the legal profession began later than that of the accounting profession. Unlike accounting firms which conducted worldwide audits, law firms in each country were able to deal with national client matters. This changed in 1949, when [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] began to expand to non-United States markets to assist U.S. clients that were expanding overseas following WWII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakermckenzie.com/firmfacts/firmhistory History of Baker &amp; McKenzie]. Bakermckenzie.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationalization was slow, because the legal profession was more restrictive than accounting in allowing foreign firms to enter and practice other countries. One of the requirements is that the names of the partners should be present in the name of the firm.

In the late 1980s. U.S. and English firms began establishing branches in the primary commercial centers. This new competition in local markets had the immediate effect of forcing local firms to evaluate alternative ways of providing services to their international clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/pubs_pdf/spar/spar-p98-3.pdf|title=A world of Lawyers: the internationalization of legal practice|last=L. spar|first=Debora|date=1998|website=pirp.harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first international networks, called clubs, generally consisted of ten firms in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;The first known clubs was the [http://www.clubdeabogadosibero.com/ Club de Abogados] which had members in all Latin America and Spain. There was also a sister club, Club de Abogados Europeo.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical format was to hold several meetings a year among managing partners, to compare notes on management related issues. They were secretive networks because the members feared losing business from other firms. On the other hand, they would advertise to their clients that they had foreign connections and correspondents. Today the clubs are commonly known as “best friends networks.”  Examples today are: (1) Leading Counsel Network &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/16-november-2009/nine-strong-cis%E2%80%88legal-network-gets-off-ground/ Nine Strong CIS Network Gets Off Ground]. The Lawyer (2009-11-17). Retrieved on 2017-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) Slaughter &amp; May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slaughterandmay.com/where-we-work.aspx Slaughter &amp; May locations]. Slaughterandmay.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clubs evolved into networks in the 1980s. The new networks were not as secretive and even published directories, materials and brochures (Interlaw being one of the first examples).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlaw.org/ Interlaw]. Interlaw. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The members met annually. Some focused on specific practices, such as litigation, while others were more generic. Because networks were not thought of as strategic models, the membership selection process was not particularly rigorous. This selection process is reflected today in the networks which have firms with a wide range of sizes, i.e., small firms in locations where there are firms three and four times the size of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terralex.org/ TerraLex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lex Mundi]] was formed in 1989. It was the first network where each member had to be among the largest and most established firms in a state or country. It was a business that provided members with many alternatives to expand their resources. Lex Mundi is a network organized around strategic objectives, rather than objectives being defined after the network was established. While different from the accounting network, the concept was that of an entity which provided services to members and should also have an established brand. The staff, board, councils and members collaborated to achieve the objectives.

Other networks like TerraLex, [[Meritas (law)|Meritas]] also known as the Commercial Law Affiliates and ij International Jurists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaljurists.com/|title=International Jurists - Global Network of Independent Law Firms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed. These networks were not secret and operated also as businesses. Their stated objective was to create a branded alternative to the large United States and English law firms that had expanded into their countries. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

U.S. national networks also developed in the 1980s. The first national network was ALFA &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfainternational.com/ ALFA International]. ALFA International (2012-01-26). Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a network focused primarily on insurance litigation. The second was the State Capital Law Firm Group which began as a national network of firms practicing in government affairs. To qualify for membership, the firms needed to have a former governor at the firms. Both of these networks became international, changing their names to State Capital Global Legal Network and to [[ALFA International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Torts Legal Help &amp; Advice|url=https://ifspb.com/|publisher=Ifspb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firm networks are here to stay, with more than 170 already in existence. However, networks in the legal profession do not have the same level of respect as is found in the field of accounting. One reason could be that the large New York and London firms were the first to proactively globalize. The networks were simply a reaction to this globalization. Additionally, the large law firms have much larger marketing budgets than networks.  Perhaps legal networks remain tarnished because they originated as clubs or even franchises. However, in the light of day, it is now possible to argue that many of the elite law firms are themselves no more than networks. The world is coming full circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2011/05/grandillusion.html/ The Am Law 100: Grand Illusion], Peter Kalis managing partner of KL Gates, argues that some firms in the AM Jur. 100 should not be ranked because they are not law firms but Swiss vereins. Apparently any form of non-traditional management is not acceptable in the legal profession.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management structure==
The typical network is run on a day-to-day basis by an administrative/marketing office called a secretariat or home office.&lt;ref name="schmidt13"/&gt; The staff may range from a part-time coordinator to more than 20 full-time staff members.

The head office is commonly located in major commercial centres in Europe or North America and do not practice law. Depending on the nature of the network (extension of the members or an independent business) the person responsible for the network will be an [[executive director]] or president/CEO.

The network may be governed by a board of directors who advise on the overall direction of the network. Networks also have representatives who together with the executive director form some sort of management board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meritas.org/ Meritas]. Meritas. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
There are three different types of networks.  The original large networks – Lex Mundi, ALFA, TerraLex, State Capital Group – tended to have large firms who were members. This was because they were competing against large firms opening offices.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, Stephen, Professional Services Networks, at p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; Newer networks are more likely to include smaller firms. Specialty law firms may participate in boutique networks based upon their field of law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Law firm networks may offer their members territorial exclusivity. When that occurs, another firm can not be admitted within their exclusive territory. Such an arrangement ensures maximum referral opportunities and minimal conflicts of interest.

As networks are membership organisations, firms may leave the organisation by not renewing their membership at the end of the year. By the same token, networks may terminate the membership of any member that is unable to meet expected service standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Network members may cumulatively have hundreds of offices. Firms listed in the list of [[List of largest U.S. law firms by number of lawyers|largest U.S. law firms]] have at most 4,000 attorneys. The largest networks include more 10,000 attorneys.&lt;ref name="McGarry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGarry|first1=Stephen J.|title=The Handbook: Law Firm Networks|url=https://www.expertisegroep.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Handbook-Law-Firm-Networks-9-2.pdf|publisher=Association of International Law Firm Networks|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LFNG"/&gt; Based upon the number of partner, the legal networks are comparable to all but the largest accounting networks.&lt;ref name="McGarry"/&gt;

Some businesses with international operations&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.legalbusinessonline.com/site-search/lex-mundi-welcomes-five-senior-in-house-counsel-to-the-lex-mundi-client-advisory-council/81886?keyword=lex+mundi/ Law Asia Business, Lex Mundi welcomes senior in-house counsel]. Asia.legalbusinessonline.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; prefer to use international firms rather than networks as they perceive that service and quality will be consistent. Some observers would disagree with this point of view, arguing that quality is variable across international firms, and that better, more personal service and lower charge out rates can be expected from firms that do not have to bear the cost of offices in multiple countries. Firms belonging to networks cooperate more on cross-border transactions than in the past&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/statistics.php#sotflf/ Harvard Law School Report on the Legal Profession]. Law.harvard.edu. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Niche law firm networks may cooperate more extensively than other networks because of their specialities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} They require members to have a demonstrated level of experience in the network's area of specialization.

Membership of networks may be open to accounting firms also, and accounting networks are also forming alliances with law networks. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;“Accounting Firms Covert Forbidden Fruit: Piece of the U.S. Legal Market, Wall Street Journal,” p.B1 (May 31, 2000), Poe, “Multidisciplinary Practice,” Defense Counsel J. 245 (Apr. 2000), Cannon, “The Big Six Moves In” 50 Int’l Fin. L. Rev. 49 (October 1997), “Andersen’s Giant Step Towards World Law” Australian Fin. Rev. 33 (Jan. 1998), Rubenstein, (Accounting Firm Legal Practices Expand Rapidly. How the Big Six Firms Are Practicing Law in Europe: Europe First and then the World?” Corp. Legal Times 1 (Nov 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; take the position that bringing together a group of lawyers and accountants to create a multidisciplinary association ultimately benefits clients as they often need a wide range of [[professional services]] advisors when involved in large transactions, e. g., when incorporating a new business or in litigation matters, when for lawyers, the litigation support services of accountants can be very valuable. Bringing lawyers and accountants together does not create a multidisciplinary practice (MDP), as all firms are separate legal entities.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, Stephen Multidisciplinary Practices and Partnerships, American Lawyer Media Publishing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; MDPs that involve law firms partnering with non-law firms remain highly regulated or forbidden in most nations and jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market demand – a key driver of the multidisciplinary approach to legal services|url=https://www.ibanet.org/Article/NewDetail.aspx?ArticleUid=b40f0ddb-4c85-422b-84dd-f2f321eee6a5|website=International Bar Association|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Retaining firm independence===
Joining a network is a route increasingly being taken by firms that are seeking to extend their client service capabilities to new marketplaces, yet retain their independence, rather than be swallowed up in a merger with a larger professional firm.  Becoming part of a network can be an effective way to achieve both objectives, create economies of scale, and pool resources.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/msiglobalalliance/why-join-an-international-law-firm-network/ Why Join a Law Firm Network]. Slideshare.net (2011-06-13). Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Client retention===
As their clients grow and move into new territories, small and mid-sized firms need easy access to contacts in cities and countries they can rely on, where they can’t necessarily justify the risk (or cost) of opening their own offices. Rather than lose the client to a larger international firm, networks allow firms to refer their clients to similar-sized members in another jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"/&gt;

Local firms find that sourcing reliable, English-speaking lawyers in foreign jurisdictions can be problematical and something of a lottery.{{fact|date=October 2017}}  Many firms believe that being part of a network minimises this risk and provides clients with reassurance that they will receive similar levels of service from any firm in the network

===Practice development===
The leading law firm networks have developed significantly since the 1970s when most were perceived as clubs, rather than the significant, commercially driven organisations that most have since become. As business has become increasingly global, a large number of firms perceive networks as an important way to develop their practices and to attract larger clients operating on a multi-jurisdictional basis. Others disagree that law firm networks offer practice development opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodine|first1=Larry|title=Marketing via legal networks (consortia): Is it worth the money?|url=http://legalmarketing.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/marketing_via_l.html/|website=Larry Bodine's LegalMarketing Blog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331093103/http://legalmarketing.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/marketing_via_l.html/|archivedate=31 Mar 2012|date=21 Feb 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages of exclusivity===
All networks which may be defined providing exclusivity. This may be a city (in the case of small firms), state or country. Exclusivity can also mean having the right to a specific practice area in a city or state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inblf.com/ International Network of Boutique Law Firms]. Inblf.com (2005-02-03). Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Firm have contractual rights over its own geographic territory for client development and inward referral purposes. As the exclusive member in a particular city or country, firms view this as valuable endorsement that gives them marketing clout when pitching for work with larger clients, and when trying to position the firm as a more attractive employer, particularly in countries where legal talent is more scarce.

===Branding===
Membership in a network gives members the right to promote its affiliation in its territory using the network’s [[logo]]. This can be seen on many member's websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grahamthompson.com/memberships.php Graham Thompson]. Graham Thompson. Retrieved on 2012-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in both parties’ interests that the logo is displayed prominently, with each organisation’s [[brand]] lending force to the other’s. Use of the brand is encouraged, but not usually required, and would typically be implemented across firm stationery, marketing brochures and web pages, ensuring that all [[touchpoint]]s with existing and prospective clients are covered.

Some members prefer not to adopt a network’s [[umbrella brand]] so as not to deflect business from existing non-network introducers of work, the growing need for firms to project a more international image means that access to a global brand is viewed as an increasingly important membership benefit.

===Open discussion in a non-competitive environment===
Many consist of non-competing firms and therefore provide their members with the opportunity to openly discuss issues affecting their firm.&lt;ref name="schmidt13"/&gt;

===Globalisation of the economy===

One of the major factors influencing the need for networks is the globalization of the economy. Supply and demand are no longer local but global. Networks are the practical and cost-effective method to accomplish these objectives. Members of a networks have access to other members who understand their economic, legal and political factors.

      <comment>/* Criminal law */ the change of 2010 to 2009 was because that was the date the new law was passed. In addition, the sentence "increased from 15 to 20 years, or exceptionally more" doesn't make sense because it is irrelevant and misleading. A felony in the Czech Republic carries a sentence of at least 5 years. The numbers given in the sentence are unnecessary and have no significance.</comment>

'''Czech law''', often referred to as the '''legal order of the Czech Republic''' (''{{lang|cs|právní řád České republiky}}''), is the [[Law|system of legal rules]] in force in the [[Czech Republic]], and in the international community it is a member of. Czech [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]).&lt;ref name="bobek"&gt;Bobek, Michal. [http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Czech_Republic1.htm "UPDATE: An Introduction to the Czech Legal System and Legal Resources Online. "] ''GlobaLex''. Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, Sept. 2009. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]] are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.

Written law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important [[Sources of law|source of law]] are: [[Regulation|legal regulations]] ([[Act of Parliament|acts of parliament]], as well as [[delegated legislation]]), [[Treaty|international treaties]] (once they have been [[Ratification|ratified]] by the parliament and [[Promulgation|promulgated]]), and such findings of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]], in which a statute or its part has been nullified as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It is [[government gazette|made public]] by the periodically published ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated ''Sb.'' (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'' (“Collection of International Treaties”).

The system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the [[Velvet Revolution|1989 regime change]]. In 1993, the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been enacted, which postulates the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], outlines the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|structure and principles of democratic government]], and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of  [[European Union law]] over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.

== Sources of law ==

Sources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

* the Constitution (''{{lang|cs|Ústava}}'') and constitutional acts (''{{lang|cs|ústavní zákony}}'')
* international treaties ratified by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|mezinárodní smlouvy ratifikované parlamentem}}'')
* statutes adopted by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|zákony přijaté parlamentem}}''), published decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]
* derived legislation: government orders&lt;ref&gt;also translated as government decrees&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|nařízení vlády}}'') and notifications of ministries&lt;ref&gt;sometimes orders of ministries&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|vyhlášky ministerstev}}''); legislative acts of territorial self-government bodies: regional ordinances&lt;ref&gt;or [[by-law|byelaws]], if you prefer&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|krajské vyhlášky}}'') and municipal ordinances (''{{lang|cs|obecní vyhlášky}}'')

Acts of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are [[Promulgation|promulgated]] (published) in the official ''Collection of Law'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated as ''{{lang|cs|Sb.}}'' – ''Coll.'' – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date. International treaties are similarly published in the ''Collection of International Treaties'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu/ Official online version of Collection of Law and Collection of International Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sbírka zákonů 1993 částka 001 strana 01.png|thumb|The Constitution of the Czech Republic as published in the Collection of Laws]]

=== Constitutional law ===

Czech [[constitution]] is written, and it consists of several [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|constitutional acts]] (one of them [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|the Constitution of the Czech Republic]]), together they are known as the [[constitutional order of the Czech Republic]] (''{{lang|cs|ústavní pořádek}}'').

The constitution can be viewed as [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]], because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concourt1"&gt;Czech Republic. Constitutional Court. [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2092 "Constitutional Order of the Czech Republic. "] ''The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. '' Ústavní soud ČR, n.d. Web. 03 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.

Most important constitutional acts are:

* Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. the Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40450&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=1~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Coll. on the Security of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=46612&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=110~2F1998&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 110/1998 Sb. o bezpečnosti České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 347/1997 Coll. on the Creation of Higher Territorial Self-Governing Units&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content Zákon č. 347/1997 Sb. o vytvoření vyšších územních samosprávných celků a o změně ústavního zákona České národní rady č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of [[Separation of powers|Checks and balances]]. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] consisting of two chambers, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. The executive power is divided between the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] and the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. It describes the functioning of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|judiciary]], especially the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]. Two more institutions are established, the [[Czech National Bank]] and the [[Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic|Supreme Audit Office]].

The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] (''{{lang|cs|Listina základních práv a svobod}}'') is a [[bill of rights]] document enacted in 1991 by the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovak Federative Republic]]. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.

The Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the [[President of the Czech Republic]]:&lt;ref name="concourt1" /&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 71/2012 Coll.&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=77110&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=71~2F2012&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 71/2012 Sb., kterým se mění ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky, ve znění pozdějších ústavních zákonů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which amends the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll., the Constitution of the Czech Republic as amended by subsequent constitutional acts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International treaties ===

On joining the [[European Union]], the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of [[Community acquis|European law]] over Czech law in defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Republic. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "[http://www.czech.cz/en/Life-Work/How-things-work-here/Law/The-system-of-independent-courts The System of Independent Courts]. " ''[http://www.czech.cz Hello Czech Republic (Czech Republic - The Official Website)]''. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 01 Jan. 2010. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important treaty in this category is the [[Council of Europe]]’s [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

=== Statutes adopted by the Parliament ===

Major areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.

==== Criminal law ====

Most important statutes in the criminal justice field are:

* Act No. 40/2009 Coll., the Criminal Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=68040&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=40~2F2009&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 40/2009 Sb trestní zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Criminal Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30139&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=141~2F1961&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered as Code of Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Justice&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=55745&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=218~2F2003&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 218/2003 Sb. o odpovědnosti mládeže za protiprávní činy a o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Czech [[criminal law]] is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 (''{{lang|cs|trestní zákoník}}''), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 (''{{lang|cs|trestní řád}}''). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as [[Age of consent|age of legal consent]]) and 17.

Until 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an "elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html "Obecně o trestním zákoníku. "] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217044737/http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html |date=2013-02-17 }} ''Reforma justice. '' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (''{{lang|cs|zločin}}'') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (''{{lang|cs|přečin}}'') introduces a host of community sentences (''{{lang|cs|alternativní tresty}}''), including community payback (''{{lang|cs|veřejně prospěšné práce}}'') or house arrest (''{{lang|cs|domácí vězení}}''). The code also outlaws doping.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt;

Less serious breaches of law are called [[contravention]]s (''{{lang|cs|přestupek}}'').&lt;ref&gt;The word ''přestupek'' (pl. ''přestupky'') can be found translated variously, even in official translations, as ''infraction'', ''administrative infraction'', ''administrative offence'', ''offence'' (!), ''offence'', ''transgression'', ''misdemeanour'', or ''violation''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record.

Since 2012, Czech law also recognizes [[Corporate liability|criminal liability of corporations]] for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trubač|first=Ondeřej|title=Trestní odpovědnost právnické osoby|url=http://finance.idnes.cz/trestni-odpovednost-pravnickych-osob-dhf-/pravo.aspx?c=A120305_210154_pravo_vr|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skalická|first=Hana|title=Corporate Criminal Liability in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.terralex.org/publication/p58cf9663e3/corporate-criminal-liability-in-the-czech-republic|work=Newsletter - TerraLex Practice Groups|publisher=TerraLex|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Code codifies core areas of [[private law]]. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt; Although the Code does include [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|registered partnership]], it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf "Zákon 89/2012 občanský zákoník.

=== Case law ===

Theoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt; Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforceable rulings of the Constitutional Court shall be binding for all agencies and individuals. " – Constitution, Art. 89&lt;/ref&gt; If a lower court is to rule against "consistent adjudications" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fetter|first=Richard W.|title=Musejí nižší soudy poslouchat Nejvyšší soud?|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/paragrafy/zpravy/museji-nizsi-soudy-poslouchat-nejvyssi-soud/453253|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=České noviny|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.&lt;ref name="concourt2"&gt;Czech Republic.

== History ==
[[File:Theresiana-Titel.jpg|thumb|[[Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana]], 1768]]
In [[Czech lands]], the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], when they were a core part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who participated in creating the first [[civil code]] of the country in 1787, called [[Josephinisches Gesetzbuch]]. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (ABGB). ABGB was [[Reception statute|received]] in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the "Middle Civil Code" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the "New Civil Code", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.

Following in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the [[Constitutio criminalis Josephina]] of 1707 and the [[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]] of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian [[criminal code]]s were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.

The history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] out of the ruins of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the [[Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovak nation]]. This lasted over the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] was enacted after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|communist coup]] – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak ''Socialist'' Republic]] and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Further radical modifications were enacted after the [[Velvet Revolution|regime change of 1989]], but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been promulgated after the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|division of Czechoslovakia]], and entered into force in 1993.

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of law-practice management==
Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011).

[[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s.

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm?

'''Lawtel''' is a subscription-based online [[legal research]] tool that provides subscribers with access to a range of legal information. Used primarily by solicitors, barristers and legal researchers, it covers cases and judgments, legislation, articles and press cuttings, and online precedents. 

One of the most popular Lawtel services is Daily Updates. Subscribers choose from 100 subject areas to receive the latest news pertinent to their practice area. 

Lawtel provides same day reporting for the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] and overnight coverage of selected cases from the higher courts.

== History ==

Lawtel was created in 1980 by a Liverpool solicitor, Graham Ross, and demonstrated at the second annual conference of the Society for Computers and Law, where he was a speaker. Subsequently that year he was joined by a retired  barrister, Gerald Impey. Together they set up a [[Manx law|Manx company]] 'Lawtel Limited', from which Ross resigned a year later. Impey stayed on in various roles until his death in November 1999. In 1994, Lawtel was acquired by [[Centaur Communications|Centaur Communications Ltd]]. 

In 2002, Lawtel was acquired by [[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]].  Lawtel continues to remain a separate service within the Sweet &amp; Maxwell portfolio, positioned as a companion service to [[Westlaw]]. Currently Lawtel has 90000 subscribers, ranging from sole practitioners to universities and corporations.

== Lawtel In Detail ==

The Lawtel service is divided up into sections: cases, legislation, articles and press, and specialist areas. 
Subscribers have access to around 60,000 case reports and the service is updated daily. Cases are reported from the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Civil), [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Criminal), [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], selected tribunals, [[Crown Court]], and the [[County Court]].

Lawtel allows subscribers to track the progress of a piece of legislation, and search for legislation that has already become law.

It offers a full text document delivery service for judgments dating back to 1980. Subscribers can read unofficial transcripts and track specific cases. It also delivers updates on legislation and cases to a subscriber’s inbox, via the Daily Updates service.

Lawtel also offers services for specific practice areas. These include: The Busy Solicitor’s Digest, EU, FirstPoint, Employment, Human Rights, Lawtel Litigator, Local Government, Kemp on Lawtel, and Personal Injury.

== The Impact of Lawtel on Legal Publishing in the UK ==

Laurence Eastham, Editor of the [http://www.scl.org Society of Computers and Law] journal C&amp;L, commented upon the sale of Lawtel to Sweet &amp; Maxwell that:

''"Lawtel undoubtedly made others improve, and move more rapidly than might otherwise have been natural to them. A large number of practising solicitors have been recruited to the need for updated online information by Lawtel... [i]n  short, they made a difference"'' C&amp;L August/September 2002, p.2

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

== Western legal culture vs non-Western legal culture ==
[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

== Western comparisons ==
The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

The '''legal humanists''' were a group of scholars of [[Roman law]], which arose in Italy during the Renaissance with the works of [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Andrea Alciato]] as a reaction against the [[Postglossator|Commentators]].  In the 16th century, the movement  reached [[France]] (Bourges, where Alciato taught), where it became very influential. They had a general disdain for the [[Middle Ages]] and felt nothing good could come from then. They also had a great love of antiquarianism and were greatly concerned with the authority and accuracy of the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]. Thus, they described the work of the glossators and commentators as a malignant cancer on the text. They particularly disliked the commentators because in their attempt to apply law in practice, they had moved further and further away from the texts.

==Overview==

This was the time of the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, where people sought a new birth of society. They believed this would come through a return to the eternal principles underlying classical society. The religious reformers sought a return to the pure Word. In law, the humanists were a parallel movement, seeking a return to classical [[Roman law]]. This involved purifying the texts. The humanists had great confidence in the mind and so originally this was done through a conjectural knowledge of antiquity. However, [[Jacques Cujas|Cujaccius]] recognized the importance of studying the best and most original text, and thus used the Florentine manuscript. This enabled a better study of the interpolations of the text. However, as more and more interpolations were revealed, the quasi-[[bible|Biblical]] status of the texts was undermined, which undermined the work of the humanists.

Since the humanists were primarily concerned with a return to classical society, they were not solely interested in the law, but instead in the historical context. Some humanists placed little emphasis on the law except in respect to what it revealed about the Roman society, for example, Alicus. Pure law was thus given a monumental status. However, this resulted in a move away from practical application of the text. It was recognized that Roman law was the product of Roman society. This undermined the humanist movement as at the same time as arguing that [[Roman law]] was perfect for today’s society, they revealed it was a product of Roman society. The logical conclusion of this was that French law should be a product of French society. The humanists, for example, [[Hugues Doneau|Donellus]], presumed that [[Roman law]] was rational and so tried to find an underlying rational structure. They distinguished sharply between questions of procedure (the means of obtaining an answer) and questions of substantive law (what is due).

==Impact==

The humanists had little impact on the immediate practice of law. Court advocates and notaries remained faithful to the commentaries because the work of the commentators had been better circulated. Since they already knew the works of the commentators, they had a vested interest in ensuring that they remained the basis of the court system. Consequently, there were fierce rebuttals, such as that of [[Scipione Gentili]]. Humanism was largely irrelevant since it was based around the discovery of pure Roman law, and pure Roman law was only appropriate for Roman society.

In the long term, however, humanism did significantly influence legal science. The principle of using the best available text was established and the quasi-biblical authority of the texts was undermined, resulting in the rise of legal science. The systematisation of the texts was both aided and encouraged, giving rise to the Pandectist school. The logical skills of the humanists in their search for interpolations meant that lawyers had skills that were useful for society as a whole. They were thus the natural mediator in Italy when there was no emperor (and they had Imperial authority), they created a comprehensive system of law. When in French the church and crown were opposed, the humanists were able to help the king gain control with their use of logic.

A disputed impact of the humanists was on the law of contract. The Gordley thesis does not consider their work at all, and opponents to this thesis have argued that they were crucial to the development of modern [[contract law]].  The humanists and commentators had reached the point where they acknowledged a large number of ways that agreement could be “clothed” in order to give rise to legal action, however, they still maintained that these were exceptions to the general rule that an agreement could not give rise to an action on its own. However, it was only a small step from this to the recognition that generally an agreement would give an action, but there were a few exceptions. That the transition was not made by the commentators is thought to be because of their adherence to the texts. This was undermined by the humanists. Thus, we might expect that the humanists would have brought the change that Gordley credits to the Spanish NeoScholastics. However, there is no evidence that this took place, perhaps because the humanists despised the work of the commentators to such an extent that they were unwilling to effectively build on the foundations laid down by the commentators in this area.

Most of the humanists were Protestants and so died or fled after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Protestants in 1573. However, the direct link that Donellus fled to [[Leiden]] (via [[Germany]]) and started the Dutch Elegant School, has been questioned by Osler, who points out that the French Humanist school continued after the massacre and that the Dutch Elegant School did not really take off until Noodt at the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osler |first=Douglas J. |title=Legal Humanism |publisher= [[Max-Planck Institute]] |url=http://www.rg.mpg.de/research/legal-humanism/ |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''[[Jainism]]''' is considered to be a '''legally distinct [[religion]] in India'''. A section of scholars earlier considered it as a [[Hindu denominations|Hindu sect]] or a [[Buddhist]] [[heresy]], but it is one of the three ancient Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Jainism|quote=Along with Hinduism and Buddhism, it is one of the three most ancient Indian religious traditions still in existence. …While often employing concepts shared with Hinduism and Buddhism, the result of a common cultural and linguistic background, the Jain tradition must be regarded as an independent phenomenon. It is an integral part of South Asian religious belief and practice, but it is not a Hindu sect or Buddhist heresy, as earlier scholars believed |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105858/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2014, the Government of India explicitly awarded the status of a "[[Ministry of Minority Affairs|minority religion]]" to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992.&lt;ref name=hindu14/&gt;

==History of Jain demand for minority status==
* The Jain demand for minority status is almost a century old, when in British India the Viceroy and Governor General of India, Lord Minto took a decision in principle of giving representation to important minorities in the Central Legislature. Seth Manek Chand Hirachand from Mumbai, an eminent Jain leader from Mumbai and the then Acting President of the Bharatvarshiya Digamber Jain Sabha made an appeal in 1909 to the Governor General for the inclusion of the Jain community for representation in the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manabendra Nath Roy]] (June 1999 reprint) ''The Radical Humanist'' vol 63, no. 3, p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=agJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Seth+Manekchand++Hirachand&amp;dq=Seth+Manekchand++Hirachand&amp;ei=gdGbSfTqGYS6kQTjqv3lCQ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Manek Chand's petition was transferred to the Government of Bombay and the Secretary to the Government of Bombay stated in his reply dated 15 October 1909 as follows:
::"I am directed to inform you that a number of seats have been reserved for representation of minorities by nomination and that in allotting them, the claim of the important Jain Community will receive full consideration. "
* In a Memorandum by the Representative of the Jain Community to the Constituent Assembly in March/April 1947 a strong appeal was made for the inclusion of the Jain community as a minority religious community.
* In his speech on 3 September 1949, Jawahar Lal Nehru said: No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget in fact there are also minorities Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jains. If India were understood as Hindu Rashtra it meant that the minorities were not cent per cent citizens of the country:
* Jainism is mentioned as a religion along with Buddhism and Sikhism in explanation II of the Article 25 of the India Constitution relating to Fundamental Right to religions freedom. On this issue Jawahar Lal Nehru, the then prime Minister, in his letter dated 31.01.1950 assured a Jain Deputation that they need not have any misgivings on this clear constitutional position.
* The second stanza of [[Jana Gana Mana]], Indian National Anthem clearly enunciates Jainism as a separate religious denomination in line with Hinduism, Islam and other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Aharaha tava ahvāna prachārita, śuni tava udāra vāni,'''Hindu-Bauddha-Śikha-Jaina-Pārasika-Musalmāna-Khristāni''', Purava-paścima-āse tava singhāsana pāse, Prema-hāra haya gāmthā, Jana gana aikya vidhāyaka jaya he bhārata bhāgya vidhāta, Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he, jaya jaya jaya jaya he!&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Indian Supreme Court in 2005 ruled that Jains, Sikhs and Buddhist are part of broader Hindu fold, as they are Indic religions and interconnected to each other, although they are distinct religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050811/nation.htm#1|title=Jains, Sikhs part of broader Hindu religion, says SC S.S. Negi Legal Correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendation of National Minorities Commission===

In 1993, the National Minorities Commission arrived at their recommendation that the Jain community be declared as a minority religious community.&lt;ref&gt;National Minorities Commission - notification dated 23-10-1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was in consideration of the following:
*the relevant constitutional provisions,
*various judicial pronouncements,
*the fundamental differences in philosophy and beliefs (theism vs.atheism principally) vis-a-vis Hinduism, and
*the substantial number of Jain population in the country.
It resolved to recommend to the Government of India that the Jains deserve to be recognised as a distinct religious minority, and that, therefore the Government of India may consider including them in the listing of "Minorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Status of Jain Community | work = Ministry of Minority Affairs, Rajya Sabha | publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India | date = 7 May 2007 | url = http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=27576 | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bal Patil Judgement==
{{See also|Bal Patil}}
In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to issue a [[writ of Mandamus]] towards granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://googlecrawl.securities.com/googlecrawler/?pc=IN&amp;doc_id=97181108 |title=Are Jains Not In Minority? Think Again |author=KN Goyal|publisher= Hindustan Times |date=13 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court however left it to the respective [[States and territories of India|states]] to decide on the minority status of Jain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051125/edit.htm#4 |title=Minority rights are indivisible|author=Syed Shahabuddin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the observations of the Supreme Court, not forming part of the judgment, the Court said:&lt;ref&gt;Appeal (civil)  4730 of 1999, [http://www.rishabhdara.com/sc/view.php?case=20276 Bal Patil &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.] [[Indian Supreme Court]] Decided on 08/08/2005&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Thus, '[[Hinduism]]' can be called a general religion and common faith of India whereas '[[Jainism]]' is a special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion. Jainism places greater emphasis on non-violence ('[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]') and compassion ('[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'). Their only difference from Hindus is that Jains do not believe in any [[creator deity|creator]] like [[God in Jainism|God]] but worship only the perfect human-being whom they called [[Tirthankara|Tirthankar]]. Lord [[Mahavira|Mahavir]] was one in the generation of Thirthankars. The Tirathankars are embodiments of perfect human-beings who have achieved human excellence at mental and physical levels. In philosophical sense, Jainism is a reformist movement amongst Hindus like [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahamsamajis]], [[Arya Samaj|Aryasamajis]] and [[Lingayatism|Lingayats]]. The three main principles of Jainism are Ahimsa, [[Anekantavada|Anekantvad]] and Aparigrah.}}

The Supreme Court also noted: " … that the State Governments of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]] have already notified Jains as 'minority' in accordance with the provisions of the respective State Minority Commissions Act."&lt;ref&gt;[para 7 of the Bal Patil Judgment]&lt;/ref&gt;

This cast a doubt on the independent standing of Jain religion. Scholars in the Jain tradition, as well as several groups amongst the Jain community protested, and emphasised that Jain religion stands as a religion in its own right. While Hinduism as a mode of living, and as a culture is to be found across various religions in India because of several common customs, traditions and practices, but as religions Hindu religion and Jain religion are distinct.

==2014: National minority status granted==
On 20 January 2014, the [[Government of India]] awarded the minority status to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. This made the Jain community which makes for 7 million or 0.4 percent of the population as per 2001 census, the sixth community to be designated this status as a "national minority", after Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis. Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission. In its judgement the court left the decision to the Central government.&lt;ref name=hindu14&gt;{{cite web | title = Jains granted minority status|publisher=The Hindu| url =http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jains-granted-minority-status/article5598368.ece |date=21 January 2014| accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Eye on votes, UPA gives Jain community minority status|publisher= Hindustan Times

====Jawaharlal Nehru====
[[File:PMO letter to Jains.jpg|thumb|250px|Prime Ministers letter to jain delegation]]

On 3 September 1949, while addressing a public meeting at [[Allahabad]], the first Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] said:&lt;ref&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru's speech reported in the English daily newspaper ''The Statesman'' dated 5 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

:"No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget the fact that there were also minorities - Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs and Jains. If India was understood as a Hindu Rashtra, it meant that the minorities were not cent percent citizens of this country."

The said speech can be considered to be a clarification on Article 25 of the Constitution of India.

10.2 On 31 January 1950, the PPS to the then Prime Minister of India sent a letter to the Jain Deputation on behalf of the then Prime Minister, which reads as under: (See adjoining image for original letter)
:"With reference to the deputation of certain representatives of the Jains, who met the Prime Minister on the 25 January 1950, I am desired to say that there is no cause whatever for the Jains to have any apprehensions regarding the future of their religion and community. Your deputation drew attention to Article 25, explanation II of the Constitution. This explanation only lays down a rule of construction for the limited purpose of the provision in the article and as you will notice, it mentions not only of Jains but also Buddhists and the Sikhs. It is clear therefore, there is no reason for thinking that Jains are considered to be Hindus. It is true that Jains in some ways closely linked to Hindus and have many customs in common, but there can be no doubt that they are a distinct religious community and constitution does not in any way affect this well recognized position.
:Yours faithfully,
:Sd.
:A.V. Pai
:Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister"

10.5 Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book ''[[Discovery of India]]'', mentioned as under:
:"Buddhism and Jainism were certainly not Hinduism or even the Vedic Dharma. Yet they arose in India and were integral parts of Indian life, culture and philosophy. A Buddhist or Jain, in India, is a hundred per cent product of Indian thought and culture, yet neither is a Hindu by faith. It is, therefore, entirely misleading to refer to Indian culture as Hindu culture."

====Dr. S. Radhakrishnan====

10.3 Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the former [[President of India]], in his book "Indian Philosophy Vol I" mentioned as under:
:"The Bhagawat Purana endorses the view that [[Rishbha]]deva was the founder of Jainism. There is evidence to show that so far back as the first century B.C. there were people who were worshipping Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankara. There is no doubt that Jainism prevailed even before Vardhamana Mahaveera or [[Parsvanatha]]. The Yajurveda mentions the names of three Tirthankaras-Rishabh, Ajitnath &amp; Aristanemi."

15. Dr. Radhakrishnan, who edited the 6th Volume of The Cultural Heritage of India, mentioned as under:
:"The Jains claim a great antiquity for their religion. Their earliest prophet was Rishabhdeva. Who is mentioned even in the Vishnu and Bhagawat Puranas as belonging to a very remote past. In the earliest Brahmanic literature are found traces of the existence of a religious Order."

=="Freedom of Religion Bill" controversy in Gujarat==

The '''Freedom of Religion Bill''' was a controversial bill passed by the [[Gujarat]] state assembly. The bill was passed in 2003. An amendment to the bill was passed on 19 September 2006 which banned the forced conversion from one religion to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Conversion Act passed earlier was not clear on what forced conversion meant and to whom should it apply. Under the amendment Bill, a person need not seek permission in case he/she is converting from one sect to another of the same religion. It clubbed Jainism and Buddhism as denominations of Hinduism, like Shia and Sunnis are of Islam or Catholicism and Protestantism of Christianity. The move evoked strong protests from the state's [[Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Christian]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Commission for Minorities]] also criticised the  Gujarat Assembly's decision to club Jainism and Buddhism with Hinduism terming it to be in contravention of its 23 October 1993, notification classifying Buddhists as a "minority community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/21/stories/2006092102951200.htm| title =National Commission for Minorities criticises Gujarat decision | publisher = The Hindu| date =21 September 2006| accessdate =2008-09-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately on 31 July 2007, finding it not in conformity with the concept of freedom of religion as embodied in Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, Governor [[Nawal Kishore Sharma]] returned the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor  held that Jainism and Buddhism are recognised as religions rather than denominations of Hinduism, something that the Amendment Bill sought to wrongly convey. A press release issued by [[Raj Bhavan (Gujarat)|Raj Bhavan]], said "the proposed amendment would amount to withdrawing the protection against forceful or inappropriate religious conversions, particularly in case of Jains and Buddhists". The release cited large scale protests from different religious and social organisations, especially from the Jain and Christian communities, in indicating toward the unacceptability of the proposed amendment.

==Chronological order of various court judgments on Jainism as a separate religion==

#1927 - In 1927 Madras High Court in Gateppa v. Eramma and others reported in AIR 1927 Madras 228  held that "Jainism as a distinct religion was flourishing several centuries before Christ".  Jainism rejects the authority of the Vedas which form the bedrock of Hinduism and denies the efficacy of the various ceremonies which Hindus consider essential.
#1939 - In Hirachand Gangji v. Rowji Sojpal reported in AIR 1939 Bombay 377, it was observed that "Jainism prevailed in this country long before Brahmanism came into existence and held that field, and it is wrong to think that the Jains were originally Hindus and were subsequently converted into Jainism."
#1951 - A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chief Justice Chagla and Justice Gajendragadkar in respect of Bombay Harijan Temple Entry Act, 1947 (C.A. 91 of 1951) held that Jains have an independent religious entity and are different from Hindus.
#1954 - In The Commissioner Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt reported in AIR 1954 SC 282 this Court observed that there are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God, in any Intelligent First Cause.  The Court recognised that Jainism and Buddhism are equally two distinct religions professed in India in contrast with Vedic religion.
#1958 - In well known Kerala Education Bill's case, 1957  reported in AIR 1958 SC 956,  this Court held that to claim the minority rights, the Community must be numerically a minority by reference to the entire population of the State or country where the law is applicable.  In that way also, the Jain Community is eligible for the claim.
#1968 - In Commissioner of Wealth Tax, West Bengal v. Smt. Champa Kumari Singhi &amp; Others reported in AIR 1968 Calcutta 74, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court observed that "Jains rejected the authority of the Vedas which forms the bedrock of Hinduism and denied the efficacy of various ceremonies which the Hindus consider essential.  It will require too much of boldness to hold that the Jains, dissenters from Hinduism, are Hindus, even though they disown the authority of the Vedas".
#1976 - In Arya Samaj Education Trust, Delhi &amp; Others v. The Director of Education, Delhi Administration, Delhi &amp; Others reported in AIR 1976 Delhi 207, it was held as follows: "Not only the Constitution but also the Hindu Code and the Census Reports have recognised Jains to belong to a separate religion." In the said judgement, the Court referred to the observations of various scholars in this behalf. The Court quoted Heinrich Zimmer in "Philosophies of India" wherein he stated that "Jainism denies the authority of the Vedas and the orthodox traditions of Hinduism.  Therefore, it is reckoned as a heterodox Indian religion".   The Court also quoted [[J. N. Farquhar]] in ''Modern Religious Movements in India'' wherein he stated that "Jainism has been a rival of Hinduism from the beginning". In the said judgment, in conclusion, the Court held that "for the purpose of Article 30(1), the Jains are a minority based on religion in the Union Territory of Delhi".
#1993 - In A.M. Jain College v. Government of Tamil Nadu (1993) 1 MLJ 140, the Court observed that it is also an admitted fact that the Jain community in Madras, Tamil Nadu is a religious and linguistic minority.
#2005 - [[Supreme Court of India ]] gave verdict that Jainism, [[Sikhism]] (and [[Buddhism]]) are distinct religions, but are inter-connected and inter-related to [[Hinduism]], so these three are part of wider broader Hindu religion, based on the historic background on how the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] had come into existence after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jains, Sikhs part of broader Hindu religion, says SC |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050811/nation.htm#1|author=S.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The term '''legal transplant''' was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish-American legal scholar [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|W.A.J. 'Alan' Watson]] to indicate the moving of a rule or a [[system of law]] from one country to another (A. Watson, ''Legal Transplants: An Approach to [[Comparative Law]]'', [[Edinburgh]], 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is [[diffusionism]]-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Watson]], transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.

Laws are commonly inspired by foreign policies and experiences. Regardless of the academic discourses on whether legal transplants are sustainable as a notion in the [[law|legal theory]], they are common practice. Nevertheless, the degree to which new laws are inspired by foreign examples can vary. A frequent and often justified criticism is that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.

German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and his [[German Historical School|historical school of jurisprudence]], which was inspired by the 19th-century [[Romanticism]], have notably promoted the origins of the [[German people]] and their distinctive [[ethos]], or [[Volksgeist]] (“the spirit of a people”). Savigny’s school of legal thought expressed the need of legal change to respect the continuity of the Volksgeist offering a pre-Darwinian concept of juristic evolution. However, this concept of juristic evolution did not leave much space for notions such as legal transplants and the diffusion of law. More recently, Pierre Legrand is one of the strongest opponents of legal transplants.

Today, legal transplants are often mentioned in the broader process of '''diffusion of law''' or '''legal [[acculturation]]'''. J.W. Powell is credited with coining the word “acculturation”, first using it in an 1880 report by the US Bureau of American [[Ethnography]]. He explained that this term refers to the [[psychology|psychological]] changes induced by [[cross-cultural]] [[imitation]]. In a broader context, such notion is by many contemporary scholars applied to legal thought. The diffusion of law is a process of legal change in today’s age of [[globalization]]. Studies on diffusion of law are notably a new area of research in the 21st century.

The '''legality of child pornography''' is explicitly addressed in 94 of the 187 [[Interpol]] member states as of 2008, according to research performed by the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy.&lt;ref name="icmec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/CP_Legislation_Report.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120173350/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/CP_Legislation_Report.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2012 |title= Child Pornography: Model Legislation &amp; Global Review|publisher=ICMEC |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icmec2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/en_X1/pdf/SummerNewsletter2006formatted.pdf |title=Child Pornography Not a Crime in Most Countries |year=2006 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |publisher=[[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602083205/http://www.icmec.org/en_X1/pdf/SummerNewsletter2006formatted.pdf |archivedate= 2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those 94 countries, 58 criminalized possession of [[child pornography]] regardless of intent to distribute.&lt;ref name="icmec"/&gt; This figure does not count legislation outlawing all [[pornography]];&lt;ref name="icmec"/&gt; figures that also include non-specific bans on all pornography would therefore be higher if available.

Convictions for possessing child pornography also usually include prison sentences, but those sentences are often converted to probation for first-time offenders.&lt;ref name= Akdeniz11&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet child pornography and the law: national and international responses |first=Yaman |last=Akdeniz| publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2008|page=11|isbn=0-7546-2297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations such as Canada and Australia have laws banning cartoon,anime, manga or written child pornography and others require ISPs ([[Internet service providers]]) to monitor internet traffic to detect it.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/media_releases/national/2007/queensland_man_charged_over_sms_child_pornography.html

The United Nations Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child requires states to outlaw the "producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing for the above purposes" of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-54-263 |title=Article 3, (1)(c) |publisher=Undemocracy.com |date=25 May 2000 |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120154810/http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-54-263 |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention, the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]], and the EU Framework Decision that became active in 2006 require signatory or member states to criminalize all aspects of child pornography.&lt;ref name= Akdeniz11/&gt; Article 34 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (UNCRC) stated that all signatories shall take appropriate measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.

== International treaties ==

International obligations to pass specific laws against child pornography "punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature" as well as enable extradition, mutual assistance in investigation, and seizure of property were mandated by the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]].

Some of the negotiations and reviews of the process took place at the [[World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children]] held in 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |title=World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children |publisher=Csecworldcongress.org |date=27 July 2002 |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316121435/http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, in the case of ''[[R. v. Sharpe]]'', British Columbia's highest court struck down a law against possessing child pornography as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23215648.html "Canada Court Quashes Child-Porn Law"], ''AP Online'', 1999-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; That opinion, written by Justice Duncan Shaw, held, "There is no evidence that demonstrates a significant increase in the danger to children caused by pornography", and "A person who is prone to act on his fantasies will likely do so irrespective of the availability of pornography."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/national-post.16jan99.html Top B.C. court strikes down child-porn law], The National Post, January 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The Opposition in the Canadian Parliament considered invoking the [[notwithstanding clause]] to override the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/appeal6&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= "Judicial Activism in R. v. Sharpe: An Administration or Perversion of Justice?"], ''Rev. Current L. &amp; L. Reform'', 2000, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not necessary because the Canadian Supreme Court overturned the decision with several findings including that viewing such material makes it more likely that the viewer will abuse, that the existence of such materials further hurts the victims as they know of its existence, and that the demand for such images encourages the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2001/2001scc2/2001scc2.html ''R. v. Sharpe''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430000000/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2001/2001scc2/2001scc2.html |date=April 30, 2008 }} (26 January 2001). 1 S.C.R. 45, 2001 SCC 2.

In the United States, some federal judges have argued that the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines' recommended penalties for possessors of child pornography are too harsh.&lt;ref name=denverpost&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13887009 "Federal judges argue for reduced sentences for child-porn convicts"], ''The Denver Post'', November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of New York criticizes the mandatory sentence for possession of child pornography as often ''higher'' than the penalty for actually committing the act of child abuse it depicts. Furthermore, child pornography prosecutions have led to dozens of suicides, some of them among the innocently accused.&lt;ref name="weinstein"&gt;[http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-dogma/teenage-sexuality/child-porn-laws-kill-destroy-lives-judge-jack-b-weinstein "Cruel child porn laws kill, 'destroying lives unnecessarily' (Judge Jack B. Weinstein)"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The requirement that people convicted of possessing child pornography pay restitution has been criticized by some judges and law professors. This has been particularly controversial in cases involving millions of dollars of restitution, as in those pertaining to the Misty Series.&lt;ref&gt;John Schwartz (February 2, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/us/03offender.html "Child Pornography, and an Issue of Restitution"], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2010, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that restitution directly to depicted minors was an appropriate penalty for possession of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/unsecure/page.htm?shortname=infco20100901158 ''U.S. v. Baxter'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nomination process at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, [[anarcho-capitalist]] and U.S. Presidential candidate [[Mary Ruwart]] came under fire for her comment in her 1998 book, ''Short answers to the tough questions'', in which she stated her opposition not only to laws against possession of child pornography but even against its ''production'', based on her belief that such laws actually encourage such behavior by increasing prices.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Thornburgh (May 21, 2008), [http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1808384,00.html "Can the Libertarians Go Mainstream?"], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; Shane Cory, on behalf of the [[minarchism|minarchist]] United States Libertarian Party in his role as executive director, issued a response saying, "We have an obligation to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, and we can do this by increasing communication between state and federal agencies to help combat this repulsive industry. While privacy rights should always be respected in the pursuit of child pornographers, more needs to be done to track down and prosecute the twisted individuals who exploit innocent children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lp.org/media/article_578.shtml "Libertarians call for increased communication to combat child pornography"]&lt;/ref&gt; Cory resigned after the party refused to vote on a resolution asking states to strongly enforce existing child porn laws.&lt;ref&gt;McCain, Robert Stacy (May 23, 2008), [http://spectator.org/archives/2008/05/23/fear-and-loathing-in-denver 0Fear and Loathing in Denver"], ''The American Spectator''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belize ===
The law in [[Belize]] does not prohibit the simple possession of child pornography.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; It is unclear if distribution of child pornography is illegal.

=== Brazil ===
Production, distribution and possession of child pornography are clearly illegal and widely prosecuted in [[Brazil]] in accordance with its Code of Minors. Also possibly illegal would be simple visualization and lack of denunciation, though it is not directly mentioned in the Code of Minors. Level of enforcement has historically varied by courts. Brazil also [[Ages of consent in South America#Brazil|criminalizes every kind of prostitution]] of those under 18 years of age more severely.

While the simple visualization of [[Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors|cartoons depicting sexual acts involving apparently human minors]] may not be illegal in itself, possession and especially production and/or distribution can be interpreted in courts to be of the same level of actual child pornography, since legislation is vague on the subject (see Articles 241-C and 241-E of the Code of Minors). Such a scenario is very remote though, as Brazilian courts do not often charge people for [[victimless crime]]s, especially those related to sexual misconduct (for example, while the age of consent is 14, the 18-year-old sexual partner of a consenting 13-year-old was once freed after less than two days by a judge&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://estadao.br.msn.com/ultimas-noticias/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=26333837 Brazilian justice system frees man, 18, arrested for publicly kissing young teenager, 13 — Last News – MSN Estadão].

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Child pornography in the Philippines}}

The Philippines passed Republic Act No. 9775 "Anti Child Pornography Act" in November 2009. The Act outlaws the production, creation, distribution and possession of child pornography. It also places obligations on mall operators and owners of commercial property to ensure that violations of child pornography are not being committed on their premises.

Controversially, the Act also creates obligations on internet-related service providers to ensure child pornography is not being stored or transmitted through their services. The Act requires internet service providers and internet hosting services to employ filtering software and to report child pornography violations within 7 days of discovery. How this obligation is to be implemented is yet to be seen. {{as of|February 2010}} the implementing rules and regulations were yet to be released by the National Telecommunications Commission and the Inter-Agency Council Against Child Pornography.

The law also expressly places obligations upon photo developers, information technology professionals, credit card companies, banks and anyone with direct knowledge of child pornography activities to report suspected child pornography materials and transaction within 7 days of discovery.

Prior to the Anti-Child Pornography Act, it was already illegal to use children for pornography and to sell and distribute that material. Under section 9 of Republic Act No. 7610 "Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act", its prohibited to hire, employ, use, persuade, induce or coerce a child into performing for obscene publications or pornographic materials.

In addition, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act no. 9208) also outlaws the [[trafficking of children]] for the use in pornographic material.

===Ireland===
The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 prohibits the production, distribution, sale, publication and possession of child pornography. Penalties include prison sentences and fines. The most common way individuals in Ireland distribute or acquire child pornography is via the internet. Some ISPs have implemented filters that block sites containing child pornography. In early 2015, UPC set up an internet filtering system with the help of An Garda Síochána (The Irish Police Service) to block child pornography which applies to all of its customers. If an internet user tries to access a blocked site, a message will be displayed stating that the material is illegal and that is why the site has been blocked. However, UPC does not pass on the details of customers who try to access blocked sites to An Garda Síochána. However, not all ISPs have filters in place and filters can easily be bypassed using proxy servers.

=== Italy ===
Production, possession, distribution of child pornography in all its forms is illegal in Italy. Italian law clearly designates child pornography as "portraying or visually depicting any minor engaged or involved in sexually explicit activities, as well as the simple lascivous exhibition or genitals or of the pubic region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=49754|title=Pedopornografia solo in presenza di atteggiamenti esplicitamente sessuali|work=Altalex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 March 2006, prohibition also extends to [[simulated child pornography]] in a specific legal designation that defines virtual imagery as "images realized through the modification of real photographs or images of minors, or parts thereof, with graphic elaboration techniques ... whose quality makes non-real situations appear as real". This excludes drawings, cartoons, and other non-realistic simulated child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=78|title=Norme contro la pedofilia e la pedopornografia anche a mezzo internet|work=Altalex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Library of Sweden]] experienced a dispute regarding the alleged collection due to their legal obligation to archive all material printed on Swedish soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/17058/20090121 David Landes of Swedish "The Local": Swedish national library in child porn scandal] 21 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/aktuellt/nyheter/2010/KBs-innehav-av-barnporr-kartlagt/ KB:s innehav av barnporr kartlagt] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; This became publicized as activist groups Hand in Hand and Anhöriga till sexuellt utnyttjade barn became involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/18704/20090406 Peter Vinthagen Simpson of Swedish "The Local": Swedish national library reported for child porn] 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"The criminalization of possession of the drawings would otherwise exceed what is necessary with regard to the purpose which has led to the restriction on freedom of expression and freedom of information."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.se/20120615/41460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Production of child pornography is illegal in Switzerland. In July 2014, the legal age for actors participating in pornography in Switzerland was raised from 16 to 18.

===Turkey===
The production, import, duplication, transportation, storage, export, presenting the same to other’s use, or possession of child pornography is illegal in [[Turkey]].

Article 226 of Turkish Penal Code (Law Nr. 5237) states that "Any person who uses children in production of indecent scenes, words or articles shall be punished with imprisonment from 5 to 10 years and a fine up to 5,000 days.{{explain|reason=normally fines are stated in amounts of money.

=== Ukraine ===
The law in [[Ukraine]] does not prohibit simple possession of child pornography,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; but courts have the authority to limit access to websites which distribute child pornography and to impose financial penalties and prison sentences for those running the websites.

[[Nina Karpachova]], the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said in June 2011 that a significant amount of child pornography available on the Internet originates in Ukraine. It is believed the child pornography market in Ukraine is worth about $100 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011/eur/186415.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Child pornography laws in the United Kingdom}}

In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent image of a child under 18. Before 2003 it was illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent image of a child under 16. The maximum sentence is 10 years' imprisonment for extreme cases, 5 years' imprisonment for high level cases, a summary conviction of 6 months' imprisonment and/or statutory maximum fine for lower level cases.

People have been successfully prosecuted after describing acts of abuse via MMS.&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; [[Operation Auxin]] in September 2004 led to the arrest of almost 200 people on charges of child pornography, and "sting" operations are common.

In December 2008, a Sydney man was convicted with possessing child pornography after sexually explicit pictures of children characters from [[The Simpsons]] were found on his computer. The NSW Supreme Court upheld a Local Court decision that the animated Simpsons characters "depicted", and thus "could be considered", real people.&lt;ref name="TheAge Dec2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpsons cartoon rip-off is child porn: judge |newspaper=The Age |date=8 December 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/simpsons-cartoon-ripoff-is-child-porn-judge-20081208-6tmk.html| accessdate=18 November 2009 |quote=A NSW Supreme Court judge has ruled an internet cartoon in which lookalike child characters from The Simpsons engage in sexual acts is child pornography.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2011, a Tasmanian man was convicted with possessing child pornography after police investigators discovered an electronic copy of [[The Pearl (magazine)|''The Pearl'']] by Anonymous on his computer. The Pearl is available for purchase within Australia and published by Harper Collins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/child-porn-book-the-pearl-still-being-sold-in-australia-after-tasmanian-man-convicted-for-downloading-it/story-e6frg6ox-1226015197430 "Tasmanian alderman David Traynor gets child porn conviction for book still sold in Australia"].

'''Marriageable age''' (or '''marriage age''') is the minimum age at which a person is allowed by law to [[marriage|marry]], either as a right or subject to parental, judicial or other forms of approval. Age and other prerequisites to marriage vary between jurisdictions, but marriage age is often set at 16. Until recently, the marriageable age for women was lower in many jurisdictions than for men, but in many places has now been raised to those of men. Most jurisdictions allow marriage at a younger age with parental or judicial approval, and some also allow younger people to marry if the female is pregnant. The marriage age should not be confused with the [[Age of majority|age of maturity]] or the [[age of consent]], though in some places they may be the same. In many developing countries, the official age prescriptions stand as mere guidelines. In some societies, a marriage by a person below the age of 21 is regarded as a [[child marriage]].

The 55 parties to the 1962 [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages]] have agreed to specify a minimum marriage age by statute law‚ to override customary, religious, and tribal laws. When the marriageable age under a [[religious law|law of a religious community]] is lower than that under the [[law of the land]], the [[law|state law]] prevails. However, some religious communities do not accept the supremacy of state law in this respect, which may lead to child marriage or forced marriage. The 123 parties to the 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] have agreed to adopt a minimum age for marriage.

==History and social attitudes==

===Ancient history===
Historically, the age of consent for a sexual union was determined by tribal custom, or was a matter for families to decide. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty: such as [[menstruation]] for a girl and pubic hair for a boy.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html | title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society|publisher=Faqs.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish oral tradition, men cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of majority of 13 years and one day and have undergone puberty. With no signs of puberty, they are considered minors until the age of twenty. After twenty, they are not considered adults if they show signs of impotence. If they show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry. The same rules apply to women, except their age of majority is 12 years and a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10861-minority|title=MAJORITY - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10888-mi-un|title=MI'UN - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Rome, it was very common for girls to marry and have children shortly after the onset of puberty. Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old.&lt;ref name="Morolli2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Danilo Ceccarelli Morolli|title=A brief outline of roman law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVEjYPaeuTgC&amp;pg=PA53|date=2012-12-07|publisher=Gangemi Editore spa|isbn=978-88-492-7509-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, first marriages to brides from 12 to 24 required the consent of the bride and her father; by the late antique period, Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;Anti Arjava, ''Women and Law in Late Antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic [[canon law]] followed the Roman law. In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;John Noonan, "The Power to Choose" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry without their parents' approval.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sheehan, "The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England" ''Medieval Studies'' 33 (1971) 228–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western European marriage pattern|western Europe]], the rise of [[Christianity]] and [[manorialism]] had both created incentives to keep families [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and thus the age of marriage increased; the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]] instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. The Church prohibited [[consanguineous]] marriages, a marriage pattern that had been a means to maintain [[clan]]s (and thus their power) throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchard, Constance B., 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', ''Speculum'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269-70&lt;/ref&gt; The church also forbade marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greif, Avner |title=Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatism |publisher=Stanford University |date=December 4, 2011 |pages=2–3 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/assa/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002714/https://www.aeaweb.org/assa/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical history===
After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], manorialism also helped weaken the ties of kinship and thus the power of [[clan]]s; as early as the 9th century in [[Austrasia|northwestern France]], families that worked on [[manor]]s were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and State had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace [[paganism|traditional religion]], whose vehicle was the kin group, and substitute the authority of the [[old age|elder]]s of the kin group with that of a religious elder; at the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts by the most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demands by manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter. 1999. ''The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective''. Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd. Pgs 142-148&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[peasant]]s and [[serf]]s lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, they also needed the permission of the lord to marry. Couples therefore had to comply with the lord of the manor and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children; those who could and did delay marriage were presumably rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied that reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/medieval-manoralism-and-the-hajnal-line/|title=medieval manoralism and the hajnal line|work=Hbdchick.wordpress.com|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, marriage ages in [[Medieval England]] varied depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until their early twenties when times were bad, but might marry in their late teens after the [[Black Death]], when there was a severe labour shortage;&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara A. 1986. The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England Oxford University Press, Inc. Pg 96&lt;/ref&gt; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, p. 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval [[Eastern Europe]], on the other hand, the [[Slavs|Slavic]] traditions of [[patrilocality]] of early and universal marriage (usually of a bride aged 12–15 years, with [[menarche]] occurring on average at 14) lingered;&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Eve. 1995. ''Sex and Society in the World of the Orthodox Slavs, 900-1700''. Cornell University Press. pgs 96-98&lt;/ref&gt; the manorial system had yet to penetrate into eastern Europe and had generally had less effect on clan systems there; and the bans on [[cross-cousin]] marriages had not been firmly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Mitterauer, Michael. 2010. ''Why Europe?: The Medieval Origins of Its Special Path''. University of Chicago Press. Pg. 45-48, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded age-of-consent law dates back 800 years. In 1275, in England, as part of the rape law, the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]], made it a misdemeanour to "ravish" a "maiden within age", whether with or without her consent. The phrase "within age" was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, the jurist [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], an influential founder of [[Canon law]] in medieval Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be between 12 and 14, but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than&amp;nbsp;7. Some authorities claimed that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, and the marriage had not already been consummated. Gratian noted that "If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN - BOOK FOUR - TITLE I - Betrothals and Marriages - C3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds: in 1564, a three year old named John was married to a two year old named Jane in the Bishop's Court in Chester, England&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

===Modern history===
The policy of the Roman Catholic Church, and later various protestant churches, of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran Church sought to end these practices, with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Gottlieb, ''The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age'' Oxford, 1993, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1929, Scots law followed Roman law in allowing a girl to marry at twelve years of age and a boy at fourteen, without any requirement for parental consent. However, marriage in Scotland at such young ages was in practice almost unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-in-scotland/minimum-age-for-marriage-in-Scotland|title=National Records of Scotland|first=National Records of Scotland Web|last=Team|website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, the [[Marriage Act 1753]] required a marriage to be covered by a licence (requiring parental consent for those under 21) or the publication of banns (which parents of those under 21 could forbid).

In most of [[Western European marriage pattern|Northwestern Europe]], marriage at very early ages was rare. One thousand marriage certificates from 1619 to 1660 in the Archdiocese of [[Canterbury]] show that only one bride was 13 years old, four were 15, twelve were 16, and seventeen were 17 years old; while the other 966 brides were at least 19 years old.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"&gt;Laslett, Peter. 1965. The World We Have Lost. New York, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. p 82&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Church dictated that both the bride and groom must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families; in the certificates, the most common age for the brides is 22 years. For the grooms 24 years was the most common age, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and 27 for the grooms.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"/&gt; While European noblewomen often married early, they were a small minority of the population,&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. New York, New York: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. p 125-129.&lt;/ref&gt; and the marriage certificates from Canterbury show that even among nobility it was very rare to marry women off at very early ages.&lt;ref name="Laslett, Peter 1965. p 82"/&gt;

The American colonies followed the English tradition, but the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only 9 when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) made it clear that "the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old".&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt; Reliable data for when people would actually marry are very difficult to find. In England, for example, the only reliable data on age at marriage in the early modern period come from records relating only to those who left property after their death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages, giving a biased sample. Additionally, 20th- and 21st-century historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept data regarding a young age of marriage, and would instead explain the data away as a misreading by a later copier of the records.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In France, until the [[French Revolution]], the marriageable age was 12 years for girls and 14 for boys. Revolutionary legislation in 1792 increased the age to 13 years for girls and 15 for boys. Under the [[Napoleonic Code]] in 1804, the marriageable age was set at 15 years for girls and 18 for boys.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 144 of the Civil Code&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the marriageable age for women was increased to 18, the same as for men.

In jurisdictions where the ages are not the same, the marriageable age for girls is more commonly two or three years lower than that for boys.

==Marriageable age as a right vs exceptions==
In the majority of countries the marriageable age ''as a right'' is 18. However, most of these countries have exceptions for minors, usually requiring parental or judicial authorization. These exceptions vary considerably by country. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marrying Too Young : UNFPA Report |publisher=Unfpa.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent.}}

In recent years, many countries in the EU have tightened their marriage laws, either banning marriage under 18 completely, or requiring judicial approval for such marriages. Countries which have reformed their marriage laws in recent years include Sweden (2014), Denmark (2017), Germany (2017), Luxembourg (2014), Spain (2015). Many developing countries have also enacted similar laws in recent years: Honduras (2017), Ecuador (2015), Costa Rica (2017), Panama (2015), Trinidad &amp; Tobago (2017), Malawi (2017). In the US, the lax child marriage laws that exist in many states have attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-41727495/why-does-the-us-have-so-many-child-brides|title=Why does US have so many child brides?|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries, marriages of teenagers have become rare in recent years, with their frequency having rapidly declined during the past few decades. For instance, in Finland, where underage youth can obtain a special judicial authorization to marry, there are only 30–40 such marriages per year in the early 21st century (with most of the spouses being aged 17), while in the early 1990s, more than 100 underage marriages were registered each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/12986-un-urges-finland-to-prohibit-child-marriage.html|title=UN urges Finland to prohibit child marriage|author=Aleksi Teivainen|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the age of majority==
{{See|Age of majority|Minor (law)}}
The marriage age ''as a right'' is usually the same with the [[age of majority]] which is 18 in most countries. However, in some countries the age of majority is under 18, while in others it is 19, 20 or 21. In Canada for example, the age of majority is 19 in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[British Columbia]], 
[[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]] and  [[Nunavut]], and marriage under 19 in these provinces requires parental or court consent (see [[Marriage in Canada]]). In many jurisdictions, by marriage minors become  [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/automatic-emancipation-of-minors.html|title=Automatic Emancipation of Minors - FindLaw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The marriageable age ''as a right'' is 18 in all European countries, with the exception of [[Andorra]] and [[Scotland]] where it is 16 (for both sexes). Existing ''exceptions'' to this general rule (usually requiring special judicial or parental consent) are discussed below. In both the [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]] the marriageable age falls within the jurisdiction of individual member states. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul convention]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention of Belem do Para and the Istanbul Convention : A response to violence against women worldwide |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; only requires countries which ratify it to prohibit [[forced marriage]] (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32), but does not make any reference to a minimum age of marriage.

===Islam===
In Quran, the "age of marriage" coincides with puberty. Classical Islamic law (Sharia) does not have a marriageable age because there is no minimum age at which puberty can occur. In Islam there is no set age for marriage, the condition is physical (bulugh) maturity and mental (rushd) maturity. So the age is variable. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad, who is said to serve as a role model (al-uswatu'l-hasana) for every Muslim, is reported by Sunni [[Hadith]] sources to have married Aisha when she was six or seven years old, with the marriage [[consummate]]d when she was nine years old (or according to some sources ten years old) and he was 54 years old.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spellberg40/&gt;&lt;ref name=armstrong157/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child marriage: a silent health and human rights issue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barlas|2002|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Büchler and Schlater observe that ''"marriageable age according to classical Islamic law coincides with the occurrence of puberty. The notion of puberty refers to signs of physical maturity such as the emission of semen or the onset of menstruation"'', but then claim the schools of Islamic jurisprudence ([[madhaahib]]) set the following marriageable ages for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/78204/1/Beitrag_Buechler_Schlatter_final.pdf |title=Marriage Age in Islamic and Contemporary Muslim Family Laws: A Comparative Survey |last1=Büchler |first1=Andrea |last2=Schlatter |first2=Christina |journal=Electronic Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law |volume=1 |issn=1664-5707 |date=2013 |publisher=University of Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However other sources give different ages.

The [[Reliance of the Traveller]], frequently considered the definitive summary of Shafi'i jurisprudence, states in the chapter on marriage as follows:

::''32.2a. A father arranging the marriage of a virgin daughter: A father can arrange the marriage of his virgin daughter without her permission even if she is beyond the age of puberty. It is up to him whether he consults her or not.''
::''32.2b. Someone other than the father arranging the marriage of a virgin: However, if anyone other than the father is arranging the marriage of a virgin, such as a guardian appointed in the father's will or anyone else, he cannot give her in marriage unless she is beyond the age of puberty and has given her consent. In this case her silence is taken as consent.''&lt;ref&gt;Reliance of the Traveller, by Shihabuddin Abu al-'Abbas Ahmad ibn an-Naqib al-Misri, translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, republished by Amana 1994, {{ISBN|0-9638342-0-7}}; Chapter M, part 32.2&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shaf'i jurisprudence is contradicted by hadith from Bukhari which states that a marriage is impossible without the consent of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/163990|title=Her father forced her to get married; is this marriage valid and what is the ruling on intercourse in this case? - islamqa.info|website=islamqa.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to proposed Saudi marriage reforms in 2009, it was observed that ''"although girls can marry even before reaching puberty, they cannot terminate the wedding contracts according to the Hanbali legal school, one of four major schools in Sunni Islam, which gives complete control over the female to the male guardian"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/saudi-push-to-end-child-marriages-1.541430|title=Saudi push to end child marriages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
The [[Manu Smriti]] recommends arranged marriages for girls before they are 12 years old.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu09.htm |website=www.sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If unmarried for 3 years after 12 years old (At 15 years old), the damsel (virgin woman) may marry on her own will somebody from her own caste and rank by freewill.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;  Bhishma states a similar thing in Anushasana Prava of the Mahabharata. If the girl is unmarried for 3 years after the appearance of puberty (after 12 years and 8 months), then in the 4th year (at 16) she is to look for a husband herself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b009.htm |website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manu Smriti states that a 30 year old man is to marry a 12 year old maiden (virgin woman) or a 24 year old man is to marry an 8 year old girl (child) if the duties of the man would be impeded.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;  In Anushasana Prava of the Mahabharata, Bhishma states, a 30 year old person is to marry a 10 year old girl or a 21 year old person is to marry a 7 year old girl.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In [[philosophy]], the '''natural order''' is the [[morality|moral]] source from which [[natural law]] seeks to derive its [[authority]].  Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of [[law]], which natural law attempts to reinforce. This is related to [[Dharma]].

In contrast, [[divine law]] seeks authority from [[God]], and [[Jurisprudence|positive law]] seeks authority from [[government]].

The term is used by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] in his book, ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed|Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]]'', to defend [[anarcho-capitalism]].

The term is used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

'''''P.P v. Health Service Executive''''' was a 2014 case in the [[High Court (Ireland)|Irish High Court]] to rule on whether a [[pregnant]] woman (anonymised as "N.P.") who was [[brain dead]] ought to be kept on [[life support]] until the [[foetus]] was [[Fetal viability|viable]] and could be [[Childbirth|delivered]]. The woman's [[next of kin]] wished her life support to be switched off but medical staff were unsure whether this would violate the [[fetal rights|foetus' right]] to life, which is guaranteed by the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]]. The case was brought against the [[Health Service Executive]] (HSE) by N.P.'s father "P.P."

==Timeline==
On 27 November 2014, a woman, twelve to fourteen weeks pregnant, was admitted to hospital with headaches and nausea. Two days later, she suffered a fall and was later found to be unresponsive. On 3 December, she was declared clinically brain dead.&lt;ref name="nyt271214"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/world/europe/ireland-court-rules-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-may-be-taken-off-life-support.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Irish Court Lets Woman Be Taken Off Life Support|date=27 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016|first=Douglas|last=Dalby|page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was a large [[cerebellar]] [[cyst]]ic lesion causing [[obstructive hydrocephalus|acute hydrocephalus]] and compression of [[brain stem]]. She was placed on life support against her family's wishes. Her parents and partner supported turning off the life support machines. Her two young children did not recognise her when they visited her, and were upset at her appearance.

On 15 December 2014, her father applied to the High Court for life support to be turned off. [[Nicholas Kearns]], the [[President of the High Court]], fast-tracked P.P.'s application for his daughter to be made his [[Ward (law)|ward]], which took effect on 23 December. On 22 December Kearns decided that the case was important enough for three judges to hear it: himself, Marie Baker, and Caroline Costello. 

The case was heard on 24 December. Four [[senior counsel]] were heard: Mary O'Toole for the plaintiff, Gerry Durcan for the respondent, Cormac Corrigan representing the interests of the woman, and Conor Dignam representing the interests of the unborn child. Seven doctors gave evidence.

==Ruling==
In ruling that life support to be switched off, the court held that the woman's right to [[dignity]] and her family's wishes could take precedence because the chances of the foetus being born alive were infinitesimal. The court rejected an argument that the Eighth Amendment applied only to [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Irish abortion law]] and thus ought not to be invoked in a non-abortion case. The ruling also stated "when the mother who dies is bearing an unborn child at the time of her death, the rights of that child, who is living, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical to those just expressed, must prevail over the feelings of grief and respect for a mother who is no longer living." This left open the possibility of an opposite verdict in a hypothetical similar case further into a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="constitutionproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitutionproject.ie/?p=374|title=High Court Ruling Inevitable in light of Medical Evidence, but Questions Remain for Future Cases|last=O'Mahony|first=Conor|date=26 December 2014|work=Constitution Project|publisher=University College Cork|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | accessdate=2013-06-05 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous trial''' or '''post-mortem trial''' is a [[trial]] held after the [[defendant]]'s death. Posthumous trials can be held for a variety of reasons, including the legal declaration that the defendant was the one who committed the crime, to provide justice for society of family members of the victims, or to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person after their death. Due to the heavy cost, they are usually held only under extraordinary circumstances.

==Notable posthumous trials==
* [[Cadaver Synod]] of [[Pope Formosus]]
* [[Pope Boniface VIII]]
* [[Francesco Maria Carafa]], resulting in exoneration
* [[Retrial of Joan of Arc]], overturned her earlier heresy conviction 
* [[Sergei Magnitsky]]
* [[Henry Plummer]], resulting in a mistrial.

A '''pragmatic sanction''' is a sovereign's solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.

When used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI's]] daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

Pragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.
*The Pragmatic Sanction of [[Justinian I]], promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of [[Italy]] following the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].
*The so-called Pragmatic Sanction of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]], issued on July 7, 1438 by King [[Charles VII of France]], limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.
*The German [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1439]], issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the [[Council of Basel]] with modifications. It has been argued that the name ''Pragmatic Sanction'' is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor's endorsement.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], established the [[Seventeen Provinces]] as an entity. 
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] issued by Emperor Charles VI on April 19, 1713, by which the Habsburg hereditary possessions (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, and various other smaller lands) were allowed to pass to a woman (specifically [[Maria Theresa]]) if [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had no male heirs.
**The Croatian [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1712]], passed by the [[Sabor|Diet]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and predating the Austrian decree, allowing the Croatian throne to pass to the female line of the House of Habsburg.
**The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] passed by the Hungarian Parliament, accepting female inheritance in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Charles VI had permitted Hungary to revert to elective monarchy should he die without a male heir; this instrument signalled the Hungarian parliament's acceptance of his choice of successor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Naples]], issued October 6, 1759, by King [[Charles III of Spain]], governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.
*The Spanish [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], issued March 29, 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a Decree of 1789 by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-[[Salic law|Salic]] system established by Philip V with the [[male-preference primogeniture]] system that had historically characterized the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as exemplified by the inheritance by queens regnant [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]], and [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. (See also [[Carlism]].)

The '''rights of Englishmen''' are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists who objected to British rule]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies in North America]] argued that their traditional{{sfnp|Zuckert|2003}} rights as [[Englishmen]] were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.{{sfnp|Tindall |1984}} Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the [[American Revolution]].{{sfnp|Swindler|1976}}{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.{{sfnp|Heale|1986}} However, as the ratification of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. [[George Mason]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], stated that "We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain."{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

==Historical background== 
{{Further information|Fundamental Laws of England}}
[[File:Sir William Blackstone from NPG.jpg|alt=|thumb|18th-century English jurist William Blackstone attempted to explain the rights of English citizens.]]
In the tradition of [[Whig history]], Judge [[William Blackstone]] called them "The absolute rights of every Englishman", and explained how they had been established slowly over centuries of [[English history]], in his book on ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', which was the first part of his influential ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.&lt;ref name=Blackstone&gt;[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the first part of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', pp. 123–24. Scanned in text available at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Yale Law School Libraries online]. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They were certain basic rights that all subjects of the [[English monarch]] were understood to be entitled to,&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt; such as those expressed in [[Magna Carta]] since 1215, the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal case in 1608 that came to be known as ''[[Calvin's Case]]'', or the ''Case of the Postnati'', the [[Law Lords]] decided in 1608 that [[Scotsmen]] born after [[King James I]] united [[Scotland]] and England (the ''postnati'') had all the rights of Englishmen. This decision would have a subsequent effect on the concept of the "rights of Englishmen" in British America.{{sfnp|Price|1997}}{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}}{{sfnp|Pearson|2005}}

==Legacy in United States law==
Owing to its inclusion in the standard legal treatises of the 19th century,{{efn|Compiled by [[Edward Coke]], [[William Blackstone]], and [[James Kent]].}} ''Calvin's Case'' was well known in the early judicial history of the United States.{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}} Consideration of the case by the [[United States Supreme Court]] and by state courts transformed it into a rule regarding American citizenship and solidified the concept of ''[[jus soli]]''&amp;nbsp;– the right by which nationality or citizenship can be recognised to any individual born in the territory of the related state&amp;nbsp;– as the primary determining factor controlling the acquisition of citizenship by birth.{{sfnp|Price|1997|pages=138–39}}

The Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] asserted that the "rights of Englishmen" were a foundation of American law in his dissenting opinion on the [[Slaughter-House Cases]], the first Supreme Court interpretation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], in 1873.{{efn|In his dissenting decision, Bradley wrote:{{quote|The people of this country brought with them to its shores the rights of Englishmen, the rights which had been wrested from English sovereigns at various periods of the nation's history.... England has no written constitution, it is true, but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour. A violation of one of the fundamental principles of that constitution in the Colonies, namely, the principle that recognizes the property of the people as their own, and which, therefore, regards all taxes for the support of government as gifts of the people through their representatives, and regards taxation without representation as subversive of free government, was the origin of our own revolution.}}}}

[[File:United Nations Security Council.jpg|thumb|400px|Room of the United Nations Security Council]]
The '''United Nations Security Council "veto power"''' refers to the power of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[UN Security Council]] (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States) to veto any "substantive" resolution. A permanent member's [[Abstain|abstention]] or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. This veto power does not apply to "procedural" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection|selection of a Secretary-General]], although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors.

The unconditional veto possessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN.&lt;ref name="wilcox1945"/&gt; Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|title='End Security Council veto' to halt Syria violence, UN human rights chief says amid deadlock|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/04/end-security-council-veto-to-halt-aleppo-violence-un-human-right/|work=The Telegraph|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States refused to join the United Nations in 1945 unless it was given a veto.&lt;ref name="wilcox1945"&gt;II.

== Article 27 ==

Article 27 of the [[United Nations Charter]] states:

# Each member of the Security Council shall have a vote.
# Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members.
# Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting.&lt;ref&gt;UN Charter, Article 27, as amended in 1965. Before that date, Articles 27(2) and (3) had specified the affirmative votes of seven members. The change was part of the process whereby the size of the Council was increased from 11 to 15 members.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "power of veto" is not explicitly mentioned in the UN Charter, the fact that "substantive" decisions by the UNSC require "the concurring votes of the permanent members", means that any of those permanent members can prevent the adoption, by the Council, of any draft resolutions on "substantive" matters. For this reason, the "power of veto" is also referred to as the principle of "[[great power]] unanimity" and the veto itself is sometimes referred to as the "great power veto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership of the Security Council|url=http://www.un.org/sc/members.asp|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502061925/http://www.un.org/sc/members.asp|archivedate=2 May 2012|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the veto provision ==

The idea of states having a veto over the actions of international organisations was not new in 1945. From the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920, each member of the League Council, whether permanent or non-permanent, had a veto on any non-procedural issue.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations Covenant, Article 5(1).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 there were 4 permanent and 4 non-permanent members, but by 1936 the number of non-permanent members had increased to 11. Thus there were in effect 15 vetoes. This was one of several defects of the League that made action on many issues impossible.

The UN Charter provides for unanimity among the Permanent Members of the Security Council (the veto) was the result of extensive discussion, including at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] (August–October 1944) and [[Yalta]] (February 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward C.|last=Luck|editor1-first=Vaughan|editor1-last=Lowe|editor2-first=Adam|editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Jennifer|editor3-last=Welsh|editor4-first=Dominik|editor4-last=Zaum| display-editors = 3|title=The United Nations Security Council and War: The Evolution of Thought and Practice since 1945|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|chapter=Creation of the Council|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199583300.do|pages=61–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence is that the UK, US, USSR, and France all favoured the principle of unanimity and that they were motivated in this not only by a belief in the desirability of the major powers acting together but also by a concern to protect their own sovereign rights and national interest.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Winston S. Churchill]], ''The Second World War'', vol. 6: ''Triumph and Tragedy'', Cassell, London, 1954, pp. 181–2 and 308-13; [[Harry S. Truman]], ''Year of Decisions: 1945'' (London, 1955), pp. 194–5, 201, and 206-7; [[Charles de Gaulle]], ''War Memoirs: Salvation 1944–1946 – Documents'', tr. Murchie and Erskine (London, 1960), pp. 94–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Truman, who became President of the US in April 1945, went so far as to write in his memoirs: "All our experts, civil and military, favored it, and without such a veto no arrangement would have passed the Senate."&lt;ref&gt;Truman, ''Year of Decisions: 1945'', p. 207. See also US Department of State: [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm "The United States and the Founding of the United Nations"]. October 2005. Retrieved 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veto was forced on all other governments by the (soon to be) five veto holders. In the negotiations building up to the creation of the UN, the veto power was resented by many small countries, and in fact was forced on them by the veto nations –  US, UK, China, France and the Soviet Union – through a threat that without the veto there would be no UN.  Francis O. Wilcox, an adviser to US delegation to the 1945 conference described it: "At San Francisco, the issue was made crystal clear by the leaders of the Big Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter at all. Senator Connally [from the US delegation] dramatically tore up a copy of the Charter during one of his speeches and reminded the small states that they would be guilty of that same if they opposed the unanimity principle. "You may, if you wish," he said, "go home from this Conference and say that you have defeated the veto. But what will be your answer when you are asked: 'Where is the Charter'?"&lt;ref name="wilcox1945" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] veto system was established in order to prohibit the UN from taking any future action directly against its principal founding members. One of the lessons of the [[League of Nations]] (1919–46) had been that an international organisation cannot work if all the major powers are not members. The expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations in December 1939, following its November [[Winter War|1939 attack on Finland]] soon after the outbreak of [[World War II]], was just one of many events in the League's long history of incomplete membership.

It had already been decided at the UN's founding conference in 1944, that United Kingdom, [[Republic of China|China]], the Soviet Union, the United States and, "in due course" France, should be the permanent members of any newly formed Council. France had been defeated and occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (1940–44), but its role as a permanent member of the League of Nations, its status as a [[colonial power]] and the activities of the [[Free French forces]] on the allied side allowed it a place at the table with the other four.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Use of the veto power ==
The actual use of the veto, and the constant possibility of its use, have been central features of the functioning of the Security Council throughout the UN's history. In the period from 1945 to the end of 2009, 215 resolutions on substantive issues were vetoed, sometimes by more than one of the P5. The average number of vetoes cast each year to 1989 was over five: since then the average annual number has been just above one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The figures reflect the fact that a Permanent Member of the Security Council can avoid casting a veto if the proposal in question does not in any event obtain the requisite majority. In the first two decades of the UN, the Western states were frequently able to defeat resolutions without actually using the veto; and the Soviet Union was in this position in the 1970s and 1980s. Use of the veto has reflected a degree of diplomatic isolation of the vetoing state(s) on the particular issue. Because of the use or threat of the veto, the Security Council could at best have a limited role in certain wars and interventions in which its Permanent Members were involved – for example in Algeria (1954–62); Suez (1956), Hungary (1956), Vietnam (1946–75), the Sino-Vietnamese war (1979), Afghanistan (1979–88), Panama (1989), Iraq (2003), and Georgia (2008).{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Not all cases of UN inaction in crises have been due to the actual use of the veto. For example, re the Iran–Iraq war of 1980–88 there was no use of the veto, but the UN role was minimal except in its concluding phase. Likewise, the limited involvement of the UN in the crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan from 2003 onwards was not due to any actual use of the veto.

Since 1990 the veto has been used sparingly. The period from 31 May 1990 to 11 May 1993 was the longest without the use of the veto in the history of the UN. Up until the end of 1989, the number of resolutions passed by the Security Council had been 646 – an average of about 15 per annum. The figures for the years since then show a peak of Security Council activism in 1993, followed by a modest degree of retrenchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Vaughan|editor1-last=Lowe|editor2-first=Adam|editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Jennifer|editor3-last=Welsh|editor4-first=Dominik|editor4-last=Zaum| display-editors = 3|title=The United Nations Security Council and War: The Evolution of Thought and Practice since 1945|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199583300.do|pages=78–82, 135–7, 155–65, 688–705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the Soviet Union missed one important opportunity to exercise its veto power. The Soviet government had adopted an "empty chair" policy at the Security Council from January 1950, owing to its discontent over the UN's refusal to recognise the People's Republic of China's representatives as the legitimate representatives of China,&lt;ref&gt;Malanczuk, P. ''Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law'', Ed. 7, page 375, Routledge, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and with the hope of preventing any future decisions by the Council on substantive matters. Despite the wording of the Charter (which makes no provisions for passing resolutions with the abstention or absence of a veto-bearing member), this was treated as a non-blocking abstention. This had in fact already become Council practice by that time, the Council has already adopted numerous draft resolutions despite the lack of an affirmative vote by each of its permanent members. The result of the Soviet Union's absence from the Security Council was that it was not in a position to veto the UN Security Council resolutions 83 (27 June 1950) and 84 (7 July 1950) authorising the US-led military coalition in Korea that assisted South Korea in repelling the North Korean attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck|first=Wiliam |editor1-first=Vaughan|editor1-last=Lowe|editor2-first=Adam|editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Jennifer|editor3-last=Welsh|editor4-first=Dominik|editor4-last=Zaum| display-editors = 3|title=The United Nations Security Council and War: The Evolution of Thought and Practice since 1945|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|chapter=The United Nations, the Security Council, and the Korean War|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199583300.do|pages=266–7, 277–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection of a Secretary-General ===
{{Main article|United Nations Secretary-General selection}}

The veto power can also be used to block the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection|selection of a Secretary-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Simon |last= Chesterman |contributor-link= Simon Chesterman |contribution= Introduction |editor-first= Simon |editor-last= Chesterman |title= Secretary or General? The UN Secretary-General in World Politics |location= Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2007 |page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not counted as a veto of a Security Council Resolution, because the Security Council is only issuing a "recommendation" to the General Assembly. Since 1981, no Secretary-General has been formally vetoed, because the Security Council does not vote until they have already agreed on a Secretary-General in a series of [[straw poll]]s. A vote by a permanent member to "discourage" a candidate is considered equivalent to a veto, and the candidate will withdraw from the race without forcing a formal veto. The formal recommendation of a Secretary-General is approved unanimously by [[acclamation]].

Every permanent member has vetoed at least one candidate for Secretary-General. The United States circumvented the Soviet veto in 1950 by asking the General Assembly to vote on [[Trygve Lie]]'s reappointment without a recommendation from the Security Council.&lt;ref name="una-usa-fact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/atf/cf/%7B49C555AC-20C8-4B43-8483-A2D4C1808E4E%7D/SG%20Reform%20Fact%20Sheet-fina-logol.pdf |title=An Historical Overview on the Selection of United Nations Secretaries-General |publisher=UNA-USA |accessdate=30 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025014319/http://www.unausa.org/atf/cf/%7b49C555AC-20C8-4B43-8483-A2D4C1808E4E%7d/SG+Reform+Fact+Sheet-fina-logol.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, every Secretary-General since 1953 has been recommended by a unanimous vote of the permanent members of the Security Council. Vetoes have not been recorded publicly since 1981, because the straw poll is taken by [[secret ballot]]. However, countries may announce their votes to encourage the rotating members to vote for another candidate.

In the history of the Security Council, almost half the vetoes were cast by the [[Soviet Union]], with the vast majority of those being before 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto.htm Veto database and information] at [[Global Policy Forum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1966, out of the total 153 vetoes cast, 119 were issued by one of the council's three [[NATO]] members: the US, the UK and France.&lt;ref name="Security Council - Veto List"&gt;[http://research.un.org/en/docs/sc/quick/veto Security Council – Veto List] at [[Global Policy Forum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1946 to 2016, vetoes were issued on 258 occasions. For that period, usage breaks down as follows:
*Russia and the Soviet Union have used the veto on 122 occasions, more than any other of the five permanent members of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/58/47(SUPP)&amp;Lang=E] United Nations Documentation at [[The United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis by country ==

=== China (ROC/PRC) ===
{{See also|China and the United Nations}}

Between 1946 and 1971, the Chinese seat on the Security Council was the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] ([[Chinese Civil War|that retreated to Taiwan in 1949]]) during which time its representative used the veto only once, to block [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]'s application for membership in 1955, because the ROC considered the country to be a part of China. This postponed the admission of Mongolia until [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 166|1961]], when the Soviet Union announced that unless Mongolia was admitted, it would block the admission of all of the newly independent African states. Faced with this pressure, the ROC relented under protest.

After the Republic of China's expulsion from the United Nations in 1971, the first veto cast by the present occupant, the [[China|People's Republic of China]], was issued on 25 August 1972 over [[Bangladesh]]'s admission to the United Nations. As of February 2017, the People's Republic of China has used its veto eleven times.&lt;ref name="UNSC Research Guide-2015"&gt;[http://research.un.org/en/docs/sc/quick/veto Security Council – Veto List]. Retrieved 13 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have noted a preference for China to abstain rather than the veto on resolutions not directly related to Chinese interests.&lt;ref name=GlobalPolicyForum/&gt;

=== Soviet Union/Russia ===
{{See also| the Soviet Union and the United Nations|Russia and the United Nations}}
In the early days of the United Nations, the Soviet Union commissar and later minister for foreign affairs, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], vetoed resolutions so many times that he was known as "Mr. Veto". In fact, the Soviet Union was responsible for nearly half of all vetoes ever cast—79 vetoes were used in the first 10 years. Molotov regularly rejected bids for new membership because of the US's refusal to admit all of the Soviet republics.  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia used its veto power sparingly.  However, its use of the veto increased in the late 2000s and 2010s, due to a number of resolutions on conflicts that it was involved militarily in, including [[Russo-Georgian War|Georgia]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] and [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://research.un.org/en/docs/sc/quick|title=Veto List|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
{{See also|France and the United Nations}}
France uses its veto power sparingly. The last time it unilaterally vetoed a draft was in 1976 to block a resolution on the question of the independence of the [[Comoros]], which was done to keep the island of [[Mayotte]] as a French overseas community.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite web|title=Subjet of UN Security Council Vetoes|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/102/40069.html|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also vetoed, along with U.K, a resolution calling on the immediate cessation of military action by the Israeli army against Egypt in 1956 during the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; The last time France used its veto power was in December 1989 concerning the situation in [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; In 2003, the threat of a French veto of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|resolution]] on the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] caused friction between France and the United States.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also| United Kingdom and the United Nations}}
The United Kingdom has used its Security Council veto power on 32 occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing Patterns in the Use of the Veto in The Security Council|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/Changing_Patterns_in_the_Use_of_the_Veto_as_of_August_2012.pdf|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first occurrence was in October 1956 when the United Kingdom and France vetoed a letter from the USA to the President of the Security Council concerning Palestine. The most recent was in December 1989 when the United Kingdom, France and the United States vetoed a draft resolution condemning the [[United States invasion of Panama]].&lt;ref name= UNLibraryVetos&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Council – Veto List|url=http://research.un.org/en/docs/sc/quick/veto|publisher=UN Dag Hammarskjöld Library|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom used its veto power, along with France, to veto a draft resolution aimed at resolving the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal crisis]] (in which France and UK were militarily involved) in 1956. The UK and France eventually withdrew from Egypt after the U.S. instigated an 'emergency special session' of the General Assembly, under the terms of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|"Uniting for Peace" resolution]], which led to the establishment of the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] I (UNEF I), by the adoption of Assembly resolution 1001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/sessions/emergency.shtml|title=Emergency Special Sessions|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK also used its veto seven times in relation to [[Rhodesia]] from 1963 to 1973, five of these occasions were unilateral; the only occasions on which the UK has used its veto power unilaterally.&lt;ref name= UNLibraryVetos /&gt;

=== United States ===
{{See also| United States and the United Nations}}
Ambassador [[Charles W. Yost]] cast the first U.S. veto in 1970, regarding a crisis in [[Rhodesia]], and the U.S. cast a lone veto in 1972 to block a resolution that condemned Israel for war against Syria and Lebanon. Since that time it has become the most frequent user of veto power, mainly on resolutions criticising and condemning Israel and almost always unilaterally for war and human rights violations; since 2002, the [[Negroponte doctrine]] has been applied for the use of a veto on resolutions relating to the ongoing [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]]. This has been a constant cause of friction between the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and the Security Council. On 18 February 2011, the Obama administration vetoed resolutions condemning Israeli settlements. On 23 December 2016, the Obama administration allowed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|a resolution]] calling for an end to [[Israeli settlement]]s to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38421026|title=Israeli settlements: UN Security Council calls for an end|work=''BBC News''|date=23 December 2016|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The veto power has brought criticism to the Security Council. As it stands, a veto from any of the permanent members can halt any possible action the Council may take. One country's objection, rather than the opinions of a majority of countries, may cripple any possible UN armed or diplomatic response to a crisis.
For instance, [[John J. Mearsheimer]] claimed that "since 1982, the US has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of [[Israel]], more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy |author=John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt |url=http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP06-011 |work=KSG Faculty Research Working Paper Series |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=26 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202034826/http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP06-011 |archivedate=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since candidates for the Security Council are proposed by regional blocs, the [[Arab League]] and its allies are usually included but Israel, which joined the UN in 1949, [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council#Non-members|has never been elected to the Security Council]]. The Council has repeatedly [[List of the UN resolutions concerning Israel#United Nations Security Council resolutions|condemned Israel]]. On the other hand, critics contend that, while Israel has the United States to rely on to veto any pertinent legislation against it, the Palestinians lack any such power.

Apart from the US, several resolutions have been vetoed by Russia, notably attempts to impose sanctions on [[Syria]] during the [[Syrian Civil War]] and to condemn Russia's own [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] in 2014. In the case of the latter, Russia's lone veto over-ruled the thirteen other votes in favour of the condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UN News – UN Security Council action on Crimea referendum blocked|url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47362|website = UN News Service Section|date = 15 March 2014|accessdate = 26 January 2017 |first = United Nations News Service|last = Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Soviet Union, Russia also vetoed a UN resolution condemning the USSR's shooting down of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] in 1983. The veto has been singled out as a threat to human rights, with [[Amnesty International]] claiming that the five permanent members had used their veto to "promote their political self interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians." As of 2015, Amnesty International has suggested that a solution would involve the five permanent members surrendering their veto on issues of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amnesty calls on UN powers to lose veto on genocide votes – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-31617141|work=''BBC News''|accessdate = 26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the fact that veto power exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic, unjust, or counterproductive. Peter Nadin writes that "The veto is an anachronism ... In the twenty-first century, the veto has come to be almost universally seen as a disproportionate power and an impediment to credible international action to crises."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nadin, ''UN Security Council Reform'' (Routledge, 2016), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The "enormous influence of the veto power" has been cited as a cause of the UN's ineffectiveness in preventing and responding to [[genocide]], violence, and human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Sevak Joseph Manjikian, "Genocide and the Failure to Respond" in ''Civil Courage: A Response to Contemporary Conflict and Prejudice'' (ed. Naomi Kramer: Peter Lang, 2007), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Various countries outside the P5, such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and [[African Union]] have proposed limitations on the veto power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Egede &amp; Peter Sutch, ''The Politics of International Law and International Justice'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2013), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this situation, it has been denounced that the Security Council is only effective when it comes to safeguarding the interests of its permanent members, and is unable to act against them. Consequently, resolutions authorising intervention in the internal affairs of other countries have been few. The interests of the permanent members have come to rest on the concept of non-interference, at the expense of the "keep the peace and security" mandate with which the Security Council was created. Perhaps because, while the "responsibility to protect" is not binding, state sovereignty remains a priority and, as the specialist in international relations Philippe Moreau-Desfarges points out, "even if the rights of their populations are violated, only the Security Council can decide whether peace is threatened and take measures to protect that peace". Thus, the Security Council has not taken forceful measures to punish governments considered as authoritarian, neglecting the "responsibility to defend civilian populations", recognised by the UN General Assembly in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1023594/0/onu/consejo-seguridad/reforma/#xtor=AD-15&amp;xts=467263 |title=El derecho de veto continúa atrancando las decisiones de la ONU 65 años después |accessdate=26 January 2017 |last=Máiquez |first=Miguel |date=19 April 2011 |work=20 Minutos |publisher=20 Minutos Editora |location=Madrid |language=spanish |cite= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veto power reform ==
{{see also|Reform of the United Nations Security Council}}
Various discussions have taken place in recent years over the suitability of the Security Council veto power in today's world. Key arguments include that the five permanent members no longer represent the most stable and responsible member states in the United Nations, and that their veto power slows down and even prevents important decisions being made on matters of international peace and security. Due to the global changes that have taken place politically and economically since the formation of the UN in 1945, widespread debate has been apparent over whether the five permanent members of the UN Security Council remain the best member states to hold veto power. While some of the permanent members are still typically regarded as [[great powers]], there is debate over their suitability to retain exclusive veto power.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

A second argument against retaining the UNSC veto power is that it is detrimental to balanced political decisions, as any draft text needs to be approved of by each permanent member before any draft resolution can possibly be adopted. Indeed, several proposed draft resolutions are never formally presented to the Council for a vote owing to the knowledge that a permanent member would vote against their adoption (the so-called "pocket veto"). Debate also exists over the potential use of the veto power to provide "diplomatic cover" to a permanent member's allies {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. The United States has used its veto power more than any other permanent member since 1972, particularly on resolutions condemning the actions or policies of Israel.

Advocates of the veto power believe that it is just as necessary in the current geo-political landscape, and that without the veto power, the Security Council would be open to making democratic "majority rules" decisions on matters that have implications at a global level&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/schles.htm "Can the United Nations Reform"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906102312/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/schles.htm |date=6 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—decisions that may well go directly against the interests of a permanent member.

Discussions on improving the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include reform of the UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting the use of the veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; and abolishing the veto entirely. However, any reform of the veto will be very difficult, if not impossible. In fact, Articles 108 and 109 of the [[United Nations Charter]] grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold: it is highly unlikely that any of the P5 would accept a reform of the UN Charter that would be detrimental to their own national interests.

Nonetheless, it has been argued that with the adoption of the "[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Uniting for Peace]]" resolution by the General Assembly, and given the interpretations of the Assembly's powers that became [[customary international law]] as a result, that the Security Council "power of veto" problem could be surmounted.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, C. [http://zcomm.org/znetarticle/the-veto-charade-by-cameron-hunt/ "The 'veto' charade"], ZNet, 7 November 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its "primary responsibility" for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded "final responsibility"—rather than "secondary responsibility"—for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes;&lt;ref name="UN_A52856"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-52-856 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=52 |document_number=856| accessdate=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty.

Retrieved 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; thus rendering them little more than delays in UN action, should two-thirds of the Assembly subsequently agree that action is necessary.

The threat of the use of the veto by the P5 has led the UN Security Council to adopt what some commentators have described as unlawful resolutions that violated the UN Charter. For example, UNSC resolution 1422 of 2002, renewed once through resolution 1487 of 2003, aimed at exempting peace-keepers and other military personnel conducting operations authorised by the Security Council from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for a period of 12 months. Resolution 1422 was adopted as a consequence to the US veto on 30 June 2002 to the renewal of the Peace-keeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Party to the Rome Statute of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amicc.org/docs/PGA_1422ExpertOps.pdf Writings of Flavia Lattanzi, Kai Ambos and Claus Kress, inter alia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[common law]], a '''writ''' (Anglo-Saxon ''gewrit'', Latin ''breve'')&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg ed., ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial [[jurisdiction]]; in modern usage, this body is generally a [[court]]. [[Warrant (legal)|Warrants]], [[prerogative writ]]s, and [[subpoena]]s are common types of writ, but many forms exist and have existed.

In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English monarch to a specified person to undertake a specified action; for example, in the [[Feudalism in England|feudal era]] a military summons by the king to one of his [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] to appear dressed for battle with retinue at a certain place and time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Palgrave]] (1788-1861), ''Parliamentary Writs and Writs of Military Summons'' (2 volumes, 1827 and 1834)&lt;/ref&gt; An early usage survives in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] in a [[writ of election]], which is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and, in Australia, by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] for elections for the House of Representatives, or State Governors for State elections) to local officials ([[High Sheriff]]s of every county in the historical UK) to hold a [[general election]]. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; (then consisting primarily of the [[House of Lords]]) whose advice was considered valuable or who were particularly influential, and who were thereby deemed to have been created "[[Hereditary peer|barons by writ]]".

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Habeas corpus]] --&gt;

===Origins===
The writ was a unique development of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, and consisted of a brief administrative order, authenticated (innovatively) by a seal.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Written in the vernacular, they generally made a land grant, or conveyed instructions to a local court. In the beginning, writs were the document issued by the King's Chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the King about an injustice, after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; [[William the Conqueror]] took over the system unchanged, but was to extend it in two ways: first, writs became mainly framed in Latin, not Anglo-Saxon; second, they covered an increasing range of royal commands and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors, but it was not until [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs could take two main forms, open (patent) for all to read, and 'letters close' for one or more specified individuals alone.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

The development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of "off-the-shelf" justice designed to enable the English law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures. The complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer, which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions.  The development was part of the establishment of a [[Court of Common Pleas]], for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown, for example: "someone has damaged my property". The previous system of justice at the royal court of Chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming. Thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary, in most cases, to have a case heard in one of the Royal Courts, such as the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] or [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]]. Some franchise courts, especially in the [[County Palatine|Counties Palatine]], had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs. The writ was "served" on (delivered in person to) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ, or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient.

Where a [[plaintiff]] wished to have a case heard by a local court, or by an [[Eyre (legal term)|Eyre]] if one happened to be visiting the County, there would be no need to obtain a writ. Actions in local courts could usually be started by an informal complaint. However, if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of Royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the King's courts, then he would need a writ, a command of the King, to enable him to do this. Initially for [[common law]], recourse to the King's courts was unusual, and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay. For most Royal Courts, the writ would usually have been purchased from the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], although the court of the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]], being in essence another government department, was able to issue its own writs.

While originally writs were exceptional, or at least non-routine devices, [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] suggests that by the time of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154-1189), the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in England.

At first, new writs were drafted to fit each new situation, although in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, and in most cases limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court, often controlled by a lesser [[nobility|noble]], and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.

Over time, opposition to the creation of new writs by the Chancery increased. For example, in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as "novel, unheard of, and against reason" (Abbot of Lilleshall v Harcourt (1256) 96 SS xxix 44). Ultimately in 1258 the King was forced to accept the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which among other things, prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the [[Curia Regis|King's council]]. New writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of Parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static, each writ defining a particular [[form of action]]. It was the role and expertise of a [[solicitor]] to select on his client's behalf the appropriate writ for the proposed legal action. These were purchased from the court by payment of a fee. A [[barrister]] would then be hired by the solicitor to speak for his client in court.

=== Rationalisation of writs ===

With the abolition of the Forms of Action in 1832 and 1833, a profusion of writs was no longer needed, and one uniform writ came into use. After 1852 the need to state the name of the form of action was also abolished. In 1875 the form of writ was altered so that it conformed more to the [[subpoena]] used in the Chancery. A writ was a summons from the Crown, to the parties to the action, with on its back the substance of the action set out, together with a 'prayer' requesting a remedy from the court (for example damages). In 1980 the need for writs to be written in the name of the Crown was ended. From that time, a writ simply required the parties to appear..&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court (Writ and Appearance) 1979 (Statutory Instrument 1979, No. 1716)[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1979/1716/made], discussed in House of Lords in 1980,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1980/feb/07/rules-of-the-supreme-court-writ-and]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed  part of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]]. The procedure in a [[County Court]], which was established by statute, was to issue a 'summons'.

In 1999 the [[Woolf Reforms]] unified most of the procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court in civil matters. These reforms brought in the Civil Procedure Rules. Under these almost all civil actions, other than those connected with insolvency, are now commenced by the completion of a 'Claim Form' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'Writ', 'Originating Application', or 'Summons' (see Rules 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules).

==Writ of election==
In some [[Westminster system]]s, for example Canada and some other [[parliament]]ary systems, the phrase '[[dropping the writ]]' refers colloquially to a [[dissolution of parliament]] and the beginning of an [[election campaign]] to form a new one. This phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a [[writ of election]] must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the [[High Sheriff]]s of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections.

==United States law==
Early [[law of the United States]] inherited the traditional English writ system, in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law [[court]]s were authorized to grant. The [[All Writs Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizes [[United States federal courts]] to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." However, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], adopted in 1938 to govern [[civil procedure]] in the [[United States district court]]s, provide that there is only one [[form of action]] in civil cases, and explicitly abolish certain writs by name. Relief formerly available by a writ is now normally available by a [[lawsuit]] (civil action) or a [[motion (legal)|motion]] in a pending civil action. Nonetheless, a few writs have escaped abolition and remain in current use in the U.S. federal courts:

*The writ of [[habeas corpus]], usually used to test the legality of a prisoner's detention, has expressly been preserved. It is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution (Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the United States federal courts, the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by [[State court (United States)|state courts]]. The writ's application does not stop there: the Supreme Court has held the writ of habeas corpus open to all individuals held by the federal government, including Guantanamo Bay detainees. See [[Boumediene v. Bush]]. 
*By statute, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] uses the writ of [[certiorari]] to review cases from the United States courts of appeals or from the state courts.
*In extraordinary circumstances, the [[United States court of appeals]] can use the [[common law]] writ of [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] under the All Writs Act to control proceedings in the district courts.
*Some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case, a United States district court may use the common law writ of [[error coram nobis]] under the All Writs Act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available.
*The United States district courts normally follow state- in the United States federal courts but are almost never used in practice. In modern times, the All Writs Act is most commonly used as authority for federal courts to issue [[injunction]]s to protect their jurisdiction or effectuate their judgments.

The situation in the courts of the various [[U.S. state]]s varies from state to state but is often similar to that in the federal courts. Some states continue to use writ procedures, such as [[quo warranto]], that have been abolished as a procedural matter in federal courts.

In an attempt to purge [[Latin]] from the language of the law, [[California law]] has for many years used the term ''writ of mandate'' in place of ''writ of mandamus'', and ''writ of review'' in place of ''writ of certiorari''.

===Prerogative writs===
{{main article|Prerogative writ}}

The "prerogative" writs are a subset of the class of writs, those that are to be heard ahead of any other cases on a court's docket except other such writs. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''.

The due process for ''petitions for'' such writs is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of nonauthority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. In this they differ from a motion in a civil process in which the burden of proof is on the movant, and in which there can be a question of [[standing (law)|standing]].

===Other writs===
* A [[Attachment (law)|''writ of attachment'']] permits the arrest of a person or the seizure of private property.
* A [[Audita querela|''writ of audita querela'']] inhibits the unconscionable use of a lawful judgment because of matters arising subsequent to the judgment.
* A [[Capias|''writ of capias'']] directs an officer to take into custody the person named in the writ or order.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary of Terms", ''Shelby County Criminal Court Clerk'', s.v. "capias", retrieved on 30 Jun 2009: [http://www.co.shelby.tn.us/court_clerks/criminal_court/glossary.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[coram nobis|''writ of coram nobis'']] corrects a previous error "of the most fundamental character" to "achieve justice" where "no other remedy" is available, e.g., when a judgment was rendered without full knowledge of the facts.
* A [[elegit|''writ of elegit'']] orders the seizure of a portion of a debtor's lands and all his goods (except work animals) towards satisfying a creditor, until the debt is paid off.
* A ''writ of error'' is issued by an [[appeal|appellate court]], and directs a lower court of record to submit its record of the case laid for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;"Writ and Petition History System in Texas" [https://books.google.com/books?id=qB7k56Ufw_sC&amp;pg=PA90 page 90] ''In'' Quarles, Brandon D. and Cordon, Matthew C. (2003) ''Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner''&amp;nbsp; W.S. Hein, Buffalo, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-8377-3626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''writ of exigent'' (or ''exigend'') commands a sheriff to summon a defendant indicted for a felony, who had failed to appear in court, to deliver himself up upon pain of outlawry or forfeiture of his goods.
* A [[fieri facias|''writ of fieri facias'']] (colloquially "fi fa") commands a sheriff to take and auction off enough property from a losing party to pay the debt (plus interest and costs) owed by a judgment debtor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armstronglawyers.com.au/index.php?sectionID=6588&amp;pageID=6600 "Legal Terms", ''Armstrong Lawyers'', retrieved on 11 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[mittimus|''writ of mittimus'']] orders either (1) a court to send its record to another or (2) a jailor to receive the accused in his or her custody at any point during the investigative or trial process.
* A [[Ne exeat|''writ of ne exeat'']] restrains a defendant from fleeing the country or jurisdiction.
* A [[praemunire|''writ of praemunire'']] instructs a sheriff to order someone to appear in court to answer for any of a number of different crimes.
* A [[Scire facias|''writ of scire facias'']] revives a dormant judgment.
* A ''writ of supersedeas'' contains a command to stay the proceedings at law.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary of Terms", ''Colorado State Courts'', retrieved on 19 June 2009: [http://www.courts.state.co.us/Glossary.cfm].&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Venire facias de novo|''writ of venire facias'']] summons jurors to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;"Gloss...Terms", ''Shelby'' (op. cit.), s.v. "Venire facias".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian law ==
Under the [[India]]n legal system, jurisdiction to issue '[[prerogative writ]]s' is given to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], and to the High Courts of Judicature of all [[States of India|Indian states]]. Parts of the law relating to writs are set forth in the [[Constitution of India]]. The Supreme Court, the highest in the country, may issue writs under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and under Articles 139 for enforcement of rights other than Fundamental Rights, while High Courts, the superior courts of the States, may issue writs under Articles 226. '''&lt;u&gt;The Constitution broadly provides for five kinds of "prerogative" writs: ''habeas corpus'', ''certiorari'', ''mandamus'', ''quo warranto'' and prohibition.&lt;/u&gt;''' 

* The ''[[writ of prohibition]]'' is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court. Thus, the higher court transfers the case to itself.
* The ''[[writ of habeas corpus]]'' is issued to a detaining authority, ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court, along with the cause of his or her detention. If the detention is found to be illegal, the court issues an order to set the person free.
* The ''[[writ of certiorari]]'' is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review, together with all supporting files, evidence and documents, usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court. It is one of the mechanisms by which the [[Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of India|fundamental rights]] of the citizens are upheld.
* The ''[[writ of mandamus]]'' is issued to a subordinate court, an officer of government, or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties.
* The ''[[writ of quo warranto]]'' is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office. Through this writ the court inquires 'by what authority' the person supports his or her claim.
