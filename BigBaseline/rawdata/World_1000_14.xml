      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3455">The '''3 by 5 Initiative''' was an initiative of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to provide [[antiretroviral treatment]] to patients with [[HIV/AIDS]] in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name="who_main"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/3by5/en/ |title=The 3 by 5 Initiative |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program lasted from December 2003 to December 2005,&lt;ref name="eval"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/derec/canada/3by5-Evaluation-WHO.pdf |title=EVALUATION OF WHO’s CONTRIBUTION TO "3 BY 5": Main Report |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=2006 |author=Maria Ines Battistella Nemes |publisher=World Health Organization|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name "3 by 5" refers to the goal of treating 3 million people by 2005. The 3 by 5 Initiative is seen as the beginning of the scaling of antiretroviral treatments, and evaluations of the Initiative take this into account.&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;

==Strategy==

The 3 by 5 Initiative was guided by five "strategic pillars":&lt;ref name="making_it_happen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/3by5/publications/documents/en/3by5StrategyMakingItHappen.pdf |title=Treating 3 million by 2005: Making it happen - The WHO Strategy |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=2003 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* global leadership, strong partnership and advocacy
* urgent, sustained country support
* simplified, standardized tools for delivering antiretroviral therapy
* effective, reliable supply of medicines and diagnostics
* rapidly identifying and reapplying new knowledge and successes
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evaluation of the initiative==

An evaluation team commissioned by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and WHO reviewed the 3 by 5 initiative between July 2005 and March 2006. The evaluation team published their report in March 2006, titled ''Progress on global access to HIV antiretroviral therapy: a report on "3 by 5" and beyond''. It found that 1.3 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment in the target countries by December 2005, up from 400,000 before the start of the initiative. The evaluation team also found that many of the worst-affected countries were still far from containing their AIDS crises. It also credits the 3 by 5 Initiative with establishing antiretroviral treatment as an essential public health intervention.&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;{{rp|XIX–XX}}

The evaluation team attributes some of the difficulties in achieving the goals of the Initiative to an initial lack of secured funding (resulting in delays) and an unstable management of the HIV/AIDS program (due to the high turnover rate of WHO directors).&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;{{rp|XXIX}}

The 3 by 5 Initiative has been criticized by [[Arthur J. Ammann]] for focusing only on treatment of HIV (instead of also focusing on testing and prevention), for the high costs of the program, and for being "top down" instead of allowing target countries to take charge of their own AIDS programs.&lt;ref name="plos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010037 |title=Is the "3 by 5" Initiative the Best Approach to Tackling the HIV Pandemic? |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=November 30, 2004 |last1=Kim |first1=Jim Yong |first2=Arthur |last2=Ammann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brussels effect''' is the process of unilateral regulatory globalisation caused by the [[European Union]] [[de facto]] (but not necessarily [[de_jure|de jure]]) externalising its laws outside its borders through market mechanisms.

== Cause ==
The combination of market size, market importance&lt;ref name=Bradford2012&gt;Bradford, Anu (2012) ''The Brussels Effect.'' Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 107, No. 1, 2012; Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper No. 533. SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2770634 &lt;/ref&gt;, relatively stringent standards and regulatory capacity&lt;ref&gt;Bach, David and Newman, Abraham (2007) – ''The European regulatory state and global public policy: micro-institutions, macro-influence'' – Journal of European Public Policy https://doi.org/10.1080/13501760701497659&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Union can have the effect that firms trading internationally find that it is not economically, legally or technically practical to maintain lower standards in non-EU markets. Non-EU companies exporting globally can find that it is beneficial to adopt standards set in Brussels uniformly throughout their business.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe.'' Columbia Law School http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2013/january2013/brussels-effect&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal – ''Hot U.S. Import: European Regulations'' May 2018 https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-pickup-of-new-data-privacy-rules-reflects-eus-growing-influence-1525685400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The term Brussels effect was coined in 2012 by Professor Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School&lt;ref name=Bradford2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture, March 2012 - "''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe''" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the similar [[California effect]] that can be seen within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race to the top and race to the bottom ==
The [[California effect]] and the Brussels effect are a form of ‘race to the top’ where the most stringent standard has an appeal to companies operating across multiple regulatory environments as it makes global production and exports easier.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the ‘Brussels effect’ will undermine Brexit regulatory push'' July 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/fd5ca278-6654-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the whole world feels the ‘Brussels effect’'' November 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/7059dbf8-a82a-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Insights – ''Three Questions: Prof. David Bach on the Reach of European Privacy Regulations'' https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/three-questions-prof-david-bach-on-the-reach-of-european-privacy-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are the opposite of the ''Delaware effect'', a [[race to the bottom]] where jurisdictions can purposely choose to lower its regulatory requirements in an attempt to attract businesses looking for the least stringent standard. &lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=''Bloomberg View''|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Anti-trust===
The October 2000 $42 billion proposed acquisition of US-based Honeywell International by US-based General Electric was blocked by the EU antitrust authorities on the grounds of risking a horizontal monopoly in jet engines. The merger could not proceed because, despite the American Department of Justice having already approved the merger between these two US based entities, it was not legally possible to let the acquisition proceed in one important market, but not in another. &lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Case No COMP/M.2220 - General Electric/Honeywell http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_2220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
US-based multinational [[Dow Chemical]] announced in 2006 it would comply with the EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulation for the production and use of chemical substances across its global operation.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dow and REACH - Protecting human health and the environment https://reach.dow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reach External FAQs https://consumer.dow.com/en-us/technical-support/ehs-portal/reach-external-faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplane emissions===
In 2012 the EU included aviation into its existing [[European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]]. This means that any airline, regardless of their country of origin, has to purchase emissions permits for any flights within the [[European_Economic_Area|European Economic Area]]. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Reducing emissions from aviation https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of complying with EU aviation emission regulation puts pressure on manufacturers to design airplanes with improved efficiency and reduced emissions. As major airlines would not likely purchase airplanes specifically to fly outside the EEA, the EU’s stricter aviation standards have an impact on global airplane fleets, regardless of the jurisdiction of the airline.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;

===Data protection and privacy===
With the introduction of the[[Data_Protection_Directive | Data Protection Directive]] in 1995 the EU had opted for a strict top-down approach to data privacy. &lt;ref&gt;Gady, Franz-Stefan (2014) EU/U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy and the "Brussels Effect": A Comparative Analysis https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773645&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), was adopted on 14 April 2016 and had a global effect &lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Information wars: How Europe became the world’s data police'' May 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/1aa9b0fa-5786-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development – ''Europe’s Data Privacy Rules Set New Global Approach to Consumer Rights'' May 2018 https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/europe%e2%80%99s-data-privacy-rules-set-new-global-approach-to-consumer-rights&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, during negotiations for a new Japan-EU trade deal, Japan set up an independent agency to handle privacy complaints to conform with the EU's new privacy regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Politico.EU – ''Europe’s new data protection rules export privacy standards worldwide'' January 2018 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-data-protection-privacy-standards-gdpr-general-protection-data-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;
Facebook announced in April 2018 that it would implement parts of the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;Facebook's commitment to data protection and privacy in compliance with the GDPR https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebooks-commitment-to-data-protection-and-privacy-in-compliance-with-the-gdpr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complying With New Privacy Laws and Offering New Privacy Protections to Everyone, No Matter Where You Live https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/&lt;/ref&gt;, Sonos announced in April 2018 that it would implement the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;We’re Updating the Sonos Privacy Statement https://blog.sonos.com/en-gb/updating-sonos-privacy-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft announced in May 2018 that it would implement GDPR compliance for all its customers globally.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to GDPR, privacy and putting customers in control of their own data https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/21/microsofts-commitment-to-gdpr-privacy-and-putting-customers-in-control-of-their-own-data/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Citizenfour''''' is a 2014 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Laura Poitras]], concerning [[Edward Snowden]] and the [[NSA spying scandal]]. The film had its US premiere on October 10, 2014, at the [[New York Film Festival]] and its UK premiere on October 17, 2014, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]]. The film features Snowden and [[Glenn Greenwald]], and was co-produced by Poitras, [[Mathilde Bonnefoy]], and [[Dirk Wilutzky]], with [[Steven Soderbergh]] and others serving as [[executive producer]]s. ''Citizenfour'' received critical acclaim upon release, and was the recipient of numerous accolades, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[87th Academy Awards|2015 Oscars]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:CITIZENFOUR (2014) trailer.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:05|Shot from the film trailer for ''Citizenfour'']]
In January 2013, [[Laura Poitras]], an American documentary film director/producer who had been working for several years on a film about monitoring programs in the United States that were the result of the [[September 11 attacks]], receives an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who calls himself, "Citizenfour."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/snowdens-first-emails-to-poitras/|title=These Are the Emails Snowden Sent to First Introduce His Epic NSA Leaks|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers her inside information about illegal [[wiretapping]] practices of the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, accompanied by investigative journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' intelligence reporter [[Ewen MacAskill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview|title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light|author1=Suzanna Andrews|author2=Bryan Burrough|author3=Sarah Ellison|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she travels to Hong Kong with her camera for the first meeting with the stranger in a hotel, who reveals himself as [[Edward Snowden]]. Scenes of their meeting take place in Snowden's hotel room, where he maintains his privacy. Shots of Snowden in his bed, in front of his mirror and of the hotel from a distance  form the character of Snowden as a trapped political agent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keenan, “Windows: of Vulnerability,” Ed. Bruce Robbins, The Phantom Public Sphere (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,1997), 121-141&lt;/ref&gt;

After four days of interviews, on June 9, Snowden's identity is made public at his request. As media outlets begin to discover his location at [[The Mira Hong Kong]], Snowden relocates to Poitras' room in an attempt to elude phone calls made to his room. Facing potential extradition and prosecution in the United States, Snowden schedules a meeting with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and applies for refugee status. After Poitras believes she is being followed, she leaves Hong Kong for Berlin.

On June 21, the US government requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. Snowden manages to depart from Hong Kong, but his US passport is cancelled before he can connect to Havana, stranding him in the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in Moscow. On August 1, 2013, the Russian government grants Snowden temporary asylum for a period of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chumley|first1=Cheryl|last2=Sherfinski|first2=David|title=Edward Snowden granted asylum in Russia, leaves airport|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/1/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-granted-asylum-ru/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Greenwald returns to his home in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and speaks publicly about United States' utilization of NSA programs for foreign surveillance. Greenwald and Poitras maintain a correspondence wherein they both express reluctance to return to the United States.

Throughout, the film offers smaller vignettes that precede and follow Snowden's Hong Kong interviews, including [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] speaking about NSA programs, and eventually testifying before the German Parliament regarding [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA spying in Germany.]]

The film closes with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting once again, this time in Russia. Greenwald and Snowden discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful to only write down and not speak critical pieces of information. Greenwald tears these documents creating a pile of scraps, before slowly removing them from the table.

== Background on Snowden ==
[[File:Edward Snowden 2013-10-9 (1) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Edward Snowden, October 2013.]]
Born on June 21, 1983 in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]], Edward Snowden first became involved with the United States government upon his enrollment in the [[Army Reserves]] in the spring of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/edward-snowden-21262897|title=Edward Snowden|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden claims to have left the program after a few months because he broke his legs in a training accident while a US House of Representatives report claims he had shin splints&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Executive Summary of Review of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|year=2016|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He then began working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 2006 and was stationed with diplomatic cover by agency in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]] in 2007. After nearly three years with the agency, Snowden resigned his position in February 2009 in order to begin working for a contractor for the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]. It was at this point in his career that Snowden could sense that his views were changing; "I watched as Obama advanced the very policies that I thought would be reigned in ... [The NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of behaviour in the world known to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/edward-snowden-intelligence-leak-nsa-contractor-extract|title=How Edward Snowden went from loyal NSA contractor to whistleblower|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2014-02-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Snowden was reassigned from his base in Japan to a base in Honolulu, Hawaii, working for a variety of different contractors before serving as a consultant to [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/edward-snowden-timeline-n114871|title=Edward Snowden: A Timeline - NBC News|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In his own words, the longer he continued to work for the NSA, the more he "worked in secret to resist" his own feelings regarding the various programs in place at the agency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/edward-snowden-says-motive-behind-leaks-was-to-expose-surveillance-state/2013/06/09/aa3f0804-d13b-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html|title=Edward Snowden says motive behind leaks was to expose ‘surveillance state’|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He had served at the Hawaiian base for approximately 15 months prior to leaving the United States and leaking thousands of classified documents. 

==Production==
By 2012, Poitras had begun work on the third film in her 9/11 trilogy, which she intended to focus broadly on the topic of domestic [[surveillance]] for which she interviewed Assange, Greenwald, Binney, and Appelbaum.&lt;ref name="Packer 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Packer|first1=George|authorlink1=George Packer|title=Laura Poitras's closeup view of Edward Snowden.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/holder-secrets|accessdate=December 12, 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was first contacted by Snowden in January 2013 after he was unable to establish encrypted communications with Greenwald.&lt;ref name="Lapin 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lapin|first1=Andrew |title='Citizenfour' Follows The Snowden Story Without (Much) Grandstanding |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/24/356100779/citizenfour-follows-the-snowden-story-without-much-grandstanding|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=December 12, 2014|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/excerpt-glenn-greenwalds-no-place-to-hide/ |title=Excerpt: Glenn Greenwald's 'No Place to Hide'|first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |publisher=ABC News}} {{Dead link |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She flew to Hong Kong in late May 2013, where over the course of eight days she filmed Snowden in his hotel room&lt;ref name="Packer 2014"/&gt; at the [[The Mira Hong Kong|Mira Hotel]] in Hong Kong.

Ronnie Scheib of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "No amount of familiarity with whistleblower Edward Snowden and his shocking revelations of the U.S. government's wholesale spying on its own citizens can prepare one for the impact of Laura Poitras's extraordinary documentary ''Citizenfour''... far from reconstructing or analyzing a fait accompli, the film tersely records the deed in real time, as Poitras and fellow journalist Glenn Greenwald meet Snowden over an eight-day period in a Hong Kong hotel room to plot how and when they will unleash the bombshell that shook the world. Adapting the cold language of data encryption to recount a dramatic saga of abuse of power and justified paranoia, Poitras brilliantly demonstrates that information is a weapon that cuts both ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-citizenfour-1201327600/

Spencer Ackerman writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "''Citizenfour'' must have been a maddening documentary to film. Its subject is pervasive global surveillance, an enveloping digital act that spreads without visibility, so its scenes unfold in courtrooms, hearing chambers and hotels. Yet the virtuosity of Laura Poitras, its director and architect, makes its 114 minutes crackle with the nervous energy of revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/11/citizenfour-review-snowden-vindicated-poitras-nsa-journalism | title=''Citizenfour'' Review&amp;nbsp;– Poitras' Victorious Film Shows Snowden Vindicated | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=October 11, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2014 | last=Ackerman | first=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In December 2014, retired naval officer and oil executive Horace Edwards of Kansas filed suit against the film's producers "on behalf of the American people" for aiding and abetting Snowden's leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Academy rejected the claim, noting that "the ''Guardian'' interview appears in less than two minutes of the documentary", and ruled that ''Citizenfour'' was eligible for Oscar consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-rejects-challenge-citizenfour-oscar-759987 |title=Academy Rejects Challenge to ''Citizenfour'' Oscar Eligibility |first=Scott|last=Feinberg |date=December 23, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the filmmakers asked the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas]] to dismiss the lawsuit on standing and jurisdictional grounds, and on [[First Amendment]] grounds citing ''[[Bartnicki v. Vopper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/citizenfour-filmmakers-demand-end-lawsuit-772519|title='Citizenfour' Filmmakers Demand End to Lawsuit Over Edward Snowden Disclosures

Poitras also received several journalistic and humanitarian awards for reporting the Snowden disclosures depicted in the film, including the [[George Polk award]] (with Greenwald and MacAskill),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 GEORGE POLK AWARD WINNERS|url=http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Polk/Previous.aspx#2013|publisher=Long Island University|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize]] (with Edward Snowden)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridenhour.org/prizes_truth-telling_2014b.html|title=The Ridenhour Prizes – Fostering the spirit of courage and truth|author=Ridenhour Prizes|publisher=Ridenhour.org|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Carl von Ossietzky]] medal for [[human rights]] (with Greenwald and Snowden),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ilmr.de/2014/english-material-invitation-for-the-ceremonial-act-carl-von-ossietzky-medal-2014-sunday-dec-14th-11-h-urania-berlin|title=English Material: Invitation for the Ceremonial act Carl-von-Ossietzky-Medal 2014|publisher=Internationale Liga für Menschenrechte (International league for human rights)|date=December 10, 2014|place=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Henri Nannen Prize]] for Efforts for Independence of the Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bertelsmann.com/corporate-responsibility/projects/project/henri-nannen-award-for-efforts-for-independence-of-the-press.jsp|title = Henri Nannen Award for Efforts for Independence of the Press|date = May 8, 2014|accessdate = June 7, 2014|website = Bertelsmann.com|publisher = Bertelsmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for reporting by Poitras, Greenwald, MacAskill, and [[Barton Gellman]].&lt;ref name="pulitzer prize"&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/14/guardian-washington-post-pulitzer-nsa-revelations | title=Guardian and Washington Post win Pulitzer prize for NSA revelations|work=The Guardian| date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
{{NSA surveillance|1|2|3}}
Poitras took many security precautions related to the film, described by military writer [[Peter Maass]] among others.&lt;ref name=maass&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html|first=Peter|last=Maass|title=How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets |work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/09/berlins-digital-exiles-tech-activists-escape-nsa |first=Carole|last=Cadwalladr|title=Berlin's digital exiles: where tech activists go to escape the NSA|date=November 9, 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being detained repeatedly at border controls when entering the US.&lt;ref name=maass/&gt; She edited the film in Germany after flying directly there from Hong Kong with the Snowden footage, to prevent the FBI from showing up with a search warrant for her hard drives. All the film footage is kept on encrypted drives with multiple levels of nested protection.&lt;ref name="wired-crypto"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/laura-poitras-crypto-tools-made-snowden-film-possible/ |title=Laura Poitras on the Crypto Tools That Made Her Snowden Film Possible|first=Andy|last=Greenberg
|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer she uses for reading sensitive documents is separated from the internet by an [[air gap (networking)|air gap]]. Greenwald credited her with a "complete expert level of understanding of how to do a story like this with total technical and operational safety". Maass called Poitras' security skills "particularly vital — and far from the journalistic norm — in an era of pervasive government spying", and quotes Snowden stating that "[i]n the wake of this year's disclosure, it should be clear that unencrypted journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless."&lt;ref name=maass/&gt;

Bonnefoy has also discussed the encrypted workflow used in making the film, adding "if we have a conversation that's particularly confidential, we'll move the electronics out of the room, or we'll just meet somewhere outside of the editing room, without our phones."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/88016-positive-trauma-editor-mathilde-bonnefoy-on-citizenfour/ |title=Positive Trauma: Editor Mathilde Bonnefoy on CITIZENFOUR|work=[[Filmmaker magazine]] |first=Scott|last=Macaulay|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] (which selects films for the New York Film Festival) reported&lt;ref name=nyff2&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/silent-no-more-laura-poitras-talks-about-citizenfour|title=Silent No More, Laura Poitras Talks About 'CITIZENFOUR'|first=Eugene|last=Hernandez |date=October 14, 2014|publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Poitras changed the location of the initial screening for the NYFF's selection committee several times, in case someone was tracking her movements. The committee was shown a rough cut that had sensitive material redacted, and the NYFF "had to keep the movie's inclusion in the festival under wraps until mid-September" and it was "kept out of festival schedules and documents until we could talk about it openly". The last-minute inclusion in the festival's main slate was an unprecedented event for the NYFF,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/edward-snowden-doc-added-new-733161|title=New York Film Fest: Top-Secret Edward Snowden Doc Added to Lineup |first=Scott|last=Feinberg|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "tickets for both screenings sold out within just a few hours".&lt;ref name=nyff2/&gt;

The film's ending credits unusually&lt;ref name="wired-crypto"/&gt; name several [[free software]] projects and security tools, without which "this film would not be possible". The programs named include [[Tor (software)|Tor]], [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]], [[Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging]], the [[GNU Privacy Guard]], [[Truecrypt]], and [[SecureDrop]]. In October 2014, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] published an informational page about the software credited in the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/7-privacy-tools-essential-making-citizenfour|title=The 7 Privacy Tools Essential to Making Snowden Documentary CITIZENFOUR|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|first=Parker|last=Higgins|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 2015 Poitras was prominently featured in a Tor fund-raising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-laura-poitras|title=This is what a Tor Supporter looks like: Laura Poitras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of prominent figures===
:[[Garry Davis]] (Peace activist who created the first "World Passport)
:[[Albert Einstein]] ("The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people.")
:[[George Monbiot]] ("A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves")&lt;ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs), both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease (YLDs). One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kay00"&gt;{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |booktitle=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; The report found that approximately one fourth of the global disease burden and more than one third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".&lt;ref name="whatisenv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
*Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
*[[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
*[[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
*[[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
*[[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
*[[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
*Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands&lt;ref name="whatisenv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
*Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
*Lead
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name="oberg10"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|year=2010|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural climate change (as opposed to man-made climate change)
*Occupational [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate]]s or [[carcinogen]]s
*Outdoor air pollution
*[[Sanitation]] and hygiene problems
*[[Second-hand smoke]]
*Solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quantification" /&gt;

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.&lt;ref name="knol05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt; Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt; For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fewtrell07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.&lt;ref name="kay00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt; When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.&lt;ref name="knol09" /&gt;

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.&lt;ref name="knol05" /&gt;

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to the Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.&lt;ref name="wigmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="wigmore" /&gt;

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need).  The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values.  Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dispatches''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio program, which aired on [[CBC Radio One]] from 2001 to 2012. The program, which was hosted by [[Rick MacInnes-Rae]], aired [[radio documentary|documentary]] reports on international news and feature topics.&lt;ref name=goodbye&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rick-macinnes-rae-says-goodbye-1.2711684 "Rick MacInnes-Rae says goodbye"]. [[CBC News]], July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening music was an excerpt from [[Mark Knopfler]]'s song "[[What It Is (Mark Knopfler song)|What It Is]]." 

Originally a half-hour program, the program expanded to a one-hour format in April 2007, incorporating some features of CBC Radio's cancelled [[world music]] series ''[[Global Village (radio show)|Global Village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"CBC changes format of Radio Two". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2012, the CBC announced it would cancel the program as part of its budget cuts as a result of the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Duga''' ({{lang-rus|Дуга}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet [[missile defense]] [[early-warning radar]] network. The system operated from July 1976 to December 1989. Two operational Duga radars were deployed, one near [[Chernobyl]] and [[Chernihiv]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]), the other in eastern [[Siberia]].

The Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] in some cases, and broadcast in the [[shortwave radio]] bands. They appeared without warning, sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The "Russian" (sic) Woodpecker... A Closer Look | author = David L. Wilson | journal= Monitoring Times | date = Summer 1985 | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker5.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the '''Russian Woodpecker'''. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, [[amateur radio]] operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs in an effort to filter out the interference.

The unclaimed signal was a source for much speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet [[mind control]] and [[weather control]] experiments. However, because of its distinctive transmission pattern, many experts and amateur radio hobbyists quickly realized it to be an over-the-horizon radar system.  [[NATO]] [[military intelligence]] had already given it the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] ''STEEL WORK'' or ''STEEL YARD''. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, this theory was not publicly confirmed until after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

== History ==

===Genesis===
The Soviets had been working on [[early warning radar]] for their [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning [[satellite]] network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.

The first experimental system, Duga, was built outside [[Mykolaiv]] in [[Ukraine]], successfully detecting rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 2,500 kilometers. This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="PodvigBook"&gt;{{Cite book

==="Russian Woodpecker"===
At some point in 1976, a new and powerful radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed 'the Woodpecker' by [[amateur radio]] operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this "the Russian Woodpecker". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but is probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.

[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and NATO quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being alternately located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

The radar system was given the code 5Н32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to civilian observers at the time, [[NATO]] was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.

===NATO Reporting Name===
The NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any "official" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, deconflicting this will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.&lt;ref name="The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition"&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Civilian identification===
Even from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests
 | journal= Wireless World
 | pages = 53
 | date = February 1977
 | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker2.html
 | accessdate = 2007-06-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.

As more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Letter from J. P. Martinez
 | author =  J.P. Martinez
 | journal= Wireless World

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence is usable for a 100&amp;nbsp;μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) (the distance light travels in 50&amp;nbsp;μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.

In 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&amp;nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&amp;nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.
* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* The most common rate was 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, while the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.
* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===Jamming the Woodpecker===
[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]

To combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core group members would frame the "Official Practice Target" in their radio shacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
Starting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.

According to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands, however, and has been used by amateurs as a transmission tower (using their own antennas) and has been extensively photographed.

The original Duga was the first experimental system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A. Karpenko Nevsky Bastion|volume=No. 4|year=1999|pages=2–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built outside the Black Sea port of [[Mykolaiv]] in the southern [[Ukraine]], and successfully detected rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] about 2,500 kilometers away. Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire which seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.

The original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2, with the receiver at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} located a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. 

Duga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&amp;nbsp;km north of the city.

== Appearances in media ==
The Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game heavily features actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.

[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].

In ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map "Grid" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.

In the movie ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', the fence around Chicago is derived from photographs of the Duga-1 array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.qrz.com/showthread.php?430504-The-quot-Woodpecker-quot-moves-to-fururistic-Chicago!

The 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.

The Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.

Originally, ''earth'' was written in lowercase, and from [[early Middle English]], its [[definite]] sense as "the globe" was expressed as ''[[definite article|the]] earth''. By [[Early Modern English]], many nouns were capitalized, and ''the earth'' became (and often remained) ''the Earth'', particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as ''Earth'', by analogy with the names of the [[Solar System|other planets]].&lt;ref name=oedearth/&gt; [[Style guide|House styles]] now vary: [[Oxford spelling]] recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by ''the'' (e.g. "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''The New Oxford Dictionary of English'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "earth".

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}. The last continental glaciation ended {{val|10000|u=years|fmt=commas}} ago.&lt;ref name=psc/&gt;

A half billion years later, the [[last universal common ancestor|last common ancestor of all current life]] arose.&lt;ref name=sa282_6_90/&gt; The evolution of [[photosynthesis]] allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

{{Main|Figure of the Earth|Earth radius}}
The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

[[erosion and tectonics|Tectonics and erosion]], [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[flooding]], [[weathering]], [[glaciation]], the growth of [[coral reef]]s, and [[Impact event|meteorite impacts]] are among the processes that constantly reshape the Earth's surface over [[geological time]].&lt;ref name=kring/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth's Evolving Systems: The History of Planet Earth |first=Ronald |last=Martin |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agaOKrvAoeAC |isbn=978-0-7637-8001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=layers_earth/&gt; [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.&lt;ref name=jessey/&gt; The third form of rock material found on Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant [[silicate mineral]]s on Earth's surface include [[quartz]], [[feldspar]]s, [[amphibole]], [[mica]], [[pyroxene]] and [[olivine]].&lt;ref name=de_pater_lissauer2010/&gt; Common [[carbonate mineral]]s include [[calcite]] (found in [[limestone]]) and [[dolomite]].&lt;ref name=wekn_bulakh2004/&gt;

The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of {{convert|-418|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the [[Dead Sea]], to a maximum altitude of {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about {{convert|797|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo1_surface_histogram.html |title=Hypsographic Curve of Earth's Surface from ETOPO1 |first=National Geophysical Data |last=Center |website=ngdc.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrosphere===
{{Main|Hydrosphere}}
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|Elevation histogram of Earth's surface]]
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=Gya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] and, indirectly, the formation of the [[ozone layer]] due to the subsequent [[Ozone–oxygen cycle|conversion of atmospheric {{chem2|O2}} into {{chem2|O3}}]]. The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

===Gravitational field===

[[File:Geoids sm.jpg|thumb|Earth's gravity measured by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] mission, showing deviations from the [[theoretical gravity]]. Red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue shows where it is weaker.]]
The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. B. |last1=Watts |first2=S.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

====Magnetosphere====

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?  This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet.

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] used [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and [[Radiometric dating|radioactive dating]] were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Equation for Every Occasion: Fifty-Two Formulas and Why They Matter |last=Henshaw |first=John M. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-421-41491-1 |location= |pages=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth |last=Burchfield |first=Joe D. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 |location= |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/06/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-space-matters-watch/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Why Space Matters |work=[[The Alcalde]] |first=Rose |last=Cahalan |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=hill_radius&gt;For Earth, the [[Hill radius]] is &lt;math&gt;R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass of Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sidereal_solar&gt;The number of solar days in a year is one less than the number of [[sidereal day]]s (the time it takes the Earth to revolve exactly 360 degrees around its axis) because a solar day is about 236 seconds longer than a sidereal day. Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another. A number of potential Gaian feedback mechanisms have been proposed—such as the [[CLAW hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Snowden asylum in Russia''' is part of the aftermath from the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] made by [[Edward Snowden]]. On June 23, 2013, Snowden flew from Hong Kong to Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Noting that his U.S. passport had been cancelled, Russian authorities restricted him to the airport terminal. On August 1, after 39 days in the transit section, Snowden left the airport. He was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year. On August 7, 2014, six days after Snowden's one-year temporary asylum expired, his Russian lawyer announced that Snowden had received a three-year residency permit. It allowed him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. Snowden was not granted permanent political asylum, which would require a separate process.

===First contact and sequestered in the airport===
Russia first received information about Snowden when he was in Hong Kong China. At that time, they were told that a person who wanted to fight against human right violations wanted to seek asylum in Russia. In 2017, during ''[[The Putin Interviews]]'' with the Director [[Oliver Stone]], the Russian president Vladimir Putin described how Russia got involved in the Snowden saga. During that time, Rusisia did not want to get involved as it already had a strained relationship with the United states which it did not wish to exacerbate. Thereafter they learnt that Snowden was on a plane bound for Moscow, to transfer to another plane bound for Latin America. Most of this information was received through informal channels including information leaded to the press. While he was int he plane, his destination countries grew reluctant to allow him in, and Snowden was thus stuck in the transit area of [[Moscow Airport|Moscow international airport]]. While in the airport, U.S.authorities asked Russia to extradite Snowden. However this was not possible as Russia had proposed a treaty on cooperation  in legal matters, requiring mutual extradition of criminals, which U.S.  had not agreed upon. Further, United States had never extradited any Russian criminal who had taken asylum in USA, hence Snowden's extradition would have been unprecedented. Snowden had not committed a crime as per Russian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 - 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=www.sho.com |publisher=Showtime |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2013, Lonnie Snowden said he believed his son would be better off staying in Russia, and didn't believe he would receive a fair trial in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/27/nsa-snowden-father-justice-russia Edward Snowden better off in Russia than US, his father says]." [[Associated Press]] at ''The Guardian''. July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October, he visited his son in Moscow, later telling the press that he was pleased with Edward's situation, and still believed Russia was the best choice for his asylum, saying he wouldn't have to worry about people "rushing across the border to render him." Lonnie Snowden commented that his son was living comfortably in Russia and found Moscow "modern and sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/world/europe/russia-snowden-dad/ Edward Snowden's father pleased with son's Moscow life]. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, announced on October 31 that his client had found a website maintenance job at one of Russia's largest websites, but declined to identify the site. Jesselyn Radack, one of Snowden's American lawyers, said she was unaware of any new job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/nsa-leaker-edward-snowden-job-russia/story?id=20739729 |title=NSA Leaker Edward Snowden Has New Job in Russia, Lawyer Says |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about this by ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' in June 2014, ''The Guardian'' correspondent [[Luke Harding]] replied, "Kucherena is completely unreliable as a source. We [''The Guardian''] did the rounds of Russian IT companies when he made that claim last year and none of them—none of the big ones, at least—confirmed this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/art_n_ideas/article/snowden-book-and-upcoming-film-chronicle-exile/501753.html |title=Snowden Book and Upcoming Film Chronicle Exile |newspaper=The Moscow Times |date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA analyst [[Ray McGovern]], who had traveled to Russia to give Snowden a whistleblower award, said that Snowden gave no storage devices such as [[hard drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s to Russia or China, and had carried four blank laptops with him to Hong Kong and Moscow as a diversion. U.S. officials said they assumed that any classified materials downloaded by Snowden had fallen into the hands of China and Russia, though they acknowledged they had no proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/11/us-usa-security-snowden-idUSBRE99A0LK20131011 |title=Laptops Snowden took to Hong Kong, Russia were a 'diversion' |last=Hosenball |first=Mark |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2013 interview, Snowden maintained that he did not bring any classified material into Russia "because it wouldn't serve the public interest." He added, "There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents."&lt;ref name=Risen&gt;{{cite news |last=Risen |first=James |title=Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took-no-secret-files-to-russia.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, however, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that British government officials anonymously claimed to the paper that Russia and China had cracked an encrypted cache of files taken by Snowden, forcing the withdrawal of British spies from live operations.&lt;ref name="ST 14/06/15"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1568673.ece |title=British spies betrayed to Russians and Chinese |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=June 14, 2015 |first1=Tom |last1=Harper |first2=Richard |last2=Kerbaj |first3=Tim |last3=Shipman}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also stated that their sources told them British intelligence assets had been moved as a precaution after the Snowden leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British spies 'moved after Snowden files read' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33125068 |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |work=BBC |date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Greenwald charged that the report contained fabrications and did nothing more than quote anonymous British officials; he said parts were removed from the original post without ''The Times'' saying it did so.&lt;ref name=GreenwaldInterceptSundayTimesReport&gt;{{cite news |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn |title=The Sunday Times' Snowden Story is Journalism at its Worst — and Filled with Falsehoods |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/14/sunday-times-report-snowden-files-journalism-worst-also-filled-falsehoods/ |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Snowden speaks about everything.webm|right|thumb|Edward Snowden speaks about various topics at the [[Sam Adams Award]] presentation in Moscow.]]
WikiLeaks released video of Snowden on October 11 taken during the [[Sam Adams Award]] reception in Moscow, his first public appearance in three months. Former U.S. government officials attending the ceremony said they saw no evidence Snowden was under the control of Russian security services. The whistleblower group said he was in good spirits, looked well, and still believes he was right to release the NSA documents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/1010/Edward-Snowden-back-in-the-limelight-Father-US-whistleblowers-visit-Moscow-video Edward Snowden back in the limelight?

(October 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Snowden said "people all over the world are coming to realize" that the NSA's surveillance programs put people in danger, hurt the U.S. and its economy, and "limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and associate freely" as well as putting people "at risk of coming into conflict with our own government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |title=Edward Snowden says NSA surveillance programmes 'hurt our country' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/edward-snowden-nsa-surveillance-wikileaks-videos |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, German lawmaker [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]] traveled to Moscow to meet with Snowden, whom he invited to testify before the German parliament to assist investigations into NSA surveillance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s phone since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/27/obama-knew-nsa-spying-on-merkel-and-approved-it-report-says-944692234/ Obama knew of NSA spying on Merkel and approved it, report says].

Also in October, Glenn Greenwald stated that the U.S. revoked Snowden's passport while he was in transit to Latin America and threatened other countries that might offer safe passage.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Natasha.

On December 17, 2013, Snowden wrote an open letter to the people of Brazil offering to assist the Brazilian government in investigating allegations of U.S. spying, and added that he continued to seek, and would require, asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowdens-open-letter-to-brazil-read-the-text/2013/12/17/9bf1342a-6727-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html |title=Snowden's open letter to Brazil: Read the text |work=The Washington Post |date=December 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden wrote, "Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak ... going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/world/americas/snowden-nsa-brazil-letter/ |title=Snowden's open letter offers to help Brazil look into NSA surveillance |publisher=CNN |date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil had been in an uproar since Snowden revealed that the U.S. was spying on Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]], her senior advisors, and Brazil's national oil company, [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/world/americas/brazil-nsa/ |title=As Brazil's fury over NSA mounts, U.S. vows to work through tensions |publisher=CNN |date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseff and officials of the Brazilian foreign ministry said in response that they could not consider asylum for Snowden because they had not received any formal request.&lt;ref name=reutersbrazil121713&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/17/us-usa-security-snowden-brazil-idUSBRE9BG15920131217 |title=Brazil says not considering Snowden asylum |agency=Reuters |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the foreign ministry said that a fax requesting asylum had been sent to the Brazilian embassy in Moscow in July but it had not been signed and could not be authenticated.&lt;ref name=BrazilianSenator&gt;{{cite news |title=Brazilian Senator Urges Asylum For Snowden |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/brazilian-senator-urges-asylum-snowden |date=December 18, 2013 |work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Miranda, the Brazilian partner of Glenn Greenwald, launched an Internet petition urging the Brazilian president to consider offering Snowden asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-says-it-is-not-considering-asylum-for-edward-snowden/ |title=Brazil says it is not considering asylum for Edward Snowden |publisher=CBS News |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden met with Barton Gellman of ''The Washington Post'' six months after the disclosure for an exclusive interview spanning 14 hours, his first since being granted temporary asylum. Snowden talked about his life in Russia as "an indoor cat," reflected on his time as an NSA contractor, and discussed at length the revelations of global surveillance and their reverberations. Snowden said, "In terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished ... I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated."&lt;ref name="WPSnowdenInterview20131224"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gellmann |first=Barton |title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission's accomplished |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html |accessdate=January 4, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented "I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA ... I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it." On the accusation from former CIA and NSA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] that he had defected, Snowden stated, "If I defected at all, I defected from the government to the public."&lt;ref name="WPSnowdenInterview20131224" /&gt; In 2014, Snowden said that he lives "a surprisingly open life" in Russia and that he is recognized when he goes to computer stores.&lt;ref name="Globo"&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2014/06/se-o-brasil-me-oferecer-asilo-aceito-diz-edward-snowden.html 'Se o Brasil me oferecer asilo, aceito', diz Edward Snowden] ''[[Rede Globo]]'' June 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[BuzzFeed]], in January 2014 an anonymous Pentagon official said he wanted to kill Snowden. "I would love to put a bullet in his head," said the official, calling Snowden "single-handedly the greatest traitor in American history." Members of the intelligence community also expressed their violent hostility. "In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American," said an NSA analyst, "I personally would go and kill him myself."&lt;ref name=Buzzfeed&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Benny |title=America's Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/americas-spies-want-edward-snowden-dead |work=Buzzfeed |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department spokesperson condemned the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/snowden-seeking-russian-protection-after-threats-lawyer |title=Snowden Seeking Russian Protection After Threats: Lawyer |publisher=[[Bloomberg Technology]] |date=January 21, 2014 |first=Ilya |last=Arkhipov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Meet the Press]]'' in late January 2014, speculation arose from top U.S. officials in the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that Snowden might have been assisted by Russian intelligence,&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=David |title=January 19: Dianne Feinstein, Mike Rogers, Alexis Ohanian, John Wisniewski, Rudy Giuliani, Robert Gates, Newt Gingrich, Andrea Mitchell, Harold Ford Jr., Nia-Malika Henderson |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/54117257/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/january-dianne-feinstein-mike-rogers-alexis-ohanian-john-wisniewski-rudy-giuliani-robert-gates-newt-gingrich-andrea-mitchell-harold-ford-jr-nia-malika-henderson/#.UuCqh_ZMFFR |work=Meet The Press |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting a rare interview during which Snowden spoke in his defense.

In late January 2014, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. attorney general]] [[Eric Holder]], in an interview with [[MSNBC]], indicated that the U.S. could allow Snowden to return from Russia under negotiated terms, saying he was prepared to engage in conversation with him, but that full [[clemency]] would be going too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia |title=US hints at Edward Snowden plea bargain to allow return from Russia |date=January 23, 2014 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, he appeared on video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q&amp;A exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications.

[[ACLU]] attorney [[Ben Wizner]], one of Snowden's closest advisers, told the ''Beast'' that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. "I know this is hard to believe," Wizner acknowledged. "I know if I was just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast2"&gt;Noah Shachtman (April 20, 2014), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/20/snowden-s-camp-staged-putin-q-a-was-a-screw-up.html Snowden's Camp: Staged Putin Q&amp;A Was a Screw-Up] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, "Yeah, that was terrible!

In March 2014, the international advocacy group [[European Digital Rights]] (EDRi) said that the European Parliament, in adopting a Data Protection Reform Package, rejected amendments that would have dropped charges against Snowden and granted him asylum or refugee status.&lt;ref name="EDRi"&gt;(March 12, 2014) [http://edri.org/european-parliament-votes-data-protection-reform-report-mass-surveillance/ European Parliament votes on the Data Protection Reform and the report on Mass surveillance].

In May 2014, [[NBC]]'s [[Brian Williams]] presented the first interview for American television.&lt;ref name=BoingBoingFirstAmericanInterview&gt;{{cite web |last=Jardin |first=Zeni |title=NBC airs Edward Snowden's first US TV interview |url=http://boingboing.net/2014/05/28/nbc-airs-brian-williams-interv.html |work=BoingBoing |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, ''The Washington Post'' reported that during his first year of Russian asylum, Snowden had received "tens of thousands of dollars in cash awards and appearance fees from privacy organizations and other groups," fielded inquiries about book and movie projects, and was considering taking a position with a South African foundation that would support work on security and privacy issues. "Any moment that he decides that he wants to be a wealthy person," said Snowden's attorney Ben Wizner, "that route is available to him," although the U.S. government could attempt to seize such proceeds.&lt;ref name=WaPoIncome&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Greg |title=U.S. officials scrambled to nab Snowden, hoping he would take a wrong step.

Also in May, the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]] unanimously decided to invite Snowden to testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In September, opposition parties in the German parliament filed constitutional complaints to force the government to let Snowden testify in Berlin. Snowden had refused a proposed video conference from Moscow, saying he wants to testify only in Berlin and asking for safe conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014].

On July 13, 2014, ''The Guardian'' published its first story based on an exclusive, seven-hour interview newly conducted with Snowden in a Moscow city centre hotel. Snowden condemned the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK's House of Commons]] on July 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-data-retention-and-investigatory-powers-bill |agency=[[Home Office]] |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bolstering the state's right to keep personal data held by Internet and phone companies. Snowden said it was very unusual for a public body to pass such emergency legislation except during total war. "I mean we don't have bombs falling. We don't have [[U-boat]]s in the harbor. It defies belief."&lt;ref name=GuardianCondemnation&gt;{{cite news |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden condemns Britain's emergency surveillance bill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/13/edward-snowden-condemns-britain-emergency-surveillance-bill-nsa |date=July 13, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Snowden had "caused fury" by attacking Britain. "His critics said the new surveillance Bill was being pushed through Parliament today largely because of his treachery in leaking Britain's spy secrets."&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite news |last=Drury |first=Ian |title=Snowden attacks the terror Bill prompted by his treason: Fugitive says plans to monitor communications 'defies belief' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2690901/Snowden-attacks-terror-Bill-prompted-treason-Fugitive-says-plans-monitor-communications-defies-belief.html |date=July 13, 2014 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13 and 17, ''The Guardian'' posted video clips, of about 2 minutes&lt;ref name=GuardianCondemnation /&gt; and 14 minutes&lt;ref name=EndUpInChains&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |last3=Healey |first3=Alex |last4=Sprenger |first4=Richard |last5=Khalili |first5=Mustafa |title=Edward Snowden: 'If I end up in chains in Guantánamo I can live with that' – video interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-video-interview |date=July 17, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in length, excerpted from the full interview. On July 18, ''The Guardian'' published a nearly 10,000-word edited transcript of their Snowden interview.&lt;ref name= EditedTranscript&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden interview – the edited transcript |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-interview-transcript |date=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after arriving in Moscow, Snowden said he is still learning Russian. He keeps late and solitary hours, effectively living on U.S. time. He does not drink, cooks for himself but doesn't eat much. "I don't live in absolute secrecy," he says. "I live a pretty open life—but at the same time I don't want to be a celebrity." He does not work for a Russian organization, yet is financially secure thanks to substantial savings from his years as a well-paid contractor and more recently numerous awards and speaking fees from around the world.&lt;ref name=Ispy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=I, spy: Edward Snowden in exile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill |date=July 18, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2014, six days after Snowden's one-year temporary asylum expired, his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, announced that Snowden had received a three-year residency permit. It allowed him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. Kucherena explained that Snowden had not been granted permanent political asylum, which required a separate process.&lt;ref name=ResidencyNBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nsa-snooping/edward-snowden-can-stay-russia-three-years-lawyer-says-n174776 |title=Edward Snowden Can Stay in Russia for Three Years, Lawyer Says |publisher=NBC News |date=August 7, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015==
In May 2015, Snowden's lawyer Ben Wizner said that Snowden's main source of income was speaking fees, which sometimes exceeded $10,000 per appearance.&lt;ref name=NYTvictories&gt;{{cite news |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=May 19, 2015 |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |title=Snowden Sees Some Victories, From a Distance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/world/europe/snowden-sees-some-victories-from-a-distance.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Snowden said that he does not intend to play any role in Russian politics and wants to devote his focus to U.S. issues. During a panel event, he said, "people say I live in Russia, but that's actually a little bit of a misunderstanding. I live on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIS8nYqHMro |title=Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security &amp; Free Expression |date=November 10, 2015 |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |website=Secret Sources: Whistleblower, National Security &amp; Free Expression: Edward Snowden |publisher=PEN America |last=Snowden |first=Edward |at=minute 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017==
In the waning days of the Obama administration, former CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] suggested that Russia should extradite Snowden to the United States as a "gift" to Donald Trump. The comment drew harsh criticism by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which noted that Snowden had been granted an extension of his stay until 2020, and said what Morell proposed would be a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-extends-snowden-asylum-couple-082503508.html |title=Russia Extends Snowden’s Asylum By ‘A Couple More Years’ |date=January 18, 2017 |accessdate=January 18, 2017 |publisher=International Business Times |last=Pascaline |first=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior U.S. official said in February 2017 that Russia was considering extraditing Snowden in order to "curry favor" with [[President Donald Trump]]. Snowden cited the comment as evidence that he was not a Russian spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 10, 2017 |title=Russia Considers Returning Snowden to U.S. to ‘Curry Favor’ With Trump: Official |author=CYNTHIA MCFADDEN and WILLIAM ARKIN |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921 |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Broadcasting Area (EBA)''' is defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as such:

:''The "European Broadcasting Area" is bounded on the west by the western boundary of [[International Telecommunication Union region|Region 1]], on the east by the [[meridian 40° East]] of [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] and on the south by the [[parallel 30° North]] so as to include the northern part of [[Saudi Arabia]] and that part of those countries bordering the [[Mediterranean]] within these limits. In addition, [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and those parts of the territories of [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]] lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.''&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"&gt;[http://www.sma.gov.jm/sites/default/files/publication_files/ITU-R_Radio_Regulations_2012_%202015_%20Article_5_Table%20of%20Frequencies.pdf ITU-R Radio Regulations (2012-2015)], International Telecommunication Union, available from the Spectrum Management Authority of Jamaica. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were added to the EBA at the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBA includes territory outside [[Europe]], and excludes some territory that is part of the European continent. For example,
[[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were defined as outside the EBA borders until 2007.&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S020200001A4501PDFE.pdf|title=ITU-R Radio Regulations - Articles edition of 2004 (valid in 2004-2007)|format=PDF|publisher=''[[International Telecommunication Union]]''|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After EBA was expanded by the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) to include those three countries,&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"/&gt; the only ITU member state with territory in Europe while remaining outside the EBA is [[Kazakhstan]]. While Kazakhstan is excluded from EBA, it is still eligible to apply for membership of the [[Member states of the Council of Europe#Applicants|Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=9998&amp;lang=EN|title=Situation in Kazakhstan and its Relations with the Council of Europe|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe|work=Document 11007: II General information, point 11|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the European Broadcasting Area have their origin in the regions served and linked by telegraphy cables in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The European Broadcasting Area plays a part in the definition of eligibility for active membership in the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and thus participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. As of November 2017, the European Broadcasting Union has 73 members from 56 countries, 33 associates from 21 countries, and 7 approved participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/about/members|title=EBU - Members|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIFA World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football, currently led by [[Belgian national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref name="FIFA"/&gt; The teams of the [[List of men's national football teams|member nations]] of [[FIFA]], football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams ([[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest ranked first.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches.

The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. The current version of the ranking system was first used on 16 August 2018, adapted from the [[Elo rating system]] used in [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]. The rankings remain slightly different from the unofficial  [[World Football Elo Ratings]], which makes different presumptions and adaptations to the FIFA rankings.

==History==
In December 1992, FIFA first published a listing in rank order of its member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. From the following August, this list was more frequently updated, to be published most months.&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking Procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/procedure/men.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes were implemented in January 1999 and again in July 2006, as a reaction to criticisms of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Revised FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid=104405.html |publisher=FIFA |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172351/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid%3D104405.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records of the rankings, such as listed at FIFA.com, reflect the method of calculation in use at the time, as the current method has not been applied retrospectively to rankings prior to July 2006. Membership of FIFA has expanded from 167 to 211 since the rankings began; all 211 members are currently included in the rankings.

===1993–1998 calculation method===
The ranking formula used from August 1993 until December 1998 was very simplistic and quickly became noticed for its lack of supporting factors. When the rankings were initially introduced, a team received one point for a draw or three for a victory in FIFA-recognised matches&amp;nbsp;– much the same as [[three points for a win|a traditional league scoring system]]. This was a quite simplistic approach, however, and FIFA quickly realised that there were many factors affecting international matches.

===1999–2006 calculation method===
{{Main|FIFA World Ranking system (1999–2006)}}
In January 1999, FIFA introduced a revised system of ranking calculation, incorporating many changes in response to criticism of inappropriate rankings. For the ranking all matches, their scores and importance were all recorded, and were used in the calculation procedure. Only matches for the senior men's national team were included. Separate ranking systems were used for other representative national sides such as women's and junior teams, for example the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]]. The women's rankings were, and still are, based on a procedure which is a simplified version of the Football Elo Ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women's World Ranking Procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/procedure/women.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major changes were as follows:
* the point ranking was scaled up by a factor of ten
* the method of calculation was changed to take into account factors including:
** the number of goals scored or conceded
** whether the match was played at home or away
** the importance of a match or competition
** regional strength
* a fixed number of points were no longer necessarily awarded for a victory or a draw
* match losers were able to earn points

Two new awards were introduced as part of the system:
*[[#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]]
*[[#Best Mover of the Year|Best Mover of the Year]]

The changes made the ranking system more complex, but helped improve its accuracy by making it more comprehensive.

===2006–2018 calculation method===
{{Main|FIFA World Ranking system (2006–2018)}}
FIFA announced that the ranking system would be updated following the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. The evaluation period was cut from eight to four years, and a simpler method of calculation was used to determine rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Great expectations |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid=104272.html |publisher=FIFA |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172346/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid%3D104272.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals scored and home or away advantage were no longer taken into account, and other aspects of the calculations, including the importance attributed to different types of match, were revised. The first set of revised rankings and the calculation methodology were announced on 12 July 2006.

This change was rooted at least in part in widespread criticism of the previous ranking system. Many football enthusiasts felt it was inaccurate, especially when compared to other ranking systems and that it was not sufficiently responsive to changes in the performance of individual teams.

===2018 ranking system update===
In September 2017, FIFA announced they were reviewing the ranking system and will decide after the end of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] if any changes are to be made to improve the ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifa to review rankings system after friendlies harm England's World Cup seeding |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/09/04/fifa-review-rankings-system-friendlies-harm-englands-world-cup/ |work=The Telegraph |date=4 September 2017 |accessdate=4 October 2017 |author=Ben Rumsby}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA announced on 10 June 2018 that the ranking system would be updated following the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. The calculation method to be adopted will be closely modeled after the [[Elo rating system]] and rankings of its member associations will be updated on a game-by-game basis. The weighting designated for each confederation for ranking purposes will be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Price |first1=Steve |title=How FIFA's New Ranking System Will Change International Soccer |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2018/06/11/how-fifas-new-ranking-system-will-change-international-soccer/#18864e86c412 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new methodology does not account for home or away games and margin of the victory, as Elo rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.in/football/fifa-world-cup/story/3522329/fifa-world-ranking-gets-overhaul-to-stop-manipulation-for-draw-seedings|title=FIFA World Ranking gets overhaul to stop manipulation for draw seedings|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA had intended to introduce the new ranking system in July 2018, but with no matches scheduled between the July and August ranking dates, delayed until August 2018. There was speculation from football journalists such as [[ESPN]]'s  Dale Johnson that this was because projections of the new rankings had seen relatively little change in positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FIFA Ranking: July 2018 final preview (new method) |url=http://www.football-rankings.info/2018/07/fifa-ranking-july-2018-final-preview.html |publisher=Football-rankings |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Germany – who had been eliminated in the first round of the World Cup – remaining as the top ranked team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Dale |title=Tweet sent 14:33, 20-07-18 |url=https://twitter.com/DaleJohnsonESPN/status/1020300705737867277 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA had originally planned to use existing world ranking points from June 2018 as the start value, but when the August rankings appeared, the starting points had been changed to an equal distribution of points between 1600 (Germany, as the previously top ranked team) and 868 (Anguilla, Bahamas, Eritrea, Somalia, Tonga and Turks and Caicos Islands, which had 0 points in June), according to the formula:

&lt;math&gt;P_{seeding}=1600-(R-1)*4&lt;/math&gt;,

where R is the rank in June 2018. When two or more teams had equal ranks, the following team received the next immediate rank possible, e.g. if two teams had R=11, the following team had R=12, not 13. Then the rating changes according to the games played after previous release were calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revision of the FIFA / Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=iklxmt2jejtjwf8qecba |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="August 18 rankings"&gt;{{cite web |title=August 2018 FIFA World Rankings |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=288/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a more dramatically altered ranking table, with Germany falling to 15th and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] champions France moving to the top of the ranking.&lt;ref name="August 18 rankings" /&gt;

When the system was introduced, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] debuted as the top-ranked team following their extended period of dominance in which they had reached the three previous FIFA World Cup finals, winning one of them. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] took the lead in the run up to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after winning eight and losing only one of nine qualification matches, while on the way scoring twenty goals and conceding just four. [[Italy national football team|Italy]] then led for a short time on the back of their own equally successful World Cup qualifying campaign, after which the top place was re-claimed by Germany.

Brazil's success in their lengthy qualifying campaign returned them to the lead for a brief period. Germany led again during the 1994 World Cup, until Brazil's victory in that competition gave them a large lead that would stand up for nearly seven years, until they were surpassed by a strong [[France national football team|France]] team that captured both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2000 European Football Championship]].

Success at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] restored Brazil to the top position, where they remained until February 2007, when Italy returned to the top for the first time since 1993 following their [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] win in Germany. Just one month later, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] replaced them, reaching the top for the first time, but Italy regained its place in April. After winning the [[Copa América 2007]] in July, Brazil returned to the top, but were replaced by Italy in September and then Argentina in October.

In July 2008, [[Spain national football team|Spain]] took over the lead for the first time, having won [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. Brazil began a sixth stint at the top of the rankings in July 2009 after winning the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009 Confederations Cup]], and Spain regained the title in November 2009 after winning every match in qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

In April 2010, Brazil returned to the top of the table. After winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Spain regained the top position and held it until August 2011, when the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] reached the top spot for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Ranking: Netherlands dethrone Spain |url=http://www.football-rankings.info/2011/08/fifa-ranking-netherlands-dethrone-spain.html |work=Football-Rankings.info |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to relinquish it the following month.

In July 2014, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] took over the lead once again, having won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. In July 2015, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching both the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, as well as the 2015 Copa America Final. In November 2015, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016]] qualifying group. Belgium led the rankings until April 2016, when Argentina returned to the top. On 6 April 2017, Brazil returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time since just prior to the 2010 World Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil back on top of FIFA Ranking, Netherlands slump to record low|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/fifa/243/post/3091643/brazil-back-on-top-of-fifa-ranking-as-netherlands-slump-to-record-low |work=ESPN |date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Germany regained the top spot in July after winning the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40517341|title=Fifa rankings: Northern Ireland reach highest point as Germany lead the way|work=BBC news|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, [[France national football team|France]] became the leader in the FIFA rankings again after nearly 16 years, having won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and this is also the first time FIFA adopted the Elo rating system to the ranking system. One month later, for the first time two teams were tied at the top spot as Belgium returned to the number one spot with the same ranking as France, to become joint leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45586533|title=Belgium and France top Fifa world rankings to be first ever joint-leaders|work=BBC news|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of the rankings==
The rankings are used by FIFA to rank the progression and current ability of the [[List of men's national association football teams|national football teams]] of its member nations, and claims that they create "a reliable measure for comparing national A-teams".&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke" /&gt; They are used as part of the calculation, or the entire grounds to [[Seed (tennis)|seed]] competitions. In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] tournament, the rankings were used to seed the groups in the competitions involving [[CONCACAF]] members (using the May rankings), [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] (with the July set of data), and [[UEFA]], using the specially postponed November 2007 ranking positions.

The October 2009 ranking was used to determine the seeds for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] final draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Organising Committee approves Final Draw procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/finaldraw/news/newsid=1142262/ |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=2 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225043322/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/finaldraw/news/newsid%3D1142262/ |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The March 2011 ranking was used to seed the draw for the [[2012 CAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament qualifying rounds#Second qualifying round|2012 CAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament second qualifying round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics – updated draw procedure, with teams |url=http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/8965-olympics--updated-draw-procedure-with-teams.html |work=CAFOnline.com |publisher=Confederation of African Football |accessdate=13 April 2011|date=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rankings are also used to determine the winners of the two annual awards national teams receive on the basis of their performance in the rankings.

The (English) Football Association uses the average of the last 24 months of rankings as one of the criteria for player work permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POINTS BASED SYSTEM GOVERNING BODY ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAYERS 2017/2018 SEASON |url=http://www.thefa.com/-/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/registrations/gbe-criteria-for-players-2017-2018.ashx |publisher=English Football Association |accessdate=29 November 2017 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Since their introduction in 1992, the FIFA World Rankings have been the subject of much debate, particularly regarding the calculation procedure and the resulting disparity between generally perceived quality and world ranking of some teams.  The perceived flaws in the FIFA system have led to the creation of a number of alternative rankings from football statisticians,&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt; including the [[World Football Elo Ratings]] and the [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} rankings.

The initial system was very simple, with no weighting for the quality of opponent or importance of a match. This saw [[Norway national football team|Norway]] reach second in October 1993 and July–August 1995, a ranking that was criticized at the time.&lt;ref name="BBCreport"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The world rankings riddle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1081551.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings were [[FIFA World Ranking system (1999–2006)|adapted in 1999]] to include weightings based on the importance of the match and the strength of the opponent. A win over a weak opponent resulted in fewer points being awarded than a win over a much stronger one. Further [[FIFA World Ranking system (2006–2018)|adaptations in 2006]] were made to reduce the number of years' results considered from 8 to 4,&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="travour"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA Rankings |url=http://www.travour.com/fifa-world-cup-2006/fifa-rankings.html |publisher=Travour.com |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173120/http://www.travour.com/fifa-world-cup-2006/fifa-rankings.html |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with greater reliance on matches from within the previous 12 months.

Still, criticisms of the rankings remained, with particular anomalies being noted including: the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] rise to fourth in 2006, to the surprise of even their own players;&lt;ref name="GnM"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA adapting new world rankings |url=https://www.fctables.com/pdf/FIFA-adapting-new-world-rankings.pdf |agency=Associated Press |date=2 June 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel national football team|Israel's]] climb to 15th in November 2008, which surprised the Israeli press;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA chief praises IFA's work |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225199592139&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2009 |quote=Blatter was also asked about Israel's unrealistic FIFA ranking.

Further criticisms of the 2006-2018 formula included the inability of hosts of major tournaments to retain a high place in the rankings, as the team participated in only lower-value friendly matches due to their automatic qualification  for the tournament. For example, [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosts Brazil fell to a record low ranking of 22nd in the world prior to that tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummings|first=Michael|title=FIFA World Rankings Place Brazil 18th, Reinforce Flawed Nature of System|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1488973-fifa-world-rankings-place-brazil-18th-reinforce-flawed-nature-of-system|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freitas|first=Paulo|title=Scolari blames FIFA for Brazil's poor ranking|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/48211_scolari_blames_fifa_for_brazil_s_poor_ranking.html|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which they then finished fourth. [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] hosts Russia had the lowest ranking (70th) at the tournament, where they reached quarterfinals.

In the 2010s, teams realized the ranking system could be 'gamed', specifically by avoiding playing non-competitive matches, particularly against weaker opponents.&lt;ref name = "Switzerland"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/17/england-seeded-switzerland-world-cup-draw-friendlies |title=With a bit of planning England could have been seeded ahead of the Swiss |first=Simon |last=Burnton |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the low weighting of friendlies meant that even victories could reduce a team's ''average'' score: in other words, a team could win a match and lose points. Prior to the seeding of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup preliminary draw]], Romania even appointed a ranking consultant, playing only one friendly in the year before the draw.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/07/23/romania-wales-set-to-be-surprise-world-cup-top-seeds/30563797/ |title=Romania, Wales set to be surprise World Cup top seeds |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |quote=Romania took advice from a consultant who decoded some mysteries of a ranking system used by FIFA since 1992.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/sport/fotbal/exclusiv-rl--romania--in-top-10-mondial--cum-au-depasit-franta-burleanu-si--sfatuitorul-secret--384576 |title=Burleanu: "Am consultat specialiști în clasamentul FIFA."

Surprisingly, they heeded my advice.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations had been made against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], who were a seeded team at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] having played only three friendly matches in the previous year,&lt;ref name = "Switzerland"/&gt; and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Dale |title=FIFA World Ranking gets overhaul to stop manipulation for draw seedings |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/fifa-world-cup/story/3522329/fifa-world-ranking-gets-overhaul-to-stop-manipulation-for-draw-seedings |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of regional strength multiplier in the ranking formula before 2018 was also accused of further reinforcing and perpetuating the bias for and against certain regions. FIFA's use of regional multiplier was cited as a primary reason why most teams in AFC (Asia) and CONCACAF (North America) held significantly lower FIFA rankings compared to their position in the World Football Elo Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therostrumblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/04/soccer-rankings-farewell-fifa-hello-elo/ |title=Soccer rankings: farewell FIFA, hello Elo? |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current calculation method==
On 10 June 2018, the new ranking system was approved by the FIFA Council. It is based on the [[Elo rating system]] and after each game points will be added to or subtracted from a team's rating according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P = P_\text{before}+I(W-W_e)&lt;/math&gt;
where:

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;before&lt;/sub&gt; – the team's number of points before the game
* ''I'' – the importance coefficient:
** 05 – friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows
** 10 – friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows
** 15 – Nations League matches (group stage)
** 25 – Nations League matches (play-offs and finals)
** 25 – Confederations' final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers
** 35 – Confederations' final competitions matches (before quarter-finals)
** 40 – Confederations' final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later), FIFA Confederations Cup matches
** 50 – FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals)
** 60 – FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals and later)
* ''W'' – the result of the game:
** 0 – loss after regular or extra time
** 0.5 – draw or loss in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]
** 0.75 – win in a penalty shootout
** 1 – win after regular or extra time.
:: If a game ends with a winner, but still requires a Penalty Shoot-Out (PSO) (i.e. in the second game of a [[two-legged tie]]), it is considered as a regular game and the PSO is disregarded.
* ''W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' – the expected result of the game:
::&lt;math&gt;W_e = \frac{1}{10^{-\frac{dr}{600}} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''dr'' is the difference between two teams' ratings before the game.

Negative points in knockout stages of final competitions will not affect teams' ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=iklxmt2jejtjwf8qecba Revision of the FIFA / Coca - Cola World Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Each year FIFA hands out two awards to its member nations, based on their performance in the rankings. They are:

===Team of the Year===
Team of the Year is awarded to the team that finishes top of the FIFA World Ranking. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] are the Team of the Year for the third time in the 24-year history of the rankings. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] hold the records for most consecutive wins (seven, between 1994 and 2000) and most wins overall (twelve). The table below shows the three best teams of each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid=1351535.html ''Team of the Year Award 2010''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218180552/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid%3D1351535.html |date=18 December 2010 }} on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Best Mover of the Year===
The Best Mover of the Year was awarded to the team who made the best progress up the rankings over the course of the year. In the FIFA rankings, this is not simply the team that has risen the most places, but a calculation is performed in order to account for the fact that it becomes progressively harder to earn more points the higher up the rankings a team is.&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke" /&gt;

The calculation used is the number of points the team has at the end of the year (''z'') multiplied by the number of points it earned during the year (''y''). The team with the highest index on this calculation received the award. The table below shows the top three best movers from each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html ''Best Mover of the Year''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720000000/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html |date=20 July 2008 }} on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/news/newsid=1560354/index.html ''Spain on top and Wales highest climber''] on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;

The award has not been an official part of the awards since 2006.

An example of the informal on-going "Mover of the Year" award is the recognition made by FIFA to Colombia in 2012 in an official press release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/news/newsid=1974233/index.html Spain finish 2012 on top, Colombia in fifth]. FIFA.com. Retrieved on 12 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the calculation methodology had changed to the difference in ranking points over the course of the year (rather than the methodology used in the official award from 1993 to 2006). The results for latter years are based on a similar methodology.

[[File:Gaststaette Roehrl Eilsbrunn.jpg|thumb|Gaststätte Röhrl in Eilsbrunn (main building)]]
The '''Gaststätte Röhrl''' (Röhrl restaurant) is a [[restaurant]] with [[beer garden]] in Eilsbrunn in the district of [[Regensburg]] ([[Germany]]). Since 1658 it is continuously operated and owned by the Röhrl family.

In November 2010 the [[Guinness Book of Records]] introduced the restaurant as the oldest continuously operated restaurant in the world, conducting business for more than three and half centuries.&lt;ref name="mz1"&gt;[http://www.mittelbayerische.de/index.cfm?pid=10070&amp;pk=607759 "Röhrl" ist das älteste Wirtshaus der Welt (German), accessed on 27 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and property ==
[[File:Gaststaette Roehrl Eilsbrunn Giebelseite Saaltrakt Westseite.jpg|thumb|upright = 0.6| Festival hall ("Festsaal"), western side]]
The restaurant is located on the western edge of Eilsbrunn, opposite the parish church of St. Wolfgang.

The oldest part of the restaurant, the main building is a two-storey building with garett [[hip roof]] and the taproom behind [[Arch|segmental arch windows]] on the ground floor. This component was built before 1800, maybe early as 1665 as the inscription ''MDCLXV'' suggests. Approximately 50 guests can be accommodated; the decor is simple and largely obtained in the first half of the 20th century according to their time of origin. Above the entrance stands a large [[dormer]] with a [[pulley]] from the roof.

A two-storey [[gabled roof]] construction from 1839 connects to the main building. In the early 20th century another [[saddleback roof]] building for a festival hall with space for 250 guests was erected; the [[Art Nouveau]] door at the entrance to the old building was originally part of this component. The beer garden hosts further 400 guests.

The property is under [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]].

== History ==
The restaurant is operated in the eleventh generation by members of the family Röhrl.

In 1658 the family got the restaurant by marriage of Andreas Röhrl (app. 1636–1706) with Susanna Hofmeister, the innkeeper Georg Hofmeister's daughter. Röhrl was henceforth brewer and landlord of Eilsbrunn. Married twice he left the business to his son Joachim (1676-1737). The year ''MDCLXV'' on the entrance facade suggests that a conversion or new construction of the property was done in 1665. After the death of the fifth Röhrl male in a row, his widow took over the business. In 1839 she reconstructed the building and set up an extension. She later bequeathed the property to her youngest son. A picture in the guest room shows her grandson and successor to her son Johann Nepomuk Röhrl. The opening of the nearby railroad made the area a popular tourist destination for visitors even from other parts of Germany, so that a large festival hall and guest rooms (now discontinued) were erected.

After the death of another Johann Nepomuk Röhrl, taking over the inn after [[World War II]], the daughter Antonie Kolbe took over the Gaststätte Röhrl. In 1971 the brewery was shut down. Since 2006 the inn is directed by her nephew Muk Röhrl, a skilled [[Cook (profession)|cook]] and [[businessman]].

Today the beer sold in the restaurant is mainly produced by the Röhrl brewery in [[Straubing]]. This brewery was founded by Josef Röhrl, the first Johann Nepomuk's brother, in 1881.

Global HealthShare® initiative (GHS) is a program launched in June 2010 by the [[University of California, Davis]] Center of Excellence for [[Nutritional genomics|Nutritional Genomics]]. The program plans to share resources to improve the health in [[developing countries]]. Alliances with other research institutions, humanitarian organizations and private companies around the world have been made to meet this goal.

The organization will use a multidisciplinary approach against [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[Infectious disease|infectious]] disease, breaking down their efforts into two main research "cores": the Nutrition Core and Mucosal Immunity Core. The former focuses on fighting [[malnutrition]] and the latter on developing new ways to deliver [[vaccines]] more effectively to developing countries. The program differentiates itself from others like it by focusing on the delivery of the beneficial product to the end-user rather than the academic research process.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

V. | editor4-last = Spier | editor4-first = F.  | publisher = Uchitel Publishing | pages = 274–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W.

The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000. Discours de la ministre sur les priorite´s de la pre´sidence franc¸aise dans le domaine de l’environnement devant la commission environnement—consommation—sante´du parlement europe´en, 6 juillet 2000, Strasbourg’, French Presidency of the EU [online] Available at: www.presidence-europe.fr [Accessed 03 November 2011]. and Kohl, H. et al., 1997. Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global politics''', also known as '''world politics''',{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}} names both the discipline that studies the political and economical patterns of the world and the field that is being studied. At the centre of that field are the different processes of [[political globalization]] in relation to questions of social power.

The discipline studies the relationships between cities, [[nation-states]], shell-states, [[multinational corporations]], [[non-governmental organizations]] and [[international organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Jan-Erik Lane, ''Globalization and Politics: Promises and Dangers'', Aldershot, Ashgate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Current areas of discussion include national and [[ethnic]] conflict regulation, [[democracy]] and the politics of national [[self-determination]], [[globalization]] and its relationship to democracy, conflict and peace studies, [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], and the [[international political economy]] of the environment. One important area of global politics is contestation in the global political sphere over legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= van Seeters | first2= Paul | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 2: Global Social Movements and Global Civil Society | url= https://www.academia.edu/7305007/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._2_Global_Social_Movements_and_Global_Civil_Society_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global politics is said by some to be distinct from the field of international politics (commonly seen as a branch of [[international relations]]{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}), as it "does not stress the primacy of intergovernmental relations and transactions".{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} This distinction however has not always been held among authors and political scientists, who often use the term "international politics" to mean global politics.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}

==Defining the field==
Beginning in the late nineteenth century, several groups extended the definition of the political community beyond nation-states to include much, if not all, of humanity. These "internationalists" include [[Marxists]], human rights advocates, environmentalists, peace activists, [[feminists]], and [[dalits]]. This was the general direction of thinking on global politics, though the term was not used as such.&lt;ref name="Vol4"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | pages= x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern "world politics perspective" is often identified with the works of [[Joseph Nye]] and [[Robert Keohane]], in particular their 1972 work ''Transnational Relations and World Politics''. Here, the authors argued that state-centric views of international relations were inadequate frameworks to utilize in political science or international relations studies due to the increased globalization.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} Today, the practices of global politics are defined by values: norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]] or [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each. Over the last couple of decades cosmopolitanism has become one of the key contested ideologies of global politics:
{{cquote| Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref name="Vol4" /&gt;}}

== Debates ==

The intensification of [[globalization]] led some writers to suggest that states were no longer relevant to global politics.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Horsman and Andrew Marshall, After the Nation-State, London, Harper Collins, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been subject to debate:

{{cquote| On the other hand, other commentators have been arguing that states have remained essential to global politics. They have facilitated globalizing processes and projects; not been eclipsed by them. They have been rejuvenated because, among other reasons, they are still the primary providers of (military) security in the global arena; they are still the paramount loci for articulating the voices of (procedurally democratic) national communities, and for ordering their interactions with similar polities; and finally, they are indispensable to relations of (unequal) economic exchange insofar as they legitimize and enforce the global legal frameworks that enable globalization in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._1_Global_Political_and_Legal_Governance_2014_| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xlii}}; AG McGrew and PG Lewis, ''Global Politics'', Cambridge, Polity Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Healthy Life Years''' indicator (HLY) is a European structural indicator computed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301003227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=HLTH_HLYE Eurostat]. It is one of the summary measures of population health, known as health expectancies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu/pdf/Glossary_v4.pdf Glossary EurOhex website]&lt;/ref&gt; composite measures of health that combine [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] data to represent overall population health on a single indicator.&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Robine. ''Summarizing health status''. In: Pencheon D, Guest C, Melzer D, Gray JAM, editors. Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;160-168&lt;/ref&gt; HLY measures the number of remaining years that a person of a certain age is expected to live without disability. It is actually a disability-free [[life expectancy]].

== History ==
The European Union has decided to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide synthetic measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;B. Cox, H. Van Oyen, E. Cambois, C. Jagger, S. Le Roy, J-M Robine, I.Romieu. The reliability of the Minimum European Health Module. ''International Journal of Public Health'' 2009;(54):55-60 (DOI 10.1007/s00038-009-7104-y), p57&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1177:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)]&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 to be one of the structural indicators to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals ([[Lisbon Strategy]]) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/indicators/lifeyears_en.htm Health Life Years in the core of the Lisbon Strategy ]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chrodis.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and diabetes.'''   

Detailed information on the Health Expectancies in Europe are available from the EurOhex Advanced research on European health expectancies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu EurOhex]&lt;/ref&gt; while latest Healthy Life Years values can be found on the general public website devoted to the Healthy Life Years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthy-life-years.eu healthy-life-years.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Dramatic increases in [[life expectancy]] in the most developed countries - and therefore in the countries of the European Union - constitute one of the most remarkable advances of the last decades. But why prolong life if this is to be accompanied by increases in severe mental and physical impairment? Thus a further challenge confronts the European Community:
:''increasing life expectancy in good health.''

In this context, the classical mortality indicators are no longer sufficient to monitor the health status of European populations. The availability of health expectancy indicators dividing life expectancy into life spent in different states of health is useful to health authorities in the field of [[public health]] and [[health policy|health policies]] provided that these indicators allow comparisons over time and between geographic areas and between socio-economic groups in society. As the post-war generation reaches retirement, the pace of ageing will increase dramatically in our European societies, with profound social effects. HLY is an important indicator :
* Health of a population is inherently difficult to measure because it is often defined differently among individuals, populations, cultures, and even across time periods.
* Many studies focus on measures such as physical impairment or disability in functional tasks or presence of a specific chronic disease. Self-assessed health, being much more global and subjective in nature, can incorporate a variety of aspects of health including cognitive and emotional as well as physical status, and therefore provide insights into the needs of an [[ageing]] society. Hence, self-assessed health measures as HLY may be a particularly important indicator of the potential demand for health services and long-term care needs.
* The two components of the calculation of the HLY are life tables and self-perceived disability assessed by health surveys. From 1995 to 2001, data from the Eurostat European Community Household Panel (ECHP) survey have been used for the EU-15 Member States. Its successor, the Eurostat EU-SILC has been used from 2005 onwards for the EU-25 and then 27 Member States.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

== Example ==
[[File:HLY 2010.jpg|thumb|Healthy Life Years in Europe - 2010]]
* The HLY estimates are provided for the 27 EU Member States using the EU-SILC data for 2010 (see graph above)
* The first analyses of the healthy life years values disclose significant inequalities among the European countries.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jagger, C. Gillies, F. Mascone, E. Cambois, H. Van Oyen, W.J. Nusselder, J.-M. Robine, EHLEIS team. Inequalities in healthy life years in the 25 countries of the European Union in 2005: a cross-national meta-regression analysis. ''The Lancet'' 2008;372(9656):2124-2131 (DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61594-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical Findings==
Different estimations are made for men and women. In 2015, the number of healthy years of women in the EU-28 was estimated to be at 63.3 years and of men to be at 62.6 years. The interesting part of this is that the gender gap was considerably smaller in regards to healthy life years than to overall life expectancy. This would imply that biologically, gender would not really affect the rate and time at which humans would become healthy yet gender would play a role in how long human beings would be able to live in an unhealthy state. 

==Data Sources and their Availability==
Eurostat calculates information about the healthy life years at three different ages during a person's life. One is at birth, another is at age 50, and the third is at age 65, with an indicator used separately for men and women. The data is calculated and collected by using mortality statistics as well as self perceived longstanding activity limitations- a dimension that captures longstanding limitation in regards to health and/or disability to perform usual and frequent activities. 
An example of a question that might be asked concerning the longstanding activity limitation is: "For the last six months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities that people usually do?" Some available answers are "severely limited", "limited but not severely", or "not limited at all".

The '''Indian subcontinent''' is a southern [[region]] and [[peninsula]] of [[Asia]], mostly situated on the [[Indian Plate]] and projecting southwards into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Himalayas]]. [[Geology|Geologically]], the Indian subcontinent is related to the land mass that rifted from [[Gondwana]] and merged with the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian plate]] nearly 55 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; [[Geography|Geographically]], it is the [[peninsula]]r region in south-central Asia delineated by the [[Himalayas]] in the north, the [[Hindu Kush]] in the west, and the [[Arakan Mountains|Arakanese]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Graham P. p. 10"/&gt; Politically, the Indian subcontinent includes [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;"Indian subcontinent".

== Name==

According to ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term "subcontinent" signifies a "subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity" and also a "large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent". It is first attested in 1845 to refer to the [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]s, before they were regarded as separate continents. Its use to refer to the Indian subcontinent is seen from the early twentieth century. It was especially convenient for referring to the region comprising both [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s under [[British Paramountcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=subcontinent|id=192528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=Indian subcontinent|id=94389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Indian subcontinent also has a geological significance. Similar to various continents, it was a part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. A series of tectonic splits caused formation of various basins, each drifting in various directions. The geological region called "Greater India" once included [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], [[Antarctica]] and Austrolasia along with the Indian subcontinent basin. As a geological term, Indian subcontinent has meant that region formed from the collision of the Indian basin with Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wynn Jones|title=Applications of Palaeontology: Techniques and Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrPiq_8pkAwC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49920-0|pages=267–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hinsbergen | first=D.

The Indian subcontinent has been a term particularly common in the British Empire.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus&gt;John McLeod, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Y3MH3dj6MC&amp;pg=PA1 The history of India]'', page 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-313-31459-4}}; note: McLeod does not include Afghanistan in Indian subcontinent or South Asia;&lt;br&gt;Jim Norwine &amp; Alfonso González, ''The Third World: states of mind and being'', pages 209, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988, {{ISBN|0-04-910121-8}}&lt;br&gt;Raj S. Bhopal, ''Ethnicity, race, and health in multicultural societies'', pages 33, Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-19-856817-7}}; Quote: "The term South Asian refers to populations originating from the Indian subcontinent, effectively India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka;&lt;br&gt;Lucian W. Pye &amp; Mary W. Pye, ''Asian Power and Politics'', pages 133, Harvard University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-674-04979-9}}&lt;br&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer, ''The Oxford handbook of global religions'', pages 465, Oxford University Press US, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-513798-1}}&lt;br&gt;Sugata Bose &amp; Ayesha Jalal, ''Modern South Asia'', pages 3, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-30787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!-- not one of these sources is from the "British Empire", and none of them talk about the British Empire. The earliest use of the term I could find is from 1915, and it is American, not British--&gt;

The geographical region has historically simply been known as "India" (in antiquity referring to the [[Indus Valley]] region, not the entire subcontinent).  Other related terms are [[Greater India]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=mittal&gt;Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby, ''Religions of South Asia: An Introduction'', page 3, Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|9781134593224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathleen M page 10"&gt;Kathleen M. Baker and Graham P. Chapman, ''The Changing Geography of Asia'', page 10, Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|9781134933846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
And the terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia" are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus/&gt; There is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=anderson5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jona Razzaque 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia’s Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh0cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-62445-5|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The less common term "South Asian subcontinent" has seen occasional use since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Official Records: Proces-verbaux Officiels. Supplement. Supplement  1624-1683, United Nations, 1972, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
Geologically, the Indian subcontinent was first a part of so-called "Greater India",&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1/&gt; a region of [[Gondwana]] that drifted away from [[East Africa]] about 160 million years ago, around the Middle Jurassic period.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The region experienced high volcanic activity and plate subdivisions, creating Madagascar, Seychelles, Antarctica, Austrolasia and the Indian subcontinent basin. The Indian subcontinent drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Paleocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains one of the geologically active areas, prone to major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethany D.

Using the more expansive definition – counting India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries – the Indian subcontinent covers about 4.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent or 3.3% of the world's land surface area.&lt;ref name=JJCO&gt;Desai, Praful B. 2002.

The Indian subcontinent is a natural physical landmass in South Asia, geologically the dry-land portion of the [[Indian Plate]], which  has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"/&gt; 
Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John L. Esposito|author2=Emad El-Din Shahin|title=The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUcSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA453 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-063193-2|pages=453–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; the valleys of [[Manipur]] in its east, and by maritime routes.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"/&gt; More difficult but historically important interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]. These routes and interactions have led to the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|spread of Buddhism]]  out of the Indian subcontinent into other parts of Asia. And the [[Islamic conquests in India|Islamic expansion]] arrived into the Indian subcontinent in two ways, through Afghanistan on land and to Indian coast through the maritime routes on the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"&gt;{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine B.|last2=Talbot|first2=Cynthia|title=India Before Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80904-7|pp=5–8, 12–14, 51, 78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies. [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], it had formed the whole territory of [[Greater India]].&lt;ref name="mittal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathleen M page 10"/&gt;

The term "Indian continent" is first introduced in the early 20th century, when most of the territory was  part of [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref&gt;"Indian subcontinent" is used by Henry D. Baker, ''British India With Notes On Ceylon Afghanistan And Tibet'' (1915), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.236168/2015.236168.British-India#page/n403/mode/2up p. 401].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu Kush]], centered on eastern  [[Afghanistan]], is the boundary connecting the Indian subcontinent with [[Central Asia]] to the northwest, and the [[Persian Plateau]] to the west.

The '''International Table Tennis Federation''' ('''ITTF''') is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for all national [[table tennis]] associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/|title=Official ITTF website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the ITTF includes overseeing rules and regulations and seeking technological improvement for the sport of table tennis. The ITTF is responsible for the organization of numerous international competitions, including the [[World Table Tennis Championships]] that has continued since 1926.

==Founding history==
The ITTF was founded in 1926 by William Henry Lawes of Wymondham, the nine founding members being [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Sweden]] and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |title=ITTF Archives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301103409/http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first international tournament was held in January 1926 in [[Berlin]] while the first [[World Table Tennis Championships]] was held in December 1926 in London.

Toward the end of 2000, the ITTF instituted several rules changes aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport. The older 38&amp;nbsp;mm balls were officially replaced by 40&amp;nbsp;mm balls.&lt;ref name="Timeline of TT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?id=13118&amp;category=menus |title=ITTF Table Tennis Timeline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710213034/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?id=13118&amp;category=menus |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the ball's air resistance and effectively slowed down the game.

On 29 February 2008, the ITTF announced several rules changes after an ITTF Executive Meeting in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[China]] with regards to a player's eligibility to play for a new association. The new ruling is to encourage associations to develop their own players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/press_release.asp?ID=14865&amp;PT_Title=&amp;s_Year=&amp; |title=New Rule in Favour of the Development of Table Tennis |publisher=Ittf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312221243/http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/press_release.asp?ID=14865&amp;PT_Title=&amp;s_Year=&amp; |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the ITTF is in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The previous [[president]] of the ITTF was [[Adham Sharara]] from [[Canada]]; the current president since 2014 is {{ill|Thomas Weikert|de}} from Germany.

==Membership==

===Continental Federations===
The ITTF recognises six continental federations.&lt;ref name="ITTF directory" /&gt; Each continental federation has a president as its top official and owns its constitution.&lt;ref name="ittf handbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |title=I T T F |accessdate=2016-08-12 |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904230922/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are recognised federations:

===National Federations===
{{further|:Category:National Members of the International Table Tennis Federation}}

There are currently 226&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Table-Tennis/Features/2017/May/31/Thomas-Weikert-Wins-2017-ITTF-Presidential-Election&lt;/ref&gt; member associations within the ITTF.&lt;ref name="ITTF directory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |title=ITTF Directory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904230922/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{National Members of the International Table Tennis Federation|state=expanded}}

==Organisational Structure==
All member associations of the ITTF attend annual general meeting (AGM).&lt;ref name="ittf handbook"/&gt; Agendas on changes of the constitution, laws of table tennis, applications for membership etc. are discussed and finalised through votes. Also, the president of ITTF, 8 executive vice-presidents, and 32 or less continental representatives are elected at an AGM, serving for a four-year term. The president, executive vice-presidents, and the chairman of the athletes' commission compose executive committee.

The executive committee, continental representatives and presidents of the six continental federations or their appointees compose the board of directors (Board). The Board manages the work of the ITTF between AGMs. Several committees, commissions, working groups or panels work under the constitution of ITTF or under the Board.

==Role in diplomacy==
Unlike the organisations for more popular sports, the ITTF tends to recognise teams from generally unrecognised governing bodies for disputed territory. For example, it currently recognises the [[Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo]] even though Kosovo is excluded from most other sports. It recognised the People's Republic of China in 1953 and allowed some basic diplomacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=McCurry |authorlink= |author= |author2= |title=Ping-pong diplomacy back on table as Chinese premier visits Japan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/china |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2008-05-30 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |title=ITTF Archives: 1953 Bucarest AGM Minutes |date=1953-03-23 |work= |publisher=ITTF |page=2 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |quote=Only the People's Republic of China Table Tennis Association was taken at this stage, in order to regularise their playing in the Championships and attending Congress.

which lead to an opening for [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], called "[[Ping Pong Diplomacy]]", in the early 1970s.

==Rules==

===Player eligibility===
For ITTF World Title events, a player is eligible to play for his association by registering with the ITTF. If the player chooses to play for a new association, he shall register with the ITTF, through the new association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?ID=16537&amp;Category= |title=Information about the Eligibility Rule |date=2008-10-13 |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616204551/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?ID=16537&amp;Category= |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The player shall not represent the new association before.
* The player will be eligible to play for the new association after three, five, seven years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 15, 18, 21 respectively
* If the player is 21 years of age or older, he will not be registered with the ITTF and not be eligible to represent a new association at World Title events.

===Service and point system===
The table tennis point system was reduced from a 21 to an 11-point scoring system in 2001.&lt;ref name="Timeline of TT" /&gt; A game shall be won by the player or pair first scoring 11 points unless both players or pairs score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player or pair subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. This was intended to make games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a player from hiding the ball during service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/ColinEvolution.pdf |title=Rules Evolution |accessdate=2010-07-27 |author=Colin Clemett |format=PDF |publisher=ITTF |page=9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331202309/http://www.ittf.com/museum/ColinEvolution.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to increase the average length of rallies and to reduce the server's advantage. Today, the game changes from time to time mainly to improve on the excitement for television viewers.

===Speed glue ban===
{{See also|Speed glue}}

In 2007, ITTF's board of directors in Zagreb decided to implement the VOC-free glue rule at Junior events, starting from 1 January 2008, as a transitional period before the full implementation of the VOC ban on 1 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/ittf_misc/Racket_Control_2009__.pdf |title=Official Message to Table Tennis Manufacturers And National Associations |date=2008-11-24 |format=PDF |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117100926/http://ittf.com/ittf_misc/Racket_Control_2009__.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2009, all speed glue was to have been banned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75142">This is a list of current [[professional boxing]] rankings, which includes the latest rankings by each one of the sport's four major sanctioning bodies, as well as other well-regarded sites and entities.

==Overview==

As professional boxing has four major sanctioning bodies ([[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]) each with their own champions, the sport doesn't have a centralized ranking system. The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their "Super" and "Regular" champions are excluded from the rankings but their "Interim" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.

In addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|TBRB]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and ''The Ring'' is to crown a single champion for each division. Every single one of these lists are assembled by a committee but since the 90s, other parties have experimented with computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/02/boxrec-coms-computerized-rankings/|title=Boxrec.com's computerized rankings » Boxing News|date=1 February 2015|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbrb.org/mission/|title=FEEDBACK - Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|website=Tbrb.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known computerized rankings are published by [[BoxRec]] and updated daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxing247.com/boxing-news/invaluable-site-boxrecs-new-ratings-the-pound-for-pound-best-of-all-time/57751|title=Invaluable site BoxRec's new ratings: the pound-for-pound best of all-time! - Boxing News|date=14 June 2016|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list compiling the latest installment of all the previously mentioned rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Military [[globalization]]''' is defined by [[David Held]] as “the process which embodies the growing extensity and intensity of military relations among the political units of the [[world system]]. Understood as such, it reflects both the expanding network of worldwide military ties and relations, as well as the impact of [[history of military technology|key military technological innovations]] (from [[steamship]]s to [[satellite]]s), which over time, have reconstituted the world into a single [[geostrategic]] space."&lt;ref name=held&gt;David Held, Anthony McGrew, David Goldblatt &amp; Jonathan Perraton. (1999). ''Global Transformations; Politics, Economics and Culture'', Cambridge Polity Press, p 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Military globalization implies firmer integration of [[armed forces]] around the world into the global military system. For [[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]] military globalization entails “long-distance networks of interdependence in which force, and the threat or promise of force, are employed.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane &amp; Joseph Nye. (2002). ''Power and Interdependence'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co, p 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Held&lt;ref&gt;''Global Transformations'', p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; divides the military globalization into three distinct phenomena: 

#The globalization of the war system. This refers to the “[[geopolitical]] order, [[great power]] rivalry, conflict and security relations.”
#The global system of [[arms industry|arms production]] and transfers, reflected in the global arms dynamics.
#The geo-governance of violence, “embracing the formal and informal international regulation of the acquisition, deployment and use of military force.”

All three processes above “are connected to technological development, which made them possible in the first place. The result is increasing global interdependence and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;Armin Krishnan. (2008). ''Wars as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of military globalization starts with the [[Age of Discovery]], when the [[European colonial empires]] began military operations on the global scale. Their "[[imperial rivalry]] led to the [[First World War]], which was the first [[global conflict]] in world history."&lt;ref&gt;''Wars as Business'', p 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Keohane dates military globalization at least from the time of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane. (2002). ''Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the Nordic Council.svg|thumb|Flag before 2016]]
The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary co-operation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The official and working languages of both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and learned as a foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=2008-08-06|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=2017-06-22|work=ERR|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. Étienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation ("[[Nordek]]") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name="HM2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name="HM2"/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name="HM3"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name="HM3"/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.comingsoon.no/en/theme/education-and-research-in-the-nordic-region/language Language co-operation], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Council have the ability to issue proposals in their own languages, and official documents are translated to cater to all five of the major Nordic languages. Discussions for bringing Finnish and Icelandic into equal footing with the three other languages has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asemaa-parannetaan-pohjoismaisessa-yhteistyoessae|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asemaa parannetaan pohjoismaisessa yhteistyössä|date=2017-11-02|access-date=2018-06-01|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council About the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, but also publishes material in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 |work=Norden |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers The Nordic Council of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged "observers" to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and "observe" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them "observer members" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights" as guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/bag-om-nordisk-raad/the-nordic-council/rules-of-procedure-for-the-nordic-council Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, "within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/sessions-and-meetings/nordic-council-sessions/about-the-sessions-of-the-nordic-council About the Sessions of the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'', namely in all the [[Baltic states]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]] as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsuxRJH&amp;sig=CzVoYbflgNMAIdhyDNtWfiDdtk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+nordic+council+observer+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsvpPKI&amp;sig=vVIg3P4gkhs6kJnW-goho8laWeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53MbMjK3WAhVHQJoKHW_QDmkQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20nordic%20council%20observer%201991&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PVUeUqmHs&amp;sig=cRt4I8tK-gjmM2hSIgRRlK2FyTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/the-faroe-islands-apply-for-membership-in-the-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-of-ministers-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently{{When|date=March 2018}}, three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nordic unification ==
{{further|Scandinavism}}
 
Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paleocontinent''' or '''palaeocontinent''' is a distinct area of [[continental crust]] that existed as a major landmass in the geological past.&lt;ref name="Nance" /&gt; There have been many different landmasses throughout Earth’s time. They range in sizes, some are just a collection of small microcontinents while others are large conglomerates of crust. As time progresses and sea levels rise and fall more crust can be exposed making way for larger landmasses. The continents of the past shaped the evolution of organisms on Earth and contributed to the climate of the globe as well. As land masses break apart, species are separated and those that were once the same now have evolved to their new climate. The constant movement of these landmasses greatly determines the distribution of organisms on the Earth's surface. This is evident with how similar fossils are found on completely separate continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/continents.html|title=Rejoined continents [This Dynamic Earth, USGS]|website=pubs.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as continents move, mountain building events (orogenies) occur, causing a shift in the global climate as new rock is exposed and then there is more exposed rock at higher elevations. This causes glacial ice expansion and an overall cooler global climate. Which effects the overall global climate trend of the Earth. The movement of the continents greatly affects the overall dispersal of organisms throughout the world and the trend in climate throughout the Earth’s history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Caledonian-Orogenic-Belt|title=Caledonian orogenic belt {{!}} geological region, Europe|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Avalonia]], which collided together during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] to form the [[Old Red Sandstone]] paleocontinent of [[Laurussia]].&lt;ref name="Nance"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/18/12/pdf/i1052-5173-18-12-4.pdf | title=The Rheic Ocean: Origin, Evolution, and Significance | author=Nance R.D. | journal=GSA Today | volume=18 | issue=12 | pages=4–12 | doi=10.1130/GSATG24A.1 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example includes a collision that occurred during the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian time when there was a collision between the two continents of Tarimsky and Kirghiz-Kazakh.

== Examples ==
The examples below are condensed in order to portray a brief overview of several paleocontinents.

=== Rodinia ===
[[File:Rodinia reconstruction.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the supercontinent Rodinia.]]

==== Location ====
[[Rodinia]] was centered on the equator and reached from 60° N to 60° S.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/Export/midcontinent/rodinia.pdf|title=The first supercontinent-1.1 billion years ago|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time period ====
1.2-1 bya to 800-850 mya, [[Proterozoic Eon]] - end of [[Precambrian]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Z.X. Li, et al.|first=S.V. Bogdanova|date=11 June 2017|title=Assembly, configuration, and break-up history of Rodinia: A synthesis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301926807001635|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=160|pages=179–210|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2007.04.021|bibcode=2008PreR..160..179L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formation ====
It was the first supercontinent to form on Earth, all the continental crust on Earth came together and formed one giant land mass. This land mass was surrounded by an even larger ocean, known as Mirovia. There were about four smaller continents that collided and came together to form Rodinia. This event is called the [[Grenville Orogeny]]. This caused there to be mountain building along the areas of were continents collided. This is because the continental crust is not very dense so neither continent would sink or sub duct. This causes the formation of [[Fold and thrust belt|Fold and Thrust belts]], similar to the Himalayas today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Demise ====
Rodinia lasted for 250 mya and then began to come apart between 850 and 800 mya. The continent began to break part at a single point but then fractured and ripped open in three different directions. Two of the three rifts that were created were successful and the third failed. The breaking up Rodinia caused the formation of Gondwana or Gondwanaland and Laurentia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rodinia’s breakup created many shallow coastal shelves that were not there before. The shelves were nutrient rich and this is thought to have led to the diversification of vegetative and non-vegetative life on Earth. The shelves in particular were the area where animal life is said to have started. The name Rodinia also alludes to this, in Russian it means ‘to give birth’ and in this case that is to animal life here on Earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Climate ====
The climate at the end of Rodinia’s existence was cold and it is thought that this was the start of the first snowball Earth period. Rodinia already had some glaciation but as it tore apart, less dense rock began to rise causing more land area to be at higher elevations which encouraged more ice to stick. However, the time of Rodinia was a time of inactivity in Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earth.usc.edu/~stott/Catalina/Precambrian.html|title=Precambrian Climate-Earth's Early Environment|last=|first=|date=11 June 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the atmosphere had little oxygen because Rodinia’s land surface was too harsh of an environment for land plants to flourish, the atmosphere was devoid of Oxygen and the ozone layer was much less extensive which attributed to the harsh land environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Tonian-Period|title=Tonian Period|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gondwana===

[[File:Es-Laurasia-Gondwana.png|thumb|Gondwana: Triassic Period, 200 mya]]

==== Location ====

[[Gondwana]] was located in the southern hemisphere, with the land mass that makes up current day Antarctica closest to the South Pole. The continent reaches from just above the equator to the South Pole. Current day South America and Africa are closest to the equator with Northern Africa intersecting the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_pangaea2.html|title=Earthguide: Online Classroom - Definition: Pangaea|website=earthguide.ucsd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time period ====
600-180 mya, Precambrian - Jurassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004AM/finalprogram/abstract_78645.htm|title=LINKING SUBDUCTION INITIATION, ACCRETIONARY OROGENESIS AND SUPERCONTINENT ASSEMBLY|website=gsa.confex.com|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formation ====
Gondwana was made of present-day South America, Africa, Arabia, India, Antarctica, Australia, and Madagascar. The Continent was fully formed by the late Precambrian period. This was 600 million years ago. It was an amalgamation of all the current southern hemisphere continents. Gondwana lasted through many different time periods and was a part of other super continents, like Pangea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Gondwana-supercontinent|title=Gondwana {{!}} supercontinent|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Demise ====
Gondwana broke up in distinct stages. The continent started to split during the [[Jurassic Period]] around 180 million years ago. The first event was the separation of the western half of Gondwana, which includes Africa and South America, from the eastern half, which includes Antarctica, Australia, Madagascar, and India. Next, 40 million years later, South America and Africa began to split which began to open up the Atlantic Ocean. Also around this time India and Madagascar began to detach from Australia and Antarctica, this separation created the Indian Ocean. Lastly in the Cretaceous India and Madagascar began to split and Australia and Antarctica began to detach from one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Life ====
The life on Gondwana has changed throughout its existence. Gondwana was a smaller piece of Rodinina and stayed together all the way through the breakup of Pangea. This allowed Gondwana to host almost all species that have ever lived on Earth. Gondwana also was a part of some great mass extinction events. During the [[Ordovician]], sea levels rose so much that the entire Gondwana continent was covered, at this time marine life was dominant.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/ordovician/ordolife.html|title=Life of the Ordovician|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cambrian/cambrian.php|title=The Cambrian Period|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, vertebrates started to make an appearance in the fossil record. Terrestrial species started to become more prominent in the Silurian, however, in the [[Devonian]] modern fish and shark species began to diversify, and terrestrial vegetation begun colonizing the continent, as organic soil accumulation can be detected.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/devonian/devlife.html|title=Life of the Devonian|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/silurian/silurian.php|title=The Silurian Period|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amniotic eggs started to evolve as more terrestrial land became available with rising land masses and lowering sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/cretaceous/cretlife.html|title=Life of the Cretaceous|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Permian extinction, almost all marine species were lost, along with some terrestrial species. This event gave rise to terrestrial species, such as reptiles, dinosaurs, and small mammals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Climate ====
Gondwana experienced a variety of climates as it has been a land mass from 600 million years ago in the Precambrian to the Early Jurassic with the breakup of Pangea. In the [[Cambrian]], there was a warmer and milder climate because most continental crust was closer to the equator and not the poles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The continent endured an ice age during the Ordovician period and deglaciation was still occurring during the [[Silurian]] period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The climate started to become more humid and tropical throughout the globe and there was a lack of seasonality. The climate began to change again during the [[Mesozoic]], this time period was dominated by a very large and lengthy monsoon season, because of Pangea. Once Pangea began to break apart the climate started to cool, but Gondwana was already being broken apart.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Laurentia===
[[File:North america craton nps.gif|thumb|Laurentia, in its current context.]]

==== Location ====
The location of [[Laurentia]] has changed throughout time. In the late Proterozoic Laurentia could be found surrounded by Siberia, South Africa, Australia-Antarctica, and Amazonia-Baltica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F. Hoffman|first=Paul|date=12 June 2017|title=Did the breakout of Laurentia turn Gonwanaland inside out?|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/213564802?pq-origsite=gscholar|journal=Science|volume=252|pages=1409–1412|via=|doi=10.1126/science.252.5011.1409|bibcode=1991Sci...252.1409H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurentia during the time of super contient Gondwana was smushed in between Eastern and Western Gondwana, but when Gondwana attached to Laurussia to form Pangea, laurentia was moved and was closer to northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalziel|first=Ian W.

==== Time period ====
4 bya-present day, Precambrian-Quaternary.

==== Formation ====
Laurentia is the North American craton. It is one of the largest and oldest cratons dating back to Precambrian times. The craton itself includes the Canadian and Greenland shields, as well as the interior basin of North America, and the craton can also include the Cordilleran foreland of the Southwestern United States. The [[craton]] itself formed in deep time, the early Proterozoic age of the Earth and has stayed coherent since. It formed through many different [[orogeny]]’s and the suture zones that they create. These smaller land masses were made of Archean age crust and belts of Early Proterozoic island arcs. Laurentia has been a part of many supercontinents throughout its time. The formation of Laurentia is similar to the formation of Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=P.

==== Demise ====
Laurentia is presently still coherent and still a continental craton, now it goes by the name North America. The craton can be found stretching from Alberta, Canada to the Eastern coast of both Canada and the United States. The craton stretches from the south eastern United States to Greenland. The western border of Laurentia can be found on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/North_america_craton_nps.gif/300px-North_america_craton_nps.gif|title=North American Craton|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life ====
Sea level rose in the [[Cambrian]] period which gave rise to marine invertebrates which flourished with the rise in sea level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Life in the Ordovician continued to be dominated by marine animals and vegetation. Also, vertebrates started to make up a portion of the animals on Earth. However sponges and algae were still the most dominant species type. Marine animals were the most dominant but terrestrial species started to appear at the end of the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Life in the Silurian was still dominated by marine species but terrestrial species are much more prominent than they had been previously.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When Laurentia moved into the Devonian period fish began to diversify and life had begun colonizing land as this is when organic soil accumulation can be detected. More modern fish began to develop as time went on, with the addition of shark diversification. Also, amniotic eggs started to evolve as more terrestrial land became available with rising land masses.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The next event was the Permian extinction where almost all species in the oceans died off along with many terrestrial species. This then gave rise to terrestrial animals, such as reptiles, dinosaurs, and small mammals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; At the end of this new era was a mass extinction of Dinosaurs and reptiles, this led mammals to flourish as they could take over many of the niches that became vacant.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/cretaceous/cretaceous.php|title=The Cretaceous Period|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate ====
Laurentia experienced a variety of climates as it has been a land mass for billions of years. The craton experienced an ice age during the late Proterozoic and another during the Ordivician period. During the Cambrian, there was no ice age and it was slightly warmer as most continents avoided the poles giving land at this time a milder climate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Deglaciation was still occurring during the Silurian period after the ice age of the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The climate started to move to become more humid and tropical throughout the Earth. There weren’t many seasons. The climate began to change when Laurentia entered the Mesozoic Era, this time period was dominated by a very large and lengthy monsoon season, because of Pangea.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At the end of the Cretaceous, seasons started to return and the Earth entered another ice age type event.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Pangea===
[[File:Pangea continents and oceans.svg|thumb|Pangea]]

==== Location ====
The continent spanned from 85° N to 90° S. [[Pangea]] was centered over the equator, and encompassed area from the North to the South poles.  The Southeastern part of present-day North America and the Northern region of current day Africa intersected the equator. Present-day Eastern Asia was furthest North and Antarctica and Australia were furthest South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/pangaea-present-lesson-2|title=Pangaea to the Present Lesson #2 {{!}} Volcano World {{!}} Oregon State University|website=volcano.oregonstate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time period ====
299–272 mya to 200 mya, Early Permian-Early Jurassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Pangea|title=Pangea {{!}} supercontinent|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formation ====
Pangea was created by the continent of Gondwanaland and the continent of Laurussia. During the Carboniferous period the two continents came together to form the supercontinent of Pangea. The mountain building events that happened at this time created the Appalachian Mountains and the Variscan Belt of Central Europe. However, not all landmasses on Earth had attached themselves onto Pangea. It took until the late Permian until the Siberian land mass collided with Pangea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torsvik|first=T. H.|last2=van der Voo|first2=R.|last3=Cocks|first3=L. R. M.|date=2003-04-01|title=Formation of Pangea|pages=2179|bibcode=2003EAEJA.....2179T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only land mass to not be a part of Pangea were the former North and South China plates, they created a much smaller land mass in the ocean. There was a massive ocean that encompassed the world called Panthalassa, because most of the continental crust was sutured together into one giant continent there was a giant ocean to match.

==== Demise ====
Pangea broke apart after 70 million years. The supercontinent was torn apart through fragmentation, which is where parts of the main landmass would break off in stages.  There were two main events that led to the dispersal of Pangea. The first was a passive rifting event that occurred in the Triassic period. This rifting event caused the Atlantic Ocean to form. The other event was an active rifting event. This happened in the Lower Jurassic and caused the opening of the Indian Ocean.This breakup took 17 million years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frizon de Lamotte|first=Dominique|last2=Fourdan|first2=Brendan|last3=Leleu|first3=Sophie|last4=Leparmentier|first4=François|last5=de Clarens|first5=Philippe|date=2015-05-01|title=Style of rifting and the stages of Pangea breakup|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014TC003760/abstract|journal=Tectonics|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=2014TC003760|doi=10.1002/2014TC003760|issn=1944-9194|bibcode=2015Tecto..34.1009F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bortolotti|first=Valerio|last2=Principi|first2=Gianfranco|date=2005-12-01|title=Tethyan ophiolites and Pangea break-up|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1738.2005.00478.x/abstract|journal=Island Arc|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=442–470|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1738.2005.00478.x|issn=1440-1738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life ====
Pangea formed roughly 20 million years before the Permian Extinction. During the Permian Extinction over 95% of all marine species were lost and 70% of terrestrial species were lost.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Permian-extinction|title=Permian Extinction|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Triassic period of Pangea became a time of recovery from the Permian Extinction. This recovery included the rise of sea levels which created extensive shallow oceanic shelves for large marine reptiles. This recovery period was when terrestrial animals flourished and when land reptiles diversified and flourished, along with the appearance of Dinosaurs. These Dinosaurs would become what characterizes the life forms of the following periods, the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Lastly at the end of the Triassic and the beginning of the Jurassic was the first appearance of small shrew like mammals that came from reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Triassic-Period|title=Triassic Period|last=|first=|date=11 June 2017|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The main characteristic of Pangea’s climate is that its position on Earth was advantageous for starting a cycle of megamonsoonal circulation. The monsoons reached their maximum strength in the Triassic period of the Mesozoic. During the late Carboniferous, there was peat formation in what is currently Europe and the Eastern areas of North America. The wetter, swamp like conditions needed to form peat were contrasted with the dry conditions on the Colorado Plateau. Nearing the end of the Carboniferous the region of Pangea centered on the equator became drier. In the Permian, this dryness was contrasted with seasonal rainfall, and this type of climate became more normal and widespread on the continent. However, during the Triassic, the Colorado Plateau started to regain some moisture and there was a shift in wind direction. Around the same time parts of current day Australia that were found at higher latitudes were much drier and seasonal in character. At the start of the Jurassic the megamonsoon started to fall apart as drying started to happen to Gondwana and the southern portion of Laurasia.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T Parrish|first=Judith|date=11 June 2017|title=Climate of the Supercontinent Pangea|jstor=30081148|journal=The Journal of Geology|volume=101|pages=215–233|via=|doi=10.1086/648217|bibcode=1993JG....101..215P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poa pratensis''''', commonly known as '''Kentucky bluegrass''' (or '''blue grass'''), '''smooth meadow-grass''', or '''common meadow-grass''', is a [[perennial]] species of [[Poaceae|grass]] native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America. The Spanish brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/turf/publications/Bluegrass.html|title=Kentucky Bluegrass |publisher=Aggie Horticulture|author=Martin Anderson, Texas AgriLife Extension Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poa pratensis'' forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making [[lawn]]s in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ksenija Vujnovic |author2=Ross W. Wein |date=September 1997 |title=An Inventory of Remnant Prairie Grasslands Within the Central Parkland Natural Sub-Region of Alberta |url=https://www.albertaparks.ca/media/3195225/parkland_report_remnant_prairie.pdf |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Poa pratensis'' was one of the many species described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his landmark work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753. ''Poa'' is [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] for [[fodder]] and ''pratensis'' is derived from ''pratum'', the [[Latin]] for [[meadow]]. The name Kentucky bluegrass derives from its flower heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dag Ryen (letter to the editor) |date=June 3, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/l-what-makes-kentucky-s-bluegrass-blue-528593.html |title=What Makes Kentucky's Bluegrass Blue |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=22 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Poa pratensis'' is the [[type (botany)|type species]] of the grass family [[Poaceae]].

There are two ill-defined subspecies:
*''Poa pratensis'' [[ssp.]] ''pratensis'' – temperate regions
*''Poa pratensis'' ssp. ''colpodea'' – Arctic

==Description==
''Poa pratensis'' is a [[herbaceous]] perennial plant {{convert|30|–|70|cm}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] have boat-shaped tips, narrowly linear, up to {{convert|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|3|–|5|mm}} broad, smooth or slightly roughened, with a rounded to truncate ligule {{convert|1|–|2|mm}} long. The conical [[panicle]] is {{convert|5|–|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long, with 3 to 5 branches in the basal whorls; the oval [[spikelet]]s are {{convert|3|–|6|mm}} long with 2 to 5 [[floret]]s, and are purplish-green or grey. They are in flower from May to July, compared to annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') which is in flower for eight months of the year. ''Poa pratensis'' has a fairly prominent mid-vein (center of the blade).

The [[ligule]] is extremely short and square ended, making a contrast with annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') and rough meadowgrass (''[[Poa trivialis]]'') in which it is silvery and pointed. The Kentucky bluegrass is a dark green/blue compared to the apple-green color of ''Poa annua'' and ''Poa trivialis''.

The [[rootstock]] is creeping, with runners ([[rhizome]]s). The broad, blunt leaves tend to spread at the base, forming close mats.

==Cultivation and production==
Since the 1950s and early 1960s, 90% of Kentucky bluegrass seed in the United States has been produced on specialist farms in [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

During the 1990s botanists began experimenting with hybrids of ''Poa pratensis'' and Texas bluegrass (''[[Poa arachnifera|P. arachnifera]]''), with the goal of creating a [[drought]] and heat-resistant lawn grass.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''Post-classical history''' (also called the '''Post-Antiquity era''', '''Post-Ancient Era''', or '''Pre-Modern Era''') is a [[periodization]] commonly used by the school of "[[world history]]" instead of [[Middle Ages]] (Medieval), which is roughly synonymous.&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt; The period runs from about AD 500 to 1450 though there may be regional differences and debates. The era was globally characterized by the expansion of civilizations geographically, the development of three of the great world religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism), and development of networks of trade between civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf The Post‐Classical Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031011114/http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }} by Joel Hermansen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt;

In Asia, the [[spread of Islam]] created a [[Caliphate|new empire]] and [[Islamic Golden Age]] with trade between the [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an continents, and advances in [[science in the medieval Islamic world]]. [[East Asia]] experienced the full establishment of power of [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], which established several prosperous dynasties influencing Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] spread. [[Gunpowder]] was originally developed in China during the post-classical era. The [[Mongol Empire]] connected Europe and Asia creating safe trade and stability between the two regions. In total the [[World population estimates|population of the world]] doubled in the time period from approximately 210 million in AD 500 to 461 million in 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein Goldewijk|first=Kees|last2=Beusen|first2=Arthur|last3=Janssen|first3=Peter|date=2010-03-22|title=Long-term dynamic modeling of global population and built-up area in a spatially explicit way: HYDE 3.1|journal=The Holocene|volume=20|issue=4|pages=565–573|doi=10.1177/0959683609356587|issn=0959-6836|bibcode=2010Holoc..20..565K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population generally grew steadily throughout the period but endured some incidental declines in events including the [[Plague of Justinian]], [[Mongol invasions and conquests|The Mongol Invasions]] and the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name="Haub1650"&gt;Haub (1995): "The average annual rate of growth was actually lower from 1 A.D. to 1650 than the rate suggested above for the 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. period. One reason for this abnormally slow growth was the Black Plague. This dreaded scourge was not limited to 14th century Europe. The epidemic may have begun about 542 A.D. in Western Asia, spreading from there. It is believed that half the Byzantine Empire was destroyed in the 6th century, a total of 100 million deaths."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
===Terminology and periodization===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] was a Renaissance historian who helped develop the concept of the Middle Ages.]]
'Post-classical history' is a [[periodization]] used by historians employing a "[[world history]]" approach to history, specifically the school developed during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns&gt;{{cite book |editor=R. Charles Weller |title=21st-Century Narratives of World History: Global and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |publisher=Palgrave |chapter=Periodization in World History: Challenges and Opportunities |last=Stearns |first=Peter N. |authorlink=Peter N. Stearns |year=2017 |page= |isbn=978-3319620770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of world history, the term is also sometimes used to avoid erroneous pre-conceptions around the terms "Middle Ages", "Medieval" and "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" (see [[medievalism]]).

The post-classical period corresponds roughly to the period from 500 to 1450 CE.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Beginning and ending dates might vary depending on the region, with the period beginning at the end of the previous classical period: [[End of the Han Dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651).

The post-classical period is one of the five or six major periods world historians use: (1) early civilization; (2) [[Ancient history|classical societies]]; (3) post-classical; (4) [[early modern]]; (5) [[long nineteenth century]]; and (6) [[Modern history|contemporary or modern era]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; (Sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt;) Although ''post-classical'' is synonymous with the [[Middle Ages]] of Western Europe, the term ''post-classical'' is not necessarily a member of the traditional [[Late Middle Ages#Historiography and periodization|tripartite periodisation]] of Western European history into 'classical', 'middle' and 'modern'.

===Approaches===
The historical field of [[world history]], which looks at common themes occurring across multiple cultures and regions, has enjoyed extensive development since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1–14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, World History research has tended to focus on [[early modern globalization]] (beginning around 1500) and subsequent developments, and views post-classical history as mainly pertaining to [[Afro-Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Historians recognize the difficulties of creating a periodization and identifying common themes that include not only this region but also, for example, the Americas, since they had little contact with Afro-Eurasia before the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Thus recent research has emphasised that 'a global history of the period between 500 and 1500 is still wanting' and that 'historians have only just begun to embark on a global history of the Middle Ages'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many regions of the world, there are well established histories. Although [[Medieval Studies]] in Europe tended in the nineteenth century to focus on creating histories for individual nation-states, much twentieth-century research focused, successfully, on creating an integrated history of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamicate world likewise has a rich regional historiography, ranging from the fourteenth-century [[Ibn Khaldun]] to the twentieth-century [[Marshall Hodgson]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Silverstein, ''Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 94-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, research into the network of commercial hubs which enabled goods and ideas to move between China in the East and the Atlantic islands in the West—which can be called the [[Archaic globalization|early history of globalisation]]—is fairly advanced; one key historian in this field is [[Janet Abu-Lughod]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [81-83].&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding of communication within sub-saharan Africa or the Americas is, by contrast, far more limited.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [80-81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent history-writing, therefore, has begun to explore how it might be possible meaningfully to write history that spans the Old World, where human activities were fairly interconnected, and establishes its relationship with other worlds, such as the Americas and Oceania. In the assessment of [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]], [[John Darwin (historian)|John Darwin]], [[Margret Frenz]], and [[Chris Wickham]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;Global history may be boundless, but global historians are not. Global history cannot usefully mean the history of everything, everywhere, all the time. [...] Three approaches [...] seem to us to have real promise. One is global history as the pursuit of significant historical problems across time, space, and specialism. This can sometimes be characterized as [[comparative history|‘comparative’ history]]. [...] Another is connectedness, including transnational relationships. [...] The third approach is the study of globalization [...]. Globalization is a term that needs to be rescued from the present, and salvaged for the past. To define it as always encompassing the whole planet is to mistake the current outcome for a very ancient process.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, John Darwin, and Chris Wickham, 'Introduction: The Prospect of Global History', in ''The Prospect of Global History'', ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 3–22 [3] {{DOI|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732259.001.0001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A number of commentators have pointed to the history of the earth's [[climate]] as a useful approach to World History in the Middle Ages, noting that certain climate events had effects on all human populations.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Atwell, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078878 Volcanism and Short-Term Climatic Change in East Asian and World History, c. 1200-1699]', ''Journal of World History'', 12.1 (Spring 2001), 29-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet, ''Cotton, Climate, and Camels in Early Islamic Iran: A Moment in World History'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|978-0231519878}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Ellenblum, ''The Collapse of the Eastern Mediterranean: Climate Change and the Decline of the East, 950-1072'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''Climate Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1139050814}}, {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9781139050814}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main trends==

The Post-classical era saw several common developments or themes. There was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas; the rise and/or spread of the three major world, or missionary, religions; and a period of rapidly expanding trade and trade networks.

=== Growth of civilization ===
{{Main|Civilization}}[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 54.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Nazca culture]] which produced the [[Nazca Lines]] were one of South America's Andean Civilizations thriving from the 1st to the 8th century. Photograph by Diego Delso. ]]
First was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas across [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Mesoamerica]], and western [[South America]]. However, as noted by world historian [[Peter N. Stearns]], there were no common global political trends during the post-classical period, rather it was a period of loosely organized states and other developments, but no common political patterns emerged.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; In Asia, China continued its historic [[dynastic cycle]] and became more complex, improving its bureaucracy. The creation of the Islamic Empires established a new power in the Middle East, North Africa, and [[Central Asia]]. Africa created the [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] and [[Mali Empire|Mali]] kingdoms in the West. The fall of Roman civilization not only left a power vacuum for the Mediterranean and Europe, but forced certain areas to build what some historians might call new civilizations entirely.{{sfn|Birken|1992|pages=451–461}} An entirely different political system was applied in Western Europe (i.e. [[feudalism]]), as well as a different society (i.e. [[manorialism]]). But the once East Roman Empire, Byzantium, retained many features of old Rome, as well as Greek and Persian similarities. Kiev Rus' and subsequently Russia began development in Eastern Europe as well. In the isolated Americas, Mesoamerica saw the building of the [[Aztec]] Empire, while the Andean region of South America saw the establishment of the [[Inca Empire]].

=== Spread of universal religions ===
{{Main|History of religion}}
[[File:Siege of Acre.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|Siege of Acre (1191)]], religious wars were common in Post-classical times. One of the largest of such wars were the [[Crusades]]. Picture dated from 1280.|200x200px]]
Religion that envisaged the possibility that all humans could be included in a universal order had emerged already in the first millennium BC, particularly with Buddhism. In the following millennium, Buddhism was joined by two other major, universalising, missionary religions, both developing from [[Judaism]]: Christianity and Islam. By the end of the period, these three religions were between them widespread, and often politically dominant, across the Old World.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'', trans. by Yuval Noah Harari, John Purcell and Haim Watzman (London: Harvill Secker, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1846558238|978-1846558245}}, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buddhism]] spread from India into China and flourished there briefly before using it as a hub to spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam;{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} a similar effect occurred with Confucian revivalism in the later centuries.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"/&gt;
* [[Christianity]] had become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, and continued spreading into northern and eastern Europe during the post-classical period at the expense of belief systems that Christians labelled [[Paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} An attempt was even made to incur upon the Middle East during the [[Crusades]]. The split of the [[Catholic Church]] in Western Europe and the [[Orthodox Church]] in Eastern Europe encouraged religious and cultural diversity in Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Fletcher |title=The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity, 371-1386 AD |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islam]] began between 610 and 632, with a series of revelations to [[Muhammad]]. It helped unify the warring [[Bedouin]] clans of the Arabian peninsula and, through a rapid series of [[Muslim conquests]], became established to the west across [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|North Africa]], the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]], and parts of [[Islam in Africa|West Africa]], and to the east across [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]], [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang|Central Asia]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], and [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam J. |last=Silverstein |title=Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0199545728 |pages=9–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade and communication ===
{{Main|Trade route}}
[[File:Rakaposhi View from Babusar Top.jpg|left|thumb| [[Babusar Pass]] in [[Pakistan]], part of the wider [[Silk Road]] network of overland routes. Image provided by Attabik Awan.]]
Finally, communication and trade across [[Afro-Eurasia]] increased rapidly. The [[Silk Road]] continued to spread cultures and ideas through trade and throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trade networks were established between West Europe, Byzantium, early Russia, the Islamic Empires, and the [[Far East]]ern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|title=Environment and Trade: The Viking Age|publisher=Khan Academy|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005514/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|archive-date=2018-06-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa the earlier introduction of the Camel allowed for a new and eventually large [[Trans-Saharan trade]] which connected Sub-Saharan West Africa to Eurasia. The Islamic Empires adopted many Greek, Roman, and Indian advances and spread them through the Islamic sphere of influence, allowing these developments to reach Europe, North and West Africa, and Central Asia. Islamic sea trade helped connect these areas, including those in the [[Indian Ocean]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], replacing Byzantium in the latter region. The Christian Crusades into the Middle East (as well as Muslim Spain and [[Sicily]]) brought Islamic science, technology, and goods to Western Europe.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} Western trade into East Asia was pioneered by [[Marco Polo]]. Importantly, China began the sinicization (or Chinese influence) of regions like Japan,{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} Korea, and Vietnam through trade and conquest. Finally, the growth of the [[Mongol Empire]] in Central Asia established safe trade such as to allow goods, cultures, ideas, and disease to spread between Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Americas had their own trade network, however theirs was limited by the lack of draft animals and the wheel. In [[Oceania]] some of the island chains of [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] also engaged in trade with one another.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Historical climatology|Little Ice Age}}During Post-Classical times, there is evidence that many regions of the world were affected similarly by global climate conditions however, direct effects in temperature and precipitation varied by region. According to [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] changes did not all occur sanctimoniously at once. Generally however studies found that temperatures were relatively warmer, in the eleventh century, but colder by the early seventeenth century. It is uncertain the degree of climate change which occurred in all regions across the world, and whether such changes were all part of a global trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb09climatology/files/2012/03/Pages_2013_NatureGeo.pdf |title=Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=339 |date=2013-04-21 |doi=10.1038/NGEO1797|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..339P |last1=Ahmed |first1=Moinuddin |last2=Anchukaitis |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Asrat |first3=Asfawossen |last4=Borgaonkar |first4=Hemant P. |last5=Braida |first5=Martina |last6=Buckley |first6=Brendan M. |last7=Büntgen |first7=Ulf |last8=Chase |first8=Brian M. |last9=Christie |first9=Duncan A. |last10=Cook |first10=Edward R. |last11=Curran |first11=Mark A.J. |last12=Diaz |first12=Henry F. |last13=Esper |first13=Jan |last14=Fan |first14=Ze-Xin |last15=Gaire |first15=Narayan P. |last16=Ge |first16=Quansheng |last17=Gergis |first17=Joëlle |last18=González-Rouco |first18=J.

There are climate periods that could be roughly said to account for large scale climate trends in the Post Classical Period. These include the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]], the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. The [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|Extreme Weather Events of 536–537]] were likely initiated by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Lake llopango caldera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Sulfate emitted into the air initiated global cooling, migrations and crop failures worldwide possibly intensifying an already cooler time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160208112918.htm|title=Old trees reveal Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) around 1,500 years ago|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that the world's temperature remained colder on average for at least a century afterwards.

The [[Medieval Warm Period|Medieval Warming Period]] from 950–1250 occurred mostly throughout the northern hemisphere causing many areas to have warmer summers, the high temperatures would only be surpassed by the Global Warming of the 20th/21st centuries. It has been hypothesized that the warm of temperatures allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland, due to ice-free waters at the time. Outside of Europe there is evidence of warming conditions, including higher temperatures in China and major North American droughts which adversely effected numerous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/TimeSeriesDisplay.aspx|title=Drought Congruence 1000-1300, Central United States|last=|first=|date=2010|website=North American Drought Atlas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1250, glaciers began to expand in Greenland effecting its [[Thermohaline circulation]], cooling the entire North Atlantic. In the 14th century, the growing season in Europe became unreliable, meanwhile in China the cultivation of Oranges were driven southward by colder temperatures. Especially in Europe, the Little Ice Age had large cultural ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eh-resources.org/timeline-middle-ages/|title=Timeline Middle Ages and Early Modern Period – Environmental History Resources|work=Environmental History Resources|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Little Ice Age]] would persist until the industrial revolution, far beyond the time-frame of the Post Classical Period.&lt;ref name="Hendy2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hendy | first1 = E.| last2 = Gagan | first2 = M.| last3 = Alibert | first3 = C.| last4 = McCulloch | first4 = M.| last5 = Lough | first5 = J.| last6 = Isdale | first6 = P.| title = Abrupt decrease in tropical Pacific sea surface salinity at end of Little Ice Age| journal = Science| volume = 295| issue = 5559| pages = 1511–1514| year = 2002| pmid = 11859191| doi = 10.1126/science.1067693|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1511H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes for the little Ice-Age are unclear, possible explanations include [[Solar maximum|sunspots]], [[Earth's orbit|orbital cycles of the Earth]], [[Volcano|volcanic activity]], [[Thermohaline circulation|ocean circulation]], and man made [[population decline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira_research/Pongratz_Caldeira.html|title=Carnegie Department of Global Ecology|website=dge.carnegiescience.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Postclassical Era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the [[Caliphate|Arabian Empires]].

In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated by empires and their spheres of influence; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Outline of History|last=Wells|first=H.G|publisher=Garden City Publishing Inc|year=1920|isbn=|location=Garden City, NUY|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.

While the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the Turkic-based [[Seljuq Empire]].
After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.

The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions.

In 1401, the region was further plagued by the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turko-Mongol]], [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

During the Postclassical Era, [[Africa]] was both culturally and politically affected by the introduction of Islam and the Arabic empires.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=184}} This was especially true in the north, the [[Sudan region]], and the east coast.

These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety of ways. Most of these peoples practiced spiritual, animistic religions. Africa was culturally separated between Saharan Africa (which consisted of [[North Africa]] and the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]) and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (everything south of the Sahara). Sub-Saharan Africa was further divided into the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], which covered everything north of [[Central Africa]], including [[West Africa]]. The area south of the Sudan was primarily occupied by the [[Bantu peoples]] who spoke the [[Bantu language]]. From 1100 onward [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] and the [[Islamic World]] became dependent on Africa for gold.

'''Sub Saharan Africa'''

After 650 approximately urbanization expanded for the first time beyond the ancient kingdoms [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] and [[Nubia]]. The Precolonial civilizations of African Civilization can be divided into three categories based on religion.  (1) Christian Civilizations on the [[Horn of Africa]] (2) Islamic Civilizations which formed in the Niger River valley in West Africa, and on the coast of East Africa and (3) Traditional Societies which adhered to native African Religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/sub-saharan-africa/#age-of-pre-colonial-civilization|title=History of Sub-Saharan Africa {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of the Sahara African kingdoms developed based on continental trade with one another through land based routes and generally avoided sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Atlas of World History|editor-last=Barraclough|editor-first=Geoffrey|publisher=Borders Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0681502888|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub Saharan Africa was part of two large, separate trading networks, the Trans Saharan trade which bridged commerce between West and North Africa.

There has been difficulty applying the word 'medieval' or 'post classical' to the history of South Asia. This section follows historian Stein Burton's definition that corresponds from the 8th century to the 16th century, more of less following the same time frame of the Post Classical Period and the European Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stein|first=Burton|author-link=Burton Stein|editor-last=Arnold|editor-first=D.|date=27 April 2010|title=A History of India|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-1405195096|page=105|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 13th century, there was no less than 20 to 40 different states on the Indian Subcontinent which hosted a variety of cultures, languages, writing systems and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: A History|last=Keay|first=John|authorlink=John Keay|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2000|pages=xx–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the time period [[Buddhism]] was predominant throughout the area with the short lived [[Pala Empire]] on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo Gangetic Plain]] sponsoring the faith's institutions. One such institution was the Buddhist [[Nalanda University]] in modern-day [[Bihar|Bihar, India]] was a center of scholarship and brought a divided South Asia onto the global intellectual stage.

In Southern India, the [[Hindu]] Kingdom of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] gained prominence with an overseas empire that controlled parts of modern-day Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|Indonesia]] as oversees territories and helped spread Hinduism into the historic culture of these places.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Asia'' by B.V. Rao p.211&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period, neighboring areas such as [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[History of Tibet|Tibet]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] were under [[Greater India|South Asian influence]].

From 1206 onward a series of [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Islamic invasions]] based from modern day Afghanistan and Iran conquered massive portions of Northern India, founding the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultante]] which remained supreme until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history : cultures, states, and societies to 1500|publisher=|others=Berger, Eugene., Israel, George L., Miller, Charlotte., Parkinson, Brian (Brian R.), Reeves, Andrew., Williams, Nadejda.|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=107|oclc=961216293|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George L.|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delhi Sultanate introduced Islam to the conquered populations for the first time. Native religions fared differently, [[Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent|Buddhism declined]] in South Asia vanishing in many areas but Hinduism survived and reinforced itself in areas conquered by [[Hindu–Islamic relations|Muslims]]. In the far South the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijanyagar]] was not conquered by any Muslim state in the period. The turn of the 16th century would see the rise of a new Islamic Empire – the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the establishment of European trade posts by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]].

Built in the 9th century Borobudur is the largest Buddhist Temple in the world.|alt=|left]]From the 8th century onward Southeast Asia stood to benefit from the trade taking place between South and East Asia, numerous kingdoms arose in the region due to the flow of wealth passing through the [[Strait of Malacca]]. While Southeast Asia had numerous outside influences [[Greater India|India]] was the greatest source of inspiration for the region.  North Vietnam as an exception was culturally closer to China for centuries due to conquest.

Since rule from the third century BC North Vietnam continued to be subjugated by Chinese states, although they continually resisted periodically. There were three periods of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese Domination]] that spanned near 1100 years. Vietnam gained long lasting independence in the 10th century when China was [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|divided]].  Nonetheless even as an independent state a sort of begrudging [[sinicization]] occurred. By the end of the Postclassical Era, Vietnam would be in control of its own [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. South Vietnam was governed by  the ancient Hindu [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] but was annexed by [[Cham–Annamese War|Vietnamese invaders]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=annam+sacked+their+country+vietnamese+smashed+champa+cham+officials+told+the+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=annam%20sacked%20their%20country%20vietnamese%20smashed%20champa%20cham%20officials%20told%20the%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur|first=Ben|last=Kiernan|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|location=|page=110|isbn=978-0300144253|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and maritime trade between China and [[South Asia]] created the foundation for Southeast Asia's first major empires; including the [[Khmer Empire]] from Cambodia and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] from Indonesia. During the Khmer Empire's height in the 12th century the city of [[Angkor Thom]] was among the largest of the pre-modern world due to its water management. [[Jayavarman II|King Jayavarman II]] constructed over a hundred hospitals throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia|first=George|last=Cœdès|isbn=978-0824803681|location=Honolulu|oclc=961876784|year=1968|publisher=East-West Center Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby rose the [[Pagan Empire]] in modern-day Burma, using elephants as military might.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=211|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Buddhist [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and its tolerance for believers of older polytheistic gods helped  [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] become supreme in the region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In Indonesia, [[Srivijaya]] from the 7th through 14th century was a [[Thalassocracy]] that focused on maritime city states and trade. Controlling the vital choke points of the [[Sunda Strait|Sunda]] and [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca straits]] it became rich from trade ranging from Japan through Arabia. Gold, Ivory and Ceramics were all major commodities traveling through port cities. The Empire was also responsible for the construction of wonders such as [[Borobudur]]. During this time Indonesian sailors crossed the [[Indian Ocean]]; evidence suggests that they may have colonized [[History of Madagascar|Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/madagascar-women-120320.html |title=Madagascar Founded By Women  |publisher=Discovery.com|date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian culture spread to the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Philippines]], likely through Indonesian trade resulting in the first documented use of writing in the archipelago and [[Indianized kingdom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time changing economic and political conditions else where and wars weakened the traditional empires of South East Asia. While the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol Invasions]] did not directly annex Southeast Asia the war-time devastation paved way for the rise of new nations. In the 15th century the Khmer Empire was supplanted by the Thai [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] was overtaken by the [[Majapahit]] and later the Islamic [[Malacca Sultanate]] by 1450.

The Mongol Empire which existed during the 13th and 14th centuries, was the largest [[List of largest empires#Largest empires by land area and population|continuous land empire]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan. ''The Mongols''. p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]], the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Sea of Japan]], extending northwards into [[Siberia]], eastwards and southwards into the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Indochina]], and the [[Iranian plateau]], and westwards as far as the [[Levant]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=234|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the [[Mongolia]] homeland under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and then under his descendants, who sent [[Mongol invasions|invasions]] in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond.

''Culture and Conquest''. p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], or one of his other sons such as [[Tolui]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], or [[Jochi]]. After [[Möngke Khan]] died, rival ''[[kurultai]]'' councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers [[Ariq Böke]] and [[Kublai Khan]], who then not only fought each other in the [[Toluid Civil War]], but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Biran |title=Qaidu and the Rise of the Independent Mongol State in Central Asia |publisher=The Curzon Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0700706310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatayid]] and [[House of Ögedei|Ögedeid]] families.

The Chinese style stamp was used outside China as the official symbol of the Khans and their messengers|alt=]]The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260 marked the high-water point of the [[Mongol conquests]] and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield. Though the Mongols launched many more invasions into the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors.

By the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the [[Golden Horde]] khanate in the northwest; the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the west; the [[Ilkhanate]] in the southwest; and the [[Yuan dynasty]] based in modern-day [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="China p413"&gt;''The Cambridge History of China: Alien Regimes and Border States''. p.&amp;nbsp;413.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson.

Descendants of [[Chagatai Khan]] created the [[Mughal Empire]] that ruled much of India in [[Early modern period|early modern]] times.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===The Silk Road===
{{main|History of Central Asia|History of Siberia|Silk Road}}[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|left|thumb|Central Asian Buddhist Monks, the Silk Road allowed for the exchange for ideas as well as goods. A Caucasian looking [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher possibly [[Sogdia]]n instructs an East-Asian monk. Dated from the 9th century near [[Turpan|Turfan, Xinxiang, China]] |214x214px]]
The Silk Road was a Eurasian trade route that played a large role in global communication and interaction. It stimulated cultural exchange; encouraged the learning of new languages; resulted in the trade of many goods, such as silk, gold, and spices; and also spread religion and disease.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} It is even claimed by some historians – such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[William Hardy McNeill]], [[Jerry H. Bentley]], and [[Marshall Hodgson]] – that the Afro-Eurasian world was loosely united culturally, and that the Silk Road was fundamental to this unity.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} This major trade route began with the [[Han dynasty]] of China, connecting it to the Roman Empire and any regions in between or nearby. At this time, Central Asia exported horses, [[wool]], and [[jade]] into China for the latter's silk; the Romans would trade for the Chinese commodity as well, offering wine in return.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=101}} The Silk Road would often decline and rise again in trade from the Iron Age to the Postclassical Era. Following one such decline, it was reopened in Central Asia by [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Ban Chao]] during the 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The Silk Road was also a major factor in spreading religion across Afro-Eurasia. Muslim teachings from Arabia and [[Persia]] reached East Asia. Buddhism spread from India, to China, to Central Asia. One significant development in the spread of Buddhism was the carving of the [[Gandhara]] School in the cities of [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] and the [[Peshwar]], allegedly in the mid 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The route was vulnerable to spreading plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] originated in East Asia and had a major outbreak in Europe in 542 causing the deaths of a quarter of the Mediterranean's population. Trade between Europe, Africa and Asia along the route was at least partially responsible for spreading the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/|title=Justinian's Plague (541–542 CE)|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular theory that the Black Death was caused by the Mongol conquests. The claim is that the direct link that it opened between the East and West provided the path for rats and fleas that carried the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780691135892|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no concrete historical evidence to this theory, the plague is considered endemic on the steppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction|last=Milward|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199782864|location=Oxford|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were vulnerabilities as well to changing political situations. The rise of Islam changed the Silk Road, because Muslim rulers generally closed the Silk Road to [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] to an extent Europe would be cut off from Asia for centuries. Specifically, the political developments that affected the Silk Road included the emergence of the Turks, the political movements of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires, and the rise of the Arabs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|last2=Sims-Williams|first2=Ursula|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1932476121|location=Chicago, IL|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Song Tapestry.jpg|thumb|Chinese-Song-era tapestry, Chinese Silk was carried west over large distances and sold for large profits.|alt=Chinese-Song era tapestry|264x264px]]

The Silk Road flourished again in the 13th century during the reign of the Mongol Empire, which through conquest had brought stability in Central Asia comparable to the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=146|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by a Muslim historian that Central Asia was peaceful and safe to transverse &lt;blockquote&gt;"(Central Asia) enjoyed such a peace that a man might have journeyed from the land of sunrise to the land of sunset with a golden platter upon his head without suffering the least violence from anyone."{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, trade and communication between Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East required little effort. Handicraft production, art, and scholarship prospered, and wealthy merchants enjoyed cosmopolitan cities.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Silk Road trade played a role in spreading the infamous [[Black Death]]. Originating in China, the [[bubonic plague]] was spread by Mongol warriors catapulting diseased corpses into enemy towns in the [[Crimea]]. The disease, spread by rats, was carried by merchant ships sailing across the Mediterranean that brought the plague back to Sicily, causing an [[epidemic]] in 1347.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=310}} Nevertheless, after the 15th century, the Silk Road disappeared from regular use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was primarily a result from the growing sea travel pioneered by Europeans, which allowed the trade of goods by sailing around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Westerner and Arab practicing geometry 15th century manuscript.jpg|left|thumb|Westerner and Arab practicing geometry 15th century manuscript]]
The term ''Post Classical Science'' is often used in Academic Circles and in college courses to combine the study of [[European science in the Middle Ages|Medieval European Science]] and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Medieval Islamic Science]] due to their interactions with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0036_postClassicalScience.html|title=Outline – Post-Classical Science – History of Science Study Guide – Dr Robert A.

The Islamic World also benefited from medical knowledge from [[Indian influence on Islamic science|South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of Medicine: Byzantine and Islamic medicine By Plinio Prioreschi Vol. iv,  p. 121, {{ISBN|1-888456-02-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the Western World and in Islamic realms much emphasis was placed on preserving the rationalist Greek Tradition of figures such as [[Aristotle]]. In the context of science within Islam there is a debate as to whether Islamic Scientists simply preserved accomplishments from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or built upon earlier Greek advances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1945) ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', book 2, part 2, chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdus Salam]], H.R.

World Scientific, {{ISBN|9971507137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Classical European Science was brought back to the Christian Kingdoms due to the experience of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="WorldHistp451" /&gt;

As a result of Persian trade in China, and the battle of the [[Battle of Talas|Talas River]], Chinese innovations entered the Islamic Intellectual World. These include advances in astronomy and in [[History of paper|paper-making.]]

=== Literate Culture and Arts ===
{{main|History of literature|History of art|History of music}}
[[File:Genji emaki sekiya.jpg|thumb|12th century illustration from the ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Gengji]]'', the world's first novel.]]

[[File:Ut Queant Laxis.ogg|left|thumb|Italy, 8th century ''Ut Queant Laxis'']]
Within Eurasia, there were four major civilization groups that had literate cultures and created literature and arts. These include Europe, The Middle East, South Asia and East
Asia. Southeast Asia could be a possible fifth category but was influenced heavily from both South and East Asia literal cultures. All four cultures in Post-Classical Times used [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[prose]]. Throughout the period and until the 19th century poetry was the dominant form of literary expression. In the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and China great poetic works often used figurative language. Examples include, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Shakuntala]]'', the [[Arabic]] ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Thousand and one nights]]'', [[Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]] '' and works by the Chinese [[Du Fu]]. In Japan, prose uniquely thrived more than in other geographic areas. The ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is considered the world's first realistic novel written in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/world-literature-music/|title=World Literature and Music {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, most regions of the world only used [[Melody|melodies]] as opposed to [[harmony]]. Medieval Europe was the lone exception to this rule, developing harmonic music in the 14th/15th century as musical culture transitioned form sacred music (meant for the church) to secular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/western-music-timeline/|title=Western Music Timeline {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Asian and Mid-Eastern music were similar to each other for their use of [[Microtonal music|microtone]]. East-Asian music shared some similarities with European Music for using a [[Pentatonic scale|pentatnotic scale]].

==The Americas==
{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}

The Postclassical Era of the Americas can be considered set at a different time span from that of Afro-Eurasia. As the developments of Mesoamerican and Andean civilization differ greatly from that of the Old World, as well as the speed at which it developed, the Postclassical Era in the traditional sense does not take place until near the end of the Medieval Age in Afro-Eurasia. As such, for the purposes of this article, the [[Classic stage]] of the Americas will be discussed here, which takes place from about 400 to 1400. For the technical Postclassical stage in American development, see [[Post-Classic stage]].

===North America===
As a continent there was little unified trade or communication. Advances in agriculture spread northward from Measoamerica indirectly through trade. Major cultural areas however still developed independently of each other.

==== Norse Contact and the Polar Regions ====
{{Main|Norse colonization of North America}}
[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|Authentic reconstruction of Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Photo provided by Dylan Kereluk.]]

While there was little regular contact between the Americas and the Old World the [[Vikings|Norse Vikings]] explored and even colonized [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]] as early as 1000. None of these settlements survived past [[Middle Ages|Medieval Times]]. Outside of Scandinavia knowledge of the discovery of the Americas was interpreted as a [[Vinland#Medieval geographers|remote island]] or the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|title=[Vinland in] Chapter 39|first=Adam of|last=Bremen|date=30 November 1977|website=www.canadianmysteries.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100208/http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|archivedate=17 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse arriving from Greenland settled Greenland from approximately 980 to 1450.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Norse arrived in southern [[Greenland]] prior to the 13th century approach of [[Inuit]] [[Thule people]] in the area. The extent of the interaction between the Norse and Thule is unclear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Greenland was valuable to the Norse due to trade of ivory that came from the tusks of walruses. The [[Little Ice Age]] adversely effected the colonies and they vanished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of archaeology|last=1956-|first=Cunliffe, Barry W.

The Norse also explored and colonized farther south in [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland Canada]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] referred to by the Norse as ''[[Vinland]]''. The colony at most existed for twenty years and resulted in no known transmission of diereses or technology to the [[First Nations]]. To the Norse ''Vinland'' was known for plentiful grape vines to make superior wine. One reason for the colony's failure was constant violence with the native [[Beothuk]] tribe who the Norse referred to as [[Skræling|Skraeling]].

After initial expeditions there is a possibility that the Norse continued to visit modern day Canada. Surviving records from Medieval Iceland indicate some sporadic voyages to a land called ''[[Markland]]''  possibly the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada]] as late as the 1347 presumably to collect wood for deforested Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seaver |first=Kristen A. |title=The Frozen Echo: Greenland and the Exploration of North America, Ca.

[[Native American in the United States|Native American tribes]] varied greatly in characteristics; some, including the [[Mississippian culture]] and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] were complex chiefdoms. Other nations which inhabited the states of the modern northern United States and Canada had less complexity and did not follow technological changes as quickly.

During the 12th century was the widespread adoption of Corn as a staple crop in the [[Eastern United States]]. Corn would continue to be the staple crop of natives in the Eastern United States and Canada until the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].
[[File:Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado USA.JPG|thumb|Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado|133x133px]]

[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Toltec [[Atlantean figures]] at the Tula site. The [[Toltec|Toltec Civilization]] inspired the later [[Aztecs]]. Photograph provided by the Wikipedia User Luidger|alt=|left]]At the beginning of the global Post Classic Period, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was at its zenith, housing over 125,000 people, at 450 A.D it was the sixth largest city in the world at the time. The city's residents built the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] the third largest pyramid of the world, oriented to follow astronomical events. Suddenly in the 6th and 7th centuries, the city suddenly declined possibly as a result of severe environmental damage caused by [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]. There is evidence that large parts of the city were burned, possibly in a domestic rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Teotihuacan/|title=Teotihuacan|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's legacy would inspire all future civilizations in the region.

Following Teotihuacan came the Classic Age of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Civilization]] clustered in dozens of city states on the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and modern day [[Guatemala]]. The most significant of these cities were [[Chichen Itza]] which often fiercely competed with its neighbors to be the dominant economic influence in the region. The Mayans had an upper caste of priests, who were well versed in astronomy, mathematics and writing. The Mayan developed the concept of zero, and a 365-day calendar which possibly per-dates its creation in Old-World societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab58|title=HISTORY OF MESOAMERICAN CIVILIZATION|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 900, many Mayan cities suddenly declined in a period of drought.[[File:Aztec11 Bloodletting.jpg|thumb|Aztec Bloodletting, priests conduct a heart sacrifice, from the ''Tudela Codex'', 16th century.|197x197px]]

The [[Toltec Empire]] arose the from the [[Toltec]] culture, and were remembered as wise and benevolent leaders. One priest-king called [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]] advocated against human sacrifice. After his death in 947, civil wars of religious character broke out between those who supported and opposed Topiltzin's teachings. Modern historians however are skeptical of the extent of Toltec and influence and believe that much of the information known about the Toltecs was created by the later Aztecs as an inspiration myth.

In the 1300s, a small band of violent, religious radicals called the [[Aztec]]s began minor raids throughout the area.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=148|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they began to claim connections with the Toltec civilization, and insisted they were the rightful successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://glencoe.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0024122010/899891/Bentley5e_Chapter_20_Intro_Final.pdf|title=Traditions and Encounters, AP Edition , 5th Edition|last=Bentley|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began to grow in numbers and conquer large areas of land.

In 1430 the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] allied with other powerful [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] speaking cities- [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] to create the Aztec Empire otherwise known as Triple-Alliance. Though referred to as an empire the Aztec Empire functioned as a system of tribute collection with Tenochtitlan at its center.  By the turn of the 16h century "[[flower war]]s" between the Aztecs and rival states such as [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] had continued for over fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}

South American civilization was concentrated in the Andean region which had already hosted complex cultures since 2,500&amp;nbsp;BC.  East of the Andean region, the natives were generally semi nomadic. Discoveries on the [[Amazon basin|Amazon River Basin]] indicate the region likely had a pre-contact population of five million people and hosted complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the continent numerous agricultural peoples from [[History of Colombia|Colombia]] to [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] steadily advanced until European contact.

During [[Ancient history|Ancient times]] the Andean Region had developed civilizations independent of outside influences including that of [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite  6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Post Classical era a cycle of civilizations continued until Spanish Contact. Collectively Andean societies lacked currency, a written language and solid draft animals enjoyed by old world civilizations. Instead Andeans developed other methods to foster their growth, including use of the [[quipu]] system to communicate messages, lamas to carry smaller loads and an economy based on [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Societies were often based on strict social hierarchies and economic redistribution from the ruling class.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the first half of the Post Classical Period the Andean Region was dominated by two almost equally powerful states. In the North of Peru was the [[Wari Empire]] and in the South of Peru and Bolivia was there is the [[Tiwanaku empire]] both of whom were inspired by the earlier [[Moche culture|Moche People]]. While the extent of their relationship to each other known, it is believed that they were in a Cold-War with one another, competing but avoiding direct conflict to avoid [[mutual assured destruction]]. Without war there was prosperity and around the year 700 Tiwanaku city hosted a population of 1.4.&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 8th century both states declined due to changing environmental conditions, laying the ground work for the Incas to emerge as a distinct culture centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=387|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century the [[Inca Empire]] rose to annex all other nations in the area. Led by their, sun-god king, [[Sapa Inca]], they slowly conquered what is now [[Peru]], and built their society throughout the Andes cultural region. The Incas spoke the [[Quechua languages]] The Incas used the advances created by earlier Andean societies .Incas have been known to have used [[abacus]]es to calculate mathematics. The Inca Empire is known for some of its magnificent structures, such as [[Machu Picchu]] in the [[Cusco region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=389|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The empire expanded quickly northwards to Ecuador, Southwards to central Chile.

As the postclassical era drew to a close in the 15th century, many of the empires established throughout the period were in decline. The [[Byzantine Empire]] would soon be overshadowed in the Mediterranean by Italian city states such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The Byzantines faced repeated attacks from eastern and western powers during the [[Fourth Crusade]], and declined further until the loss of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=138–139|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest change came in terms of trade and technology. The global significance of the fall of the Byzantines was the disruption of overland routes between Asia and Europe. Traditional dominance of [[Nomad]]ism in Eurasia declined and the [[Pax Mongolica|Pax Mongolia]] which had allowed for interactions between different civilizations was no longer available. China, which had previously engaged in expansion and innovation became isolationist in the 14th century under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and would remain so until the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|pages=168–169|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Asia]] and [[South Asia]] were conquered by [[Gunpowder Empires]] which successfully utilized advances in military technology but closed the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Madeline C.|last=Zilfi|year=1997|title=Halil Inalcik and Donald Quataert, editors.

Europeans – specifically the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and various Italian explorers – intended to replace land travel with sea travel.

Due to navigation advances Portugal would create a [[Portuguese Empire|global colonial empire]] beginning with the conquest of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in modern-day [[Malaysia]] from 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Harper Collins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=158|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Explorers such as the Spanish sponsored Italian [[Christopher Columbus]] intended to engage in trade by traveling on unfamiliar routes west from Europe. The subsequent [[European discovery of the Americas]] in 1492 resulted in the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian exchange]] and the world's first [[globalization]]. Spanish Explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] performed the first known [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|circumnavigation]] of Earth in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of goods and diseases across [[ocean]]s was unprecedented in creating a more connected world.

'''Project Gaia''' is a U.S. [[non-governmental]], [[non-profit]] organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in Ethiopia and other countries in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="ceihd"&gt;[http://ceihd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=50&amp;ItemId=1 "Impact of Improved Stoves and Fuels on IAP"], CEIHD Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages, environmental damage, and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world. Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and [[Madagascar]], and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.

== Current cooking methods in energy poor communities: the problem ==

=== Biomass fuels and associated risks ===
[[File:Indoor Woodfire Stove.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A traditional Nigerian wood-fired stove|A small boy sits by his mother's traditional wood fuel stove. Because of the inefficient heat production of wood-fired stoves such as this one, women cook indoors for hours each day in poorly ventilated dwellings.]]

More than 3 billion people cook with wood fire worldwide. Approximately 60% of African families cook with traditional biomass, a percentage that increases to 90% for Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Smoke and gaseous emissions pour out of burning wood, animal dung, or crop residues, leading to lung disease and respiratory illnesses in women and children. Traditional biomass fuels release emissions that contain pollutants dangerous to health, such as small particles, [[carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[butadiene]], [[formaldehyde]], and carcinogens such as [[benzopyrene]] and [[benzene]]. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that more than 4 million people die each year from household air pollution generated by cooking with solid fuels in poorly ventilated spaces. 500,000 of these deaths are from childhood pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancet.com/themed/global-burden-of-disease|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution is especially deadly for children; it is responsible for nearly 50% of pneumonia deaths in children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indoor air pollution ====
Because of their constant exposure to cook fires, women and children are particularly at risk. [[Indoor air pollution in developing nations|Indoor air pollution]] causes 56% of deaths and 80% of the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] for children under the age of five.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Indoor air pollution also increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and is associated with tuberculosis, [[perinatal mortality]], low birth weight, asthma, [[otitis media]], cancer of the upper airway, and [[cataract]]s. Respiratory disease in children is the leading cause of death for children, though [[malaria]] and diarrheal diseases are better known.&lt;ref name="changemakers"&gt;[http://proxied.changemakers.net/journal/300603/displayhealth.cfm-ID=208 "Removing Smoke from the Kitchen: An Alcohol Fueled Global Clean Cooking Initiative"], Changemakers.net, an initiative of Ashoka. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution also disproportionately effects refugee, poor urban, and HIV/AIDs populations living in crowded and poorly ventilated conditions, and already carrying the burden of disease.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Fuel collection ====
[[File:Woman Carrying Bundle of Wood, Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|alt=Ethiopian woman carrying large bundle of firewood outside of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|In Entoto, on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, thousands of women and girls collect firewood. They carry heavy loads for many miles which they will use or sell as woodfuel. In Ethiopia 90% of energy comes from biomass like wood and charcoal.]]

===== Personal safety =====
Meanwhile, collecting wood involves risk to personal safety. Women and older children usually collect wood, often facing gender-based harassment and disputes with landowners who accuse them of trespassing. Women in Ethiopia's [[UNHCR]] refugee camps say that they fear assault, rape, and violence while searching for wood.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Refugee Commission. [http://womensrefugeecommission.org/search?q=working+women+at+risk "Working Women At Risk: The Links Between Making a Living and Sexual Violence for Refugees in Ethiopia."]. 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Deforestation and desertification =====
Beyond these public health issues, cooking with wood fires is also unsustainable and contributes to rapid deforestation in the developing world.  Where wood is already limited, its collection leads to desertification. In Africa, collection of wood for cooking and charcoal production is the primary reason for the disappearance of the forests.&lt;ref name="poet"&gt;Flannery-Allen, Julie. [http://www.poet.com/vital/2010/2/stoves-that-save.asp "Vital, Ethanol brings an energy revolution to households in the developing world"]. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the burning of hydrocarbon fuels, coal, charcoal, and even dung contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Smoky cooking fires and stoves contribute to the soot that is estimated to cause approximately 16% of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD). [http://www.hedon.info/docs/COP14_IGSD_INECE_BlackCarbonBriefingNote.pdf "Reducing Black Carbon May Be the Fastest Strategy for Slowing Climate Change. IGSD/INECE Climate Briefing Note"]. Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon|Black carbon particles]] in the atmosphere are considered one of the most dangerous pollutants after carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Furthermore, higher rates of deforestation and desertification force women to travel further and further to gather fuelwood, increasing their vulnerability to the dangers of fuelwood collection.

=== Alternatives to biomass fuels ===
The available alternatives to biomass fuels do not offer much improvement. [[Kerosene]] is imported at significant expense, and is burnt with a wick stove that does not combust the fuel efficiently and tips or spills easily. The projected retail cost of ethanol is lower than that of government-subsidized kerosene in Ethiopia today.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene stoves are also prone to flare ups and explosions; accidental kerosene fires cause many injuries and deaths each year.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene releases carcinogenic emissions and is often poorly refined or [[Adulterant|adulterated]] by the time it is acquired for domestic use.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; [[Liquified petroleum gas|Liquified petroleum gas (LPG)]] burns cleanly but is expensive and cannot be produced locally. Charcoal, a processed biomass fuel, burns with less smoke, but emits carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Meanwhile, coal produces all of the dangerous emissions of traditional biomass fuels and depending on its quality, also produces [[sulfur oxides]] and toxic elements such as [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[fluorine]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Niger Delta Gas-Flares.jpg|thumb|alt=Gas flares in the Niger delta.|The Niger delta flares an estimated 17 billion cubic meters of gases—enough fuel to provide the combined annual natural gas consumption of Germany and France (World Bank). The numerous oil spills and the gas flaring (100 sites burning consecutively for 40 years) in much of the delta have taken a toll on the environment. [[Pollution]] has affected the air, water, soils, vegetation and even physical structures (UNDP, Nigeria 2006). If this natural gas were converted to methanol (a simple alcohol), there would be enough alcohol produced to provide cooking fuel for every home in Africa.]]

=== Aid and energy ===
Aid initiatives and emergency response projects rarely provide energy for cooking, focusing instead on food rations and necessary cookware.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Occasionally the UNHCR purchases and provides biomass and transports it to communities where it is desperately needed.  When aid projects do involve stoves, many undertake the dissemination of improved biomass stoves. These burn biomass fuel more efficiently but do not eliminate the household need for biomass nor eliminate indoor air pollution.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== The solution: alcohol fuels and clean cookstoves ==
[[File:USI bioethanol plant.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the USI bioethanol plant in Brazil|In a continuous process, this USI bioethanol plant produces 95°GL ethanol from starch and sucrose at a rate of 10 liters per hour.]]

=== Alcohol fuels ===

Alcohol fuels have a [[Flammability limit|low-flammability limit (LFL)]] that is higher than [[Fossil fuel|hydrocarbon fuels]], which means they do not catch fire easily, even when spilled. They are extinguishable by water and are not prone to explosion like LPG (propane and butane). Alcohol burns cleanly, producing only [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor, and none of the [[soot]] or toxic chemicals produced by solid fuels and kerosene.
Alcohol fuels are clean (with particle emissions far below the WHO levels).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/exposure/en/index.html "Pollution and Exposure Levels." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; When paired with an efficient stove, alcohol fuels can drastically improve indoor air quality, and thus improve respiratory health and quality of life by reducing the global burden of disease."  &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/burden_global/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is beginning to gain wider recognition as a source of fuel.  Because of initiatives like Project Gaia, the UNDP has placed the previously absent ethanol and methanol near the top of its “energy ladder,” a progression of fuels that range from dirty and inefficient (e.g. biomass) to clean and efficient (e.g. biogas, LPG, ethanol, methanol).&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Project Gaia believes in gradual introduction of ethanol-burning appliances into both the private household market and the small or large institutional market, to ensure widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As the alcohol fuel market increases, and acceptance of clean cookstoves grows, Project Gaia sees the potential for the use of other high-performing alcohol appliances that provide lighting, refrigeration and air-tempering, and generation.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Ethanol ====
[[Ethanol]] can be produced locally from byproducts that would otherwise cause environmental damage. It can be produced from [[biomass]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], and even [[landfill gas]]—resources plentiful in many developing countries.  The [[Renewable energy in Africa|use of alcohol fuel for household fuel]], therefore, is efficient resource management—transforming waste products to a highly valuable resource.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  This transformation can lead to a cleaner environment, the forming of new jobs in industry, agriculture, manufacturing, and the service sector, and a decreased need for imported fuels.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;

=== Clean cookstoves ===

==== The CleanCook Stove ====
[[File:Clean Cook with Ethiopian Cookware.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two-burner CleanCook stove with round-based Ethiopian pots.|The two-burner CleanCook is pictured with traditional, round-based, Ethiopian pots. The stove has been tested and modified to meet the needs of the local culture.]]
[[File:CleanCook One-Burner with flame.jpg|thumb|left|alt=CleanCook One-Burner Stove with Flame|The CleanCook one-burner stove. The canister is the same as the two-burner stove, holding 1.2 liters and cooking for 4.5 hours—enough for one day of cooking for a typical family.]]

===== Origins =====
Project Gaia's team currently works with the alcohol-based CleanCook stove, a stable, stainless steel, one or two-burner stove adapted from the Origo stove invented by Bengt Ebbeson in 1979 and manufactured by Swedish company Dometic AB, the leading manufacturer of alcohol stoves and appliances worldwide. The Origo stove, recognized as the best alcohol stove available, is popular in the leisure markets in the U.S. and Europe, commonly for boating and camping use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"&gt;[http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/gaia08 “Clean, safe ethanol stoves for refugee homes”], The Ashden Awards for sustainable energy. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The stove's working life is to projected to be 5–10 years for daily use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia works to adapt the stove to local cooking needs and habits. Some of the adaptations made to the CleanCook include the slight raising and redesign of the pot-stand to allow for larger pots and for more oxygen to reach the flame, and the addition of handles to make transport and refill of the stove easier.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Dometic =====
Dometic seeks to address the developing world market because alcohol fuel technologies are particularly appropriate for it.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  The CleanCook contains a non-pressurized, no-spill fuel tank that can hold [[methanol]] or [[ethanol]]. The CleanCook stove was designed with several specific safety measures.  The CleanCook stove's fuel canister holds an absorbent mineral fiber covered by a protective metal mesh, preventing fuel from spilling from the canister even when the stove is inverted.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The design of this fuel tank eliminates risk of explosion, flare-up, or leakage, and other safety features built into the stove make the CleanCook less likely to cause burns than other cooking methods.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  Meanwhile, the CleanCook is a high-performing stove, equivalent in power (1.5 to 2[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) and temperature to an LPG stove.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Spill Proof Fuel Canisters.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Demonstration of the spill-proof canisters of the CleanCook stove|At the Dom Orione pilot study in rural Brazil, Harry Stokes of the Stokes Consulting Group demonstrates the CleanCook's spill-proof canister to Sanyogita Seksaria of the Shell Foundation as Regina Couto, Director of Projeto Gaia Brasil, looks on.]]

===== Operation of the Stove =====
To operate the stove, its fuel canister must be filled with one liter of ethanol. If pouring the fuel results in drops around the hole, these must be wiped away. The canister must be clipped onto the base of the stove, the regulator opened, and the ethanol vapor lit with a match or lighter.  After cooking, the canister should be left in position to limit further evaporation of remaining ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Emissions vs. performance =====
The US-based [[Aprovecho|Aprovecho Research Center]] has conducted tests comparing the emissions and energy performance of the CleanCook in comparison with conventional LPG and kerosene stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  When compared with kerosene, the CleanCook used less energy, produced lower emissions, and was quicker than to bring water to a boil.  Compared with LPG, the CleanCook produced the same level of particulate emissions, but LPG released lower emissions of CO and was quicker to boil water.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  The [[UNDP]] in Malawi compared the CleanCook with wood and charcoal stoves and found that the CleanCook cut wood stoves’ CO emission in half, particulate emission by 99%, and energy use by 71%. The findings in comparison with charcoal showed similar results, with the energy use decreased by 55% and the emission and particulate reduction even greater than for wood stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

== Local production and sustainability ==
Project Gaia believes that [[sustainable business]] is the best way to accomplish the goal of providing clean and safe cooking technology, and is supported by the [http://www.undp.org/partners/business/gsb/whatcangsbdo.shtml UNDP Growing Sustainable Business (GSB)] in its initiatives to bring the private and public sectors together.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia's business model involves the merging of stove manufacture and sale with fuel production and sale, thereby giving consumers confidence that they will receive fuel after purchasing stoves, and also allowing part of the stoves’ costs to transfer to the fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  This financing mechanism is the model used for mobile phones and airtime – the initial cost of the stove would be cheaper to ensure its affordability, and this discount would be recovered over the course of several years in a very small mark-up in fuel cost.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Another benefit of this system is that it allows for ownership of the right to produce the stove or parts of the stove in Ethiopia.  The CleanCook is currently manufactured in Slovakia, but the possibility of local production in Ethiopia is currently being explored.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Local production is in its early stages in Addis Ababa, with a starting goal of 18,000 stoves to be produced yearly.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia's business goals also include  certification through the [[CDM Gold Standard]] for dissemination of CleanCook stoves and promotion of alcohol fuels.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== Impact through education ==
[[File:Bonga Refugee Camp Survey Taking.jpg|thumb|alt=Ethiopian Chemical Engineer Firehiwot Mengesha, of Gaia Association speaks with [[Sudanese refugees]] in the Bonga refugee camp as part PGI's education program.|Ethiopian Chemical Engineer Firehiwot Mengesha, of Gaia Association speaks with [[Sudanese refugees]] in the Bonga refugee camp as part PGI's education program.]]
Education about indoor air pollution is a fundamental element of Project Gaia's mission, which it has pursued by spreading awareness about the impact of IAP through workshops, seminars, media coverage, and engagement with local, state, and federal government, and organizations such as the [[WHO]] in Ethiopia, and the [[FDRE]]’s Ministry of Health.  The danger of IAP and its effects on populations is often neglected, with malaria, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases receiving the majority of attention.

Project Gaia is also working to educate the public about alcohol fuels and their potential for use in the developing world, and specifically, in the context of household energy.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The market for families throughout the developing world that could benefit from the use of alcohol fuels for cooking and household energy is in the range of 600 million.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; As stated by the UNDP World Energy Assessment (2000), supplying modern energy services to the two billion people who still cook with traditional solid fuels and lack access to electricity is one of the most pressing problems facing humanity today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html "World Energy Assessment: Energy and the Challenge of Sustainability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609101755/http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html |date=2007-06-09 }}, UNDP.

==== The Gaia Association ====
The Ethiopian counterpart of Project Gaia, Inc. is the Ethiopian non-governmental organization, the Gaia Association, which is a UNHCR implementing partner. Ethiopia possesses all of the necessary factors for successful technology transfer of alcohol fuel: the quantity of ethanol produced by its sugar industry, the fact that it depends on imported petroleum fuels and biomass, and its need for improved fuels and safer stoves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedon.info/ProjectGaiaEthiopia “Project Gaia Ethiopia”], HEDON Household Energy Network. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ethiopia was producing approximately 8 million liters of ethanol annually.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Molasses and other byproducts of the industry were being dumped in Ethiopia's rivers until about a decade ago when one of Ethiopia's five mills, Finchaa Sugar Company, solved the waste problem by acquiring a distillery and producing ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; Gaia answered an early query that Finchaa Sugar opened, proposing a household energy market for the ethanol, as no gasoline blending or export market was being successfully developed.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Ethiopia's other mills have also become interested in producing ethanol, as a way to balance the fluctuations of sugar pricing.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's government is developing plans to build ethanol-producing distilleries at all sugar mills, creating an ethanol supply that could fuel over 200,000 stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

Gaia is now planning to build its own micro distillery in Ethiopia as a demonstration project for what can be achieved with small and micro scale distillation plants. Gaia is working with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection authority, the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture to build this distillery.  A range of feedstocks are being considered, including more conventional feedstocks such as molasses, and sugar cane or sweet sorghum juice, or unconventional feedstocks such as fruit waste from the markets in Addis Ababa or sugary materials from plants growing wild such as cactus, the bean pods from the mesquite tree (Prosopis), a noxious invasive species in Ethiopia,  or the Giant Milkweed plant (Calotropis procera).  Gaia is hoping to encourage  very small scale distilleries owned by farmer groups or co-ops and small to medium-sized local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.esmap.org/beia/BEIA_call_for_proposals_pilot_projects_English.pdf “African Renewable Energy Access Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa”], Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fuel blending ====
The domestic fuel blending market and the export market for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic companies such as National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the fuel supply system is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes [[adulterated]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote [[phase separation]] and worsened contamination.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As for the export market, Ethiopia's ethanol production is too small to attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's landlocked location also makes export difficult.  The local selling of Finchaa's ethanol, therefore, provides a sustainable opportunity for Ethiopia, with prices that are affordable but also competitive with the potential export market.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Awbarre Deforestation.jpg|thumb|left|View from the road, between Jijiga and the Awbarre camp; the land is desolate as a result of the heavy deforestation, making it difficult to grow crops or collect firewood. Refugees often must resort to digging up roots for fuel.]]

==== Deforestation ====
Ethiopia is energy-poor and 95-98% deforested, although most of its population still depends on biomass fuels.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Before beginning its pilot studies, Gaia found that refugee families use approximately 3.7 tons of fuel wood a year, and spend up to eight hours every two or three days collecting this wood.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

==== Pilot testing and stove placement ====
CleanCook stoves have now been tested in and placed in three UNHCR refugee camps, HIV/AIDS orphanages run by [[Mother Teresa#Missionaries of Charity|Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity]], in a rural village in [[Somali Region|Ethiopia's Somali State]], and in lower and middle-income private homes in Addis Ababa. Pilot studies conducted by the Gaia Association have yielded positive results and acceptance and widespread approval among households both in the refugee camps and in Addis Ababa. Project Gaia is also working to bring stove manufacturing to Addis Ababa by linking the Ethiopian business Makobu Enterprises PLC and Dometic AB, and encouraging government support for the designation of ethanol for household fuel purposes.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Refugee camps in Ethiopia ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Denan Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ethiopian Somali Refugee camp on the outskirts of Denan|Ethiopian Somalis living on the outskirts of Denan, deep in the Somali regional state, are semi-nomadic herders. Having been left without animals due to drought or flood, they have come to this makeshift camp. At the time this picture was taken, they had not eaten in many days and were in desperate need for both food and water.]] --&gt;

===== Environmental impact =====
Refugee camps in Eastern Ethiopia that house refugees of Somali conflict have placed heavy pressure on the environment and resources of Ethiopia for the past two decades, reaching a combined population of 600,000 refugees in the early 1990s. The UNHCR and its partner NGOs supply these camps with basic needs but have not provided cooking fuel until recently. Fuel wood gathering, the responsibility of refugee women, has resulted in the almost complete deforestation of the regions around the refugee camps, and Ethiopia's government has banned all cutting of live trees around the camps.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The UNHCR must provide alternatives to wood fuel at any new refugee camps.

===== Active projects =====
Project Gaia is currently active in Awbarre refugee camp (formerly known as Teferi Ber) and [[Kebri Beyah|Kebribeyah]] refugee camp, where all of the camp's approximately 1780 families have CleanCook stoves and a daily ration of ethanol, funded cooperatively by the UNHCR and the Gaia Association. The combined population of Kebribeyah and Awbarre camps is approximately 27,000 people, and the UNHCR is planning to re-open at least two more camps to make room for past refugees who have fled to Ethiopia again after returning to Somalia and experiencing worsening conditions since July 2007.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

In 2012, Gaia Association received a grant from the Nordic Climate Fund (NCF) to demonstrate the feasibility of locally produced ethanol for cooking. The grant provided funds to build a community owned and operated ethanol microdistillery. The distillery, which is currently under construction in the Kolfe-Keranio community on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, will be run by a local women's cooperative, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association.

Also in 2012, in an effort to address the environmental and social problems associated with the overreliance on traditional biomass for household cooking, Gaia Association, together with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority, is piloting a project to demonstrate small-scale, community owned and driven ethanol production from sugarcane (in the form of ethanol microdistilleries) in Amhara, Oromya &amp; Gambella regional states. Partial installation of the EMDs has been completed in two of the three regional states.

==== Partnerships ====
Project Gaia works in collaboration with many organizations that help support pilot studies, encourage government involvement, and provide local or regional support. Gaia's lead business partners are members of the [[United Nations Global Compact]], and many members of the Gaia team have joined the Partners for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaonline.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; which developed out of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in Johannesburg with the goal of cleaning up indoor air.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia is also a member of the HEDON Household Energy Network which unites key actors and stakeholders in the movement for a cleaner, more efficient, and affordable household energy sector.

In Ethiopia, Gaia has created partnerships with organizations that serve poor communities and refugee camps.  Gaia's Ethiopia partners include the UNHCR-RLO and the UNDP, the Good Shepherd Sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers’ Association, Finchaa Sugar Company, the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, and the Ogaden Welfare and Development Association. Under its Breathe Easy Program, the Shell Foundation is a technical and a funding partner for Gaia's Ethiopia and Brazil projects. These partners have supported Gaia's pilot studies and helped to strengthen the relationships between Ethiopian businesses and European and American businesses, with the goal of facilitating the sustainable transfer of technology, goods, and services to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
[[File:Lucy with stove in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove|A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove]]

By 2050 Nigeria is expected to outgrow the population of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/10-projections-for-the-global-population-in-2050/|title=10 projections for the global population in 2050|date=3 February 2014|work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cookstoves- and more importantly, cooking fuels- is huge. Spurring both ethanol and methanol production will create local jobs, help give farmers new markets, and be locally sourced.

Nigeria, like Ethiopia has high potential for large-scale ethanol production from starchy cassava and sugarcane molasses.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Nigeria also possesses an excess of natural gas in the form of gas flares; it is responsible for 40% of worldwide flaring. This natural gas can be easily converted to methanol and Nigeria's flared gas alone could fuel CleanCook stoves in every household in West Africa. Nigeria, like other West African countries, is energy poor and depends on fuelwood for cooking.  In Nigeria, Project Gaia depends on the local support of the Centre of Household Energy and Health, based in the Niger Delta. Gaia's main sponsor in Delta State is the U.S. EPA in partnership with the Delta State Government.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Gaia's technical partner for Nigeria, HydroChem, which is part of the Linde Group, is the leading provider of small-scale hydrogen, CO, and CO2 plants. These plants are easily adapted to manufacture methanol, by converting natural gas into liquid form, and thereby creating a fuel that can be used in the household energy market.  In gas or electric form, it is not feasible for the developing world market because of the investment, infrastructure, and maintenance necessary and subsidies that are required to make it affordable.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  HydroChem's plants are ideal for local, small-scale production at low expense in countries like Nigeria, where gas flares could be converted into household fuel.

During the pilot study, 28 families tested the CleanCook stove.]]

Currently, Project Gaia is working with local commercial partners to begin a 10,000 stove pilot study.

=== Brazil ===
Project Gaia studied the acceptance of the CleanCook ethanol stove in different urban and rural households in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil between 2006-2007. Because LPG was too costly for low-income families, most households in the study had been using firewood for cooking. In some areas, woodfuel collection is banned. Participating families could get fuel for cooking easily and cheaply at the gas pump. Households found ethanol easy, safe and affordable to use. The ability to buy ethanol in small quantities, rather than being forced to purchase large canisters of LPG, was most beneficial to low-income households.

Brazil's strong social policies have helped to lift families out of poverty and increase access to energy. As Brazil develops, Project Gaia is working to replicate the Brazilian model in other project sites. Project Gaia's work continues in partnership with [http://www.prolenha.org.br/ Prolenha].

=== Madagascar ===
[[File:Stove Testing Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|n Antananarivo, Madagascar, a cook lights a traditional three stove fire. Here she is boiling meat as one of the steps of the Controlled Cooking Test. Wood fired stoves like the one pictured are common here in Madagascar and contribute to the deforestation of Madagascar.]]
Project Gaia began work in Madagascar beginning in 2008 at the request of the Government of Madagascar. Project Gaia's work is commissioned with the objective of multifaceted contribution to the goals of the Africa Action Plan (AAP) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to the goals of several initiatives related to the development of alternative household energy sources. Gaia's work with household or indoor air pollution will address other MDGs such as the promotion of gender equality, improving maternal health, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) is one initiative that is working to promote alternative sources of energy that will decrease the burden on Madagascar's forests and to reduce child mortality, a large factor of which is the household use of solid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalactionconsulting.org/consulting/capabilities_energy?id=200806 “Assessment of Ethanol as a Household Fuel”], Practical Action Consulting. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Project Gaia's involvement also contributes to goals in several specific sectors including those of the Ministère de l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts et du Tourisme, the Ministère de l’Energie et des Mines, the Ministère de la Santé, du Planning Familial et de la Protection, the Ministère de l’Agriculture, Elevage et la Pêche, and the [http://www.tanymeva.org.mg/ Foundation Tany Meva] - piloting community-based use of ethanol for household cooking.

=== Haiti ===
Project Gaia launched operations in Haiti, in response to the increased need for relief after the [[Hurricane Tomas|2010 hurricane]] and in the hopes of contribution to the “Build Back Better” strategy being developed by Haiti's government and other engaged nations and organizations. That Haiti is more than 98% deforested makes transition away from wood fuels essential, especially since 70% of Haiti's population continues to rely on charcoal and firewood for fuel. Since the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]], Haitian families have been spending at least 40% of their income on charcoal and all fuel prices have surged.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/30042996/PGI-Haiti-Handout-3-10-10 “Project Gaia &amp; Haiti”], Project Gaia, Inc. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Haiti has great potential for local, sustainable production of ethanol because of its past status as a significant sugar cane producer and the capacity for revival of this industry. One million tons of sugar cane is produced annually – a decrease from 3 million in 1987 – and sugar mills and distilleries are already in place.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Ethanol, even before it is produced locally, can still be sold locally for a lower price than Haitian charcoal.

For this project, Gaia is receiving donations of ethanol fuel for CleanCook stoves from the Brazilian government and the Brazilian ethanol industry. Gaia's approach in Haiti involves three phases: 1) small-scale emergency intervention through donation of 500–5000 stoves, and work with local mills and distilleries to scale up domestic production of ethanol 2) larger-scale scale-up of 20,000–50,000 stoves and ethanol to IDP camps and large communities, partnership with other organizations and 3) sustainability work and local development, cooperation with government to encourage the passage of a [[biofuel]]s plan, assessment of the state of local mills and distilleries that are closed, and of the possibility for micro distillery.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt;

Gaia's collaborators for its Haiti Project include the Government of Haiti Ministry of Women's Affairs, Government of Brazil Ministry of External Relations, UNICA, COSAN, Dometic Group, Viva Rio Haiti, Marin Biological Lab (Woods Hole), CODEP, Terra Endeavors, Inc., J&amp;J Import, BDP International, Trees Water People, [[Public-Private Alliance Foundation]] (PPAF).

== Pilot studies and financial sustainability ==
[[File:Low Income Housing, Location of Pilot Stoves.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ethiopian woman involved in PGI's pilot testing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, standing outside of her low income housing complex|During the pilot study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Gaia Association placed two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. 150 of the stoves were tested in very low-income homes like that of Senedu, pictured above, a resident of a low-income condominium in Addis Ababa. One goal of the study was to find a price for ethanol that would be affordable for the average household, but also partially subsidize the fuel for use in poorer households.]]
Gaia Association conducted thorough pilot studies on the use of different household fuels in Addis Ababa, their varying prices, and the rates of their consumption.  In 2004, Gaia began testing two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. Before and after the 850 stoves were placed, Gaia's field staff conducted household energy audits, consumer satisfaction studies and fuel price elasticity studies. In 50 homes, Gaia monitored IAP, recording levels of CO and particulate matter.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Approximately 150 of the stoves that were tested in Addis Ababa were placed in very low-income homes. This part of the study helped Gaia determine the ideal price level for ethanol so that it would be affordable to the average household and also reach the poorer households.

=== Pilot studies and business model ===
Throughout the process of pilot studies in each of its project sites, Gaia's team documented progress and compiled reports that charted the study results.  Project Gaia used the study results to develop its business plan and to answer questions such as: Who is interested in the stove? Who can produce it? How should it be adapted to better suit its use? Who can distribute it? Who can supply the fuel? How will stove and fuel be linked?&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

=== Simulation of future market conditions and local purchasing power ===
To simulate reality and ensure affordability of the stove, Gaia charged for ethanol during the Pilot studies.  After a month of free fuel, during which families could get used to cooking with the stove, each household paid for its fuel, allowing fuel use and rationing to be accurately documented. After the first month of purchasing fuel, its price was increased to reflect the cost of ethanol once the local market is fully developed. Price Elasticity studies documented the impact of the price increase on the family and their capacity and willingness to pay. Pilot study data showed that these households demonstrated the necessary purchasing power to afford CleanCook stoves and their fuel, if the purchasing price of the stove was subsidized.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Even the poorest urban communities pay for cooking fuels because they cannot gather their fuel, as many refugees do in rural areas of Ethiopia. Wood and charcoal prices have risen because of the need to travel further and further outside of the city to gather them.  Poor families are often forced to pay more for fuel because they buy small quantities of low-quality fuel when they can afford to – sometimes before each meal. Even the lowest grade of fuel is often expensive when purchased this way.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:FWFCA financial security.jpg|thumb|alt=An Ethiopian woman, a member of FWFCA, working at a loom|The Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association (FWFCA) offers women an alternative to carrying fuelwood into Ethiopian cities. It was one of several instances in which, once relieved of firewood collection duties, women are able to work towards financial security. Instead of gathering firewood, women receive training on weaving and together produce scarves and other fabrics using looms. This offers women an alternative source of income.]]

=== Government subsidization of petroleum-based fuels and long-term financial impact ===
Domestically produced ethanol would not require as much subsidization as petroleum-based fuels like kerosene because it can be sold for a lower price. Its domestic production, meanwhile, benefits the economy, and the subsidy that is contributed for its purchase does not leave the country as it does for imported fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

In the context of the refugee camps, ethanol was not sold because of the lack of purchasing power among refugees. When fuel gathering exhausts the little remaining biomass, energy provisions will have to be donor-supplied. Providing stoves and improved fuel, however, can save long-term costs by increasing productivity and well-being among refugees, increasing industry, and reducing health care costs.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Response to the stoves was very positive, both in households where families had experience with modern stoves and improved fuels, and in households without previous experience.  The dominant response included appreciation for the cleanliness and safety of the stove and fuel and a positive evaluation of the stove's power and efficiency. In the refugee camps, CleanCook stoves allowed more women to cook inside their homes, and diminished the need for fuel wood gathering and allowed women more time to pursue income-generating activities, take care of personal health, provide childcare, and seek education. A reduced amount of fuel wood gathering also eased tensions between refugees and local landowners who do not welcome the gathering of wood from their land.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt;

Many groups supported Gaia in its pilot studies, including the UNHCR management and logistical staff for the refugee camps, by the Refugee Care Netherlands (ZOA) staff and FDRE Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA) staff, field survey staff from the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, an Ethiopian government agency under the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the UNDP Growing Sustainable Businesses Program, Winrock International's Clean Energy Group, Makobu Enterprises management personnel, Dometic AB representatives from Research &amp; Development, the Stove Division and Marketing, the Stokes Consulting Group, UNDP-GSB consultants, Finchaa Sugar, consultants from the Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development at the University of California at Berkeley, and Shell Foundation advisors.

The [[global surveillance disclosure]] released to media by [[Edward Snowden]] has caused tension in the [[bilateral relations]] of the [[United States]] with several of its allies and economic partners as well as in its relationship with the [[European Union]]. In August 2013, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] announced the creation of "a review group on intelligence and communications technologies" that would brief and later report to him.&lt;ref name="MacAskill"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen|title=White House insists James Clapper will not lead NSA surveillance review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/13/white-house-james-clapper-nsa-surveillance-review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using "[[backdoor (computing)|backdoors]]" in hardware or software.&lt;ref name=reviewpanel&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|title=Obama panel recommends new limits on N.S.A. spying|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/report-on-nsa-surveillance-tactics.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2013|author2=Savage, Charlie}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey R.

[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[general (United States)|General]] [[Keith B. Alexander]], then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, "These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security." He added that "the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks."&lt;ref name="nsaalexander1"/&gt;

In June 2014, Alexander's recently installed successor as the NSA's director, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Michael S. Rogers]], said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done overall did not lead him to conclude that "the sky is falling." Conceding there was no absolute protection against leaks by a dedicated insider with access to the agency's networks, Rogers said the NSA must nevertheless "ensure that the volume" of data taken by Snowden "can't be stolen again."&lt;ref name=SkyNotFalling&gt;Sanger, David E.

On June 21, 2013, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R. Clapper]] issued an apology for giving erroneous testimony under oath to the [[United States Congress]]. Earlier in March that year, Clapper was asked by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ron Wyden]] to clarify the alleged surveillance of U.S. citizens by the NSA:

In an interview shortly after Snowden's disclosures were first published, Clapper stated that he had misunderstood Wyden's question and answered in what he thought was the "least untruthful manner".&lt;ref name="ClapperNBCInterview"&gt;[http://www.nbcuni.com/corporate/newsroom/nbc-news-exclusive-transcript-of-andrea-mitchells-interview-with-director-of-national-intelligence-james-clapper/ NBC News Exclusive Transcript of Andrea Mitchell's Interview with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, June 9, 2013].

Clapper said: "My response was clearly erroneous—for which I apologize".&lt;ref name="dni"&gt;{{cite web|title=DNI Clapper Letter on Misunderstandings Arising from his March 12th Appearance Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|url=http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/2013-06-21%20DNI%20Ltr%20to%20Sen.%20Feinstein.pdf|publisher=[[Director of National Intelligence]]|accessdate=July 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I9BnJX1H|archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase transparency and because it is in the public interest the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of the following documents pertaining to the collection of telephone metadata pursuant to [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act]] on July 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Shawn|title=DNI Clapper Declassifies and Releases Telephone Metadata Collection Documents|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/908-dni-clapper-declassifies-and-releases-telephone-metadata-collection-documents|publisher=Director of Public Affairs Office of the Director of National Intelligence|accessdate=August 17, 2013|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were:

; Press censorship
In June 2013, British government officials issued a confidential [[DA-Notice]] to several press organizations, with the aim of restricting their ability to report on these leaks.&lt;ref name="danotice2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=MoD serves news outlets with D notice over surveillance leaks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/defence-d-bbc-media-censor-surveillance-security|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013|location=London|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the [[United States Army]] barred its personnel from access to parts of the website of ''[[The Guardian]]'' after that site's publication of Snowden's leaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montereyherald.com/local/ci_23554739/restricted-web-access-guardian-is-army-wide-officials "Restricted Web access to the Guardian is Armywide, say officials"], Philipp Molnar, ''Monterey Herald'', June 27, 2013.

According to a survey undertaken by the human rights group [[PEN International]], these disclosures have had a [[chilling effect]] on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have [[self-censorship|self-censored]] themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.&lt;ref name="penc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Matt Sledge|title=NSA 'Chilling' Effect Feared By Writers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/13/nsa-writers_n_4267716.html|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=November 14, 2013|date=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PEN American Center Report Shows Impact of NSA Surveillance on American Writers|url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2013/11/13/pen-american-center-report-shows-impact-nsa-surveillance-american-writers|publisher=[[PEN American Center]]|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miranda was returning from Berlin, carrying 58,000 [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] documents on a single computer file&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; to Greenwald in Brazil.

;Destruction of evidence

''The Guardian'' editor [[Alan Rusbridger]] said the newspaper had received legal threats from the British government and was urged to surrender all documents leaked by Snowden.

A senior analyst at the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] said it was "clear to every single tech company that this is affecting their bottom line," and predicted that the U.S. cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. [[Forrester Research]], an independent technology and market research company, said losses could be as high as $180 billion, or 25 percent of industry revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|title=Revelations of N.S.A.

=== Allegations of adverse consequences for US and UK security ===
U.S. Army General Keith Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, "These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security." He added that "the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks."&lt;ref name="nsaalexander1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roulo|first=Claudette|title=Leaks Damage National Security, NSA Director Says|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=120387|publisher=American Forces Press Service|accessdate=July 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/OS678|archivedate=December 16, 2013}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6I9BwalAH Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, former GCHQ director Sir [[David Omand]], speaking of how useful for [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russia's intelligence services]] Snowden's stay in Russia could be, told the BBC: "Part of me says that not even the [[KGB]] in its heyday of [[Kim Philby|Philby]], [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]] in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents."&lt;ref name="Omand"&gt;{{cite news |last= Corera|first=Gordon|title=Edward Snowden revelations: Can we trust the spying state? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213|date=October 4, 2013 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden stated that he had not leaked any documents to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/edward-snowden-russia_n_3573844.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Michael | last=Calderone | title=Snowden Refutes Anonymous Media Claims About Him | date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in October, [[Andrew Parker (MI5 officer)|Andrew Parker]], director general of the UK [[MI5|Security Service]], maintained that the exposing of intelligence techniques had given extremists the ability to evade the intelligence agencies; he said, "It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques.

In August 2013, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities even before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations.&lt;ref name=CNN081313&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Z.

On October 31, 2013, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] stated that "in some cases" the NSA had "reached too far" in some of its surveillance activities, and promised that it would be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/230197991.html Kerry: Some NSA surveillance work reached 'too far' and will be stopped].

In January 2014, James Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]]. He asked that "Snowden and his accomplices" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word "accomplices" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, "Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs."&lt;ref&gt;

Also in January 2014, a review by the [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] (PCLOB) concluded that the NSA's collection of every U.S. phone record on a daily basis violates the legal restrictions of the statute cited to authorize it. "The Section 215 bulk telephone records program," PCLOB reported, "lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215 [of the [[Patriot Act]]], implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value. As a result, the Board recommends that the government end the program."&lt;ref name=PCLOB215&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted under Section 215 |url=http://www.pclob.gov/All%20Documents/Report%20on%20the%20Telephone%20Records%20Program/PCLOB-Report-on-the-Telephone-Records-Program.pdf |agency=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House rejected the findings, saying "We simply disagree with the board's analysis on the legality of the program."&lt;ref name=FoxPCLOB&gt;{{cite news|title=White House rejects review board finding that NSA data sweep is illegal|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/23/independent-federal-review-board-says-nsa-phone-data-collection-program-should/|work=Fox/AP|accessdate=January 29, 2014|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second PCLOB review, in July 2014, concluded that the NSA's surveillance program targeting foreigners overseas is lawful, under Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], and effective but that certain elements push "close to the line" of being unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=WaPo702&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Independent panel: NSA surveillance program targeting foreigners is lawful|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/independent-panel-nsa-surveillance-program-targeting-foreigners-is-lawful/2014/07/01/2b749fa2-018c-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html|work=The Washington Post| date=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The July report said that the Board was "impressed with the rigor of the government’s efforts to ensure that it acquires only those communications it is authorized to collect, and that it targets only those persons it is authorized to target.

Another proposal is the [[FISA Improvements Act]] that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records.

=== Judiciary ===
In April 2014, ''The Washington Post'' reported that some federal judges holding low-level positions had been balking at sweeping requests by law enforcement for cellphone and other sensitive personal data. The ''Post'' called it "a small but growing faction, including judges in Texas, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania," and said the judges deemed the requests overly broad and at odds with basic constitutional rights. Although some rulings were overturned, said the ''Post,'' their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans. Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at [[Perkins Coie]] who represents technology and telecommunications companies, told the ''Post'' that these judges "don't want to be the ones who approve an order that later becomes public and embarrassing…. Nobody likes to be characterized as a rubber stamp." According to the ''Post,'' some legal observers have called this "the Magistrates' Revolt," which began several years ago; however, it gained power amid mounting public anger about government surveillance capabilities after the NSA disclosures.&lt;ref name=WaPoJudgesBalk&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-level federal judges balking at law enforcement requests for electronic evidence|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/low-level-federal-judges-balking-at-law-enforcement-requests-for-electronic-evidence/2014/04/24/eec81748-c01b-11e3-b195-dd0c1174052c_story.html|work=WashingtonPost|accessdate=25 April 2014|first1=Ann E.|last1=Marimow|first2=Craig|last2=Timberg|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lawsuits====
In the wake of the NSA leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and [[Judicial Watch]] founder [[Larry Klayman]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him (see ''[[Klayman v. Obama]]''), and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional (see ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]''). Once the judge in each case had issued rulings seemingly at odds with one another, Gary Schmitt (former staff director of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]) wrote in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', "The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff."&lt;ref&gt;

After the June 2013 release, a [[political movement]] known as "''[[Restore the Fourth]]''" was formed in the United States and rapidly gained momentum. In early July, ''Restore the Fourth'' was responsible for protests in more than 80 cities including Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. These protests were loosely coordinated via online messaging services and involved protestors from all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Kelly|title=Protests against the NSA spring up across U.S.|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/04/tech/web/restore-nsa-protests|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 13, 2013|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2013, an anti-NSA rally called "[[Stop Watching Us]]" was held in Washington, D.C., billed by organizers as the "largest rally yet to protest mass surveillance".

An analysis released by the [[New America Foundation]] in January 2014 reviewed 225 terrorism cases since the [[September 11 attacks]] found that the NSA's bulk collection of phone records "has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism," and that U.S. government claims of the program's usefulness were "overblown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | title=National Security | date=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/13/262098004/review-of-terrorism-cases-finds-nsa-spying-helped-very-little|title=Review Of Terrorism Cases Finds NSA Spying Helped Very Little|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

==== China ====
On June 17, 2013, nearly two weeks after the first disclosure was published, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Ministry]] spokeswoman [[Hua Chunying]] said at a daily briefing, "We believe the United States should pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China asks U.S. to explain Internet surveillance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/17/us-usa-security-china-idUSBRE95G06R20130617|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 24, 2013|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong=====
The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' published a poll of Hong Kong residents conducted while Snowden was still in Hong Kong that showed that half of the 509 respondents believed the Chinese government should not surrender Snowden to the United States if Washington raises such a request; 33 percent of those polled think of Snowden as a hero, 12.8 percent described him as a traitor, 36 percent said he was neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1261483/one-2-hongkongers-say-snowden-should-not-be-surrendered-us |title=Hongkongers don't want Snowden handed over to the US, according to poll |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |first=Joshua |last=But |date=June 16, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to Snowden's presence in the territory, Hong Kong chief executive [[Leung Chun Ying|Leung Chun-Ying]] assured that the government would "handle the case of Mr Snowden in accordance with the laws and established procedures of Hong Kong [and] follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of the institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1261593/cy-leung-breaks-silence-snowden-case-we-will-follow-privacy-claims |title=HK, US govt lawyers 'not working together' on Snowden, say sources as CY breaks silence |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|Pan-democrat]] legislators [[Gary Fan]] and [[Claudia Mo]] said that the perceived U.S. prosecution against Snowden will set "a dangerous precedent and will likely be used to justify similar actions" by authoritarian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/130615/hk-lawmakers-petition-obama-leniency-against-whistlebl |title=H.K. lawmakers petition Obama for leniency against whistleblower |work=Kyodo News International |date=June 13, 2013 |last=Fraser |first=Niall |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During Snowden's stay, the two main political groups, the pan-democrats and [[Pro-Beijing camp]], found rare agreement to support Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ma|first=Mary|date=June 20, 2013|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=49&amp;art_id=134784&amp;sid=39840738&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130620&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013|title=Ip in security minister's shoes|work=The Standard|location=Hong Kong|quote=However, surrounding the Snowden case is something never before seen in local politics.

[[People's Daily|The ''People's Daily'']] and the ''[[Global Times]]'' editorials of June 19 stated respectively that the central Chinese government was unwilling to be involved in a "mess" caused by others, and that the Hong Kong government should follow the public opinion and not concern itself with Sino-US relations.&lt;ref name="ZuoSCMPEditorials"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zuo|first=Mandy|date=June 20, 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1264604/newspaper-commentaries-suggest-beijing-wants-hong-kong-handle-snowden-its|title=Beijing wants Hong Kong to handle Snowden on its own, party newspapers suggest|postscript=.

After Snowden left Hong Kong, Chinese-language newspapers such as the ''[[Ming Pao]]'' and the ''[[Oriental Daily]]'' expressed relief that Hong Kong no longer had to shoulder the burden of the Snowden situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Lai Ying-kit |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268012/edward-snowdens-depature-seen-relief-chinese-language-newspapers |title=Edward Snowden's depature [sic] seen as a relief: Chinese-language newspapers |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainland experts said that, although the Central Government did not want to appear to be intervening in the matter, it was inconceivable that the Hong Kong government acted independently in a matter that could have far-reaching consequences for Sino-US relations. One expert suggested that, by doing so, China had "returned the favor" for their not having accepted the [[Wang Lijun incident|asylum plea from Wang Lijun]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Beijing made final decision, say analysts |page=2 |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the ''[[People's Daily]]'' denied the US government accusation that the PRC central government had allowed Snowden to escape, and said that Snowden helped in "tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaiman |first=Jonathan |date=June 25, 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/peoples-daily-savages-us-over-snowden |title=China's state newspaper praises Edward Snowden for 'tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask' |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2013, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Foreign Minister]] [[Anifah Aman]] summoned the ambassadors of Australia and the United States to protest an alleged American-led spying network in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia protests at 'US and Australia spying' in Asia|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24784895|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
Early in July 2013, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, [[Cecilia Malmström]], wrote to two U.S. officials that "mutual trust and confidence have been seriously eroded and I expect the U.S. to do all that it can to restore them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Union threatens to stop sharing data with United States over spying reports |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/eu-threatens-stop-sharing-data-u-s-spying-reports-article-1.1391702|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed a measure that, if enacted, would require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by NSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html "Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', October 21, 2013. Retrieved October 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Council]] meeting at the end of October 2013 in its statement signed by all 28 EU leaders while stressing that "intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism" and noting "the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership", said that this must "be based on respect and trust," a lack of which "could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU-US spying row stokes concern over anti-terror campaign |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/us-intelligence.r38|work=EU Business|date=October 26, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU says distrust of US on spying may harm terror fight |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24668286|work=BBC|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2013, the European Parliament released the results&lt;ref name="MoreasReport"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moreas|first=Claude|title=DRAFT REPORT on the US NSA surveillance programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens’ fundamental rights and on transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs.

No individual EU country has looked into the scandal this thoroughly and no EU government has been as explicit in its criticism of the US government."&lt;ref name="DW20130109" /&gt; The draft report covered the preceding six months and was, said Deutsche Welle, "hard on all sides—including governments and companies in the EU." Presented by [[Claude Moraes]], British [[Member of the European Parliament]] from the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]], the report found what it called "compelling evidence of the existence of far-reaching, complex and highly technologically advanced systems designed by US and some Member States' intelligence services to collect, store and analyze communication and location data and metadata of all citizens around the world on an unprecedented scale and in an indiscriminate and non-suspicion-based manner." The fight against terrorism, said the report, can "never in itself be a justification for untargeted, secret and sometimes even illegal mass surveillance programs."&lt;ref name="DW20130109"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haase|first=Nina|title=EU report reveals massive scope of secret NSA surveillance|url=http://www.dw.de/eu-report-reveals-massive-scope-of-secret-nsa-surveillance/a-17352243|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moreas and his fellow rapporteurs considered it "very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens; points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and [[economic espionage]]."&lt;ref name="MoreasReport"/&gt;

====France====

On October 21, 2013, France summoned [[Charles Rivkin]], the U.S. Ambassador to France, to clarify and explain the NSA's surveillance of French citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France summons U.S. ambassador over spying report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/21/us-france-nsa-idUSBRE99K04920131021|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 24, 2013|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists, President [[François Hollande]] said, "We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies.

On July 1, 2013, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Ministry]] summoned [[Philip D.

Towards the end of July, the media reported that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND), had been actively cooperating with the NSA, which sparked demonstrations in 40 German cities involving thousands of protesters all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands fill German streets to protest Berlin's NSA spying involvement|url=http://rt.com/news/germany-nsa-merkel-writers-669/|publisher=RT|location=Russia|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2013, Germany canceled largely symbolic [[Cold War]]-era administrative agreements with Britain, the United States and France, which had granted the Western countries which had troops stationed in West Germany the right to request surveillance operations to protect those forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23553837|title=Germany ends spy pact with US and UK after Snowden|publisher=BBC |date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August, under the orders of the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|German domestic intelligence agency]], a federal police helicopter conducted a low-altitude flyover of the [[Consulate General of the United States, Frankfurt|United States Consulate]] in [[Frankfurt]], apparently in search of suspected clandestine eavesdropping facilities. A German official called it a symbolic "shot across the bow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-helicopter-searched-for-nsa-listening-post-in-frankfurt-a-921257.html German Helicopter Searched For NSA Listening Post In Frankfurt] SPIEGEL ONLINE.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2013, EU heads of state met to discuss a proposed data protection law. The representatives of Italy, Poland and France wanted the law to be passed before the May 2014 European Parliament elections. Germany, represented by [[Angela Merkel]], and the UK, represented by [[David Cameron]], favored a slower implementation; their wishes prevailed. About the "[[Five Eyes]]" espionage alliance, Merkel remarked, "Unlike David, we are unfortunately not part of this group."&lt;ref&gt;

It was revealed that Germany's [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] intelligence service has covertly monitored European defence interests and politicians inside Germany at the request of the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11562072/German-spies-monitored-European-targets-for-the-US-against-German-interests.html German spies 'monitored European targets for the US against German interests']". ''The Daily Telegraph.'' 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====

Italy's Prime Minister [[Enrico Letta]] asked [[John Kerry]], the U.S. Secretary of State, to clarify if the NSA had illegally intercepted telecommunications in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy Presses Kerry Over US Surveillance|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-italy-presses-kerry-over-us-surveillance/1775519.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2013, the [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Italian Interior Minister]] [[Angelino Alfano]] told reporters, "We have a duty to [provide] clarity to Italian citizens—we must obtain the whole truth and tell the whole truth, without regard for anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letta quizzes Kerry on US spy claims|url=http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/news/english/66340/Letta-quizzes-Kerry-on-US-spy-claims.html|publisher=''[[Gazzetta del Sud]]''|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
On October 25, 2013, the Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] summoned [[James Costos]], the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, to clarify reports about the NSA's surveillance of the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spanish PM summons U.

British Foreign Minister [[William Hague]] admitted that Britain's GCHQ was also spying and collaborating with the NSA, and defended the two agencies' actions as "indispensable."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2013/jun/09/data-snooping-law-abiding-citizens-nothing-fear-hague-video "Data snooping: law-abiding citizens have 'nothing to fear', says Hague – video"].

In 2014 the [[Director of the Government Communications Headquarters|Director of GCHQ]] authored an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the topic of [[internet surveillance]], stating that "however much [large US technology companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals" and that GCHQ and its sister agencies "cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector", arguing that most internet users "would be comfortable with a better and more sustainable relationship between the [intelligence] agencies and the tech companies". Since the 2013 surveillance disclosures, large US technology companies have improved security and become less co-operative with foreign intelligence agencies, including those of the UK, generally requiring a US court order before disclosing data.&lt;ref name=ft-20141103rh&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c89b6c58-6342-11e4-8a63-00144feabdc0.html |title=The web is a terrorist's command-and-control network of choice |author=Robert Hannigan |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-20141103&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4a35c0b2-636e-11e4-9a79-00144feabdc0.html |title=Tech groups aid terror, says UK spy chief |author1=Sam Jones  |author2=Murad Ahmed  |lastauthoramp=yes |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====Mexico====
On October 24, 2013, the [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Mexican Foreign Minister]] [[José Antonio Meade Kuribreña]] met with U.S. Ambassador [[Earl Anthony Wayne]] to discuss allegations reported by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that the NSA hacked the emails of former president [[Felipe Calderón]] while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico foreign minister meets US envoy over spy claims|url=http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/Mexico-foreign-minister-meets-US-envoy-over-spy-claims/-/1950946/2047620/-/format/xhtml/-/g9qrh7/-/index.html|publisher=AFP|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===

===Australia===
Former [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Foreign Minister]] [[Bob Carr]] remarked that the U.S. would be critical of any other nation that failed to prevent the release of such sensitive documents. "Certainly if it had gone the other way," said Carr, "if there'd been some official in Canberra, some contractor in Canberra, who allowed a slew of material as sensitive as this to be plastered over the world's media, America would be saying very stern things to someone they'd be regarding as a woefully immature ally and partner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-19/indonesia-gives-australia-two-days-to-explain-spying-row/5101050 Spying row: Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accuses Tony Abbott of taking claims too lightly]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
On November 1, 2013, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Foreign Ministry]] of Indonesia summoned [[Australia]]'s Ambassador Greg Moriarty to explain his country's surveillance of President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] and other Indonesian political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia Summons Australian Ambassador Over US Spying Allegations|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/indonesia-summons-australian-ambassador-over-us-spying-allegations/1781254.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, the Australian ambassador was summoned again by Indonesian government officials, who pledged to review all types of cooperation with Australia. The Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Marty Natalegawa]] called the spying "unacceptable", and added that "This is an unfriendly, unbecoming act between strategic partners." The Indonesian ambassador to Australia was also recalled as a response to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=George Roberts|title=Indonesia recalls ambassador after leaked documents reveal Australia spied on president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-18/indonesia-angered-by-revelations-australia-spied-on-sby/5100264|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
[[File:Greenwald and Miranda at Congress.jpg|thumb|Glenn Greenwald (right) and his partner, Brazilian David Miranda (left), speaking to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] of Brazil about U.S. spying activity in that country.]]
The Brazilian government expressed outrage at the revelations that the National Security Agency directly targeted the communications of president [[Dilma Rousseff]] and her top aides.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/americas/brazil-angered-over-report-nsa-spied-on-president.html?_r=0 |title=Brazil Angered Over Report N.S.A.

====Ecuador====
[[Ecuador]] responded by renouncing U.S. trade benefits and offering to pay a similar amount, $23 million per year, to finance human rights training in America to help avoid what Ecuador's Foreign Minister [[Ricardo Patiño]] called "violations of privacy, torture and other actions that are denigrating to humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/27/us-usa-security-ecuador-idUSBRE95Q0L820130627 |title= Ecuador offers U.S. rights aid, waives trade benefits |agency=Reuters |date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1270475/ecuador-waives-us-trade-rights-after-threats-made-over-snowden-case |title=Ecuador waives US trade rights after threats made over Snowden case |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=June 28, 2013 |location= Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Index on Censorship====
London-based [[Index on Censorship]] called upon the U.S. government to uphold the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], saying, "The mass surveillance of citizens' private communications is unacceptable—it both invades privacy and threatens freedom of expression. The US government cannot use the excuse of national security to justify either surveillance on this scale or the extradition of Snowden for revealing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US needs to protect whistleblowers and journalists|url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/06/us-needs-to-protect-whistleblowers-and-journalists/|publisher=[[Index on Censorship]]|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Nations ====
In July 2013, speaking to the foreign affairs committee of the [[Althing|Icelandic Parliament]] in [[Reykjavík]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] said that in his personal opinion, Edward Snowden had misused his right to digital access and created problems that outweigh the benefits of public disclosure. [[Birgitta Jónsdóttir]], an Icelandic legislator who in 2010 assisted [[WikiLeaks]] in publishing U.S. state secrets leaked by [[Chelsea Manning]], expressed alarm at Ban's remarks. She said that he "seemed entirely unconcerned about the invasion of privacy by governments around the world, and only concerned about how whistleblowers are misusing the system."&lt;ref name="PilkingtonBan"&gt;Pilkington, Ed. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/edward-snowden-digital-misuse-ban-ki-moon Edward Snowden's digital 'misuse' has created problems, says Ban Ki-moon]." ''[[The Guardian]]''.

In ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' episode "[[The Blacklist episodes|The Alchemist (No. 101)]]" (season 1, episode 12, minutes 00:22:00-00:22:55), one of the technical experts Red tasked to reconstitute documents shredded by American governmental agencies reports: "We actually reached out to the Germans for help.

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Schøyen Collection''' is the largest private [[manuscript]] collection in the world, mostly located in [[Oslo]] and London. Formed in the 20th century by [[Martin Schøyen]], it comprises manuscripts of global [[provenance]], spanning 5,000 years of history. It contains more than 13,000 manuscript items; the oldest is about 5,300 years old. There are manuscripts from 134 different countries and territories, representing 120 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/aboutus.html ''The Schøyen Collection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of manuscripts—geographic, linguistic, textual and material—even more than its size makes the Schøyen Collection unique. The collection has a website with many items illustrated and described. The provenance of the various cuneiform materials held by the Schøyen Collection remains subject to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html|title=Review of: The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts, 2 vols|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=BMCR|via=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).]]
{{International relations theory sidebar}}
In [[world-systems theory]], the '''semi-periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the semi-periphery''') are the [[industrialization|industrializing]], mostly [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country|countries]] which are positioned between [[periphery countries|the periphery]] and [[core countries]]. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall.''The Seedbed of Change''.Chapter 5 of C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=terlouw&gt;Terlouw 1992 pg 136-145&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller&gt;Wallerstein 1976, pp. 229-233&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

Today, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2&gt;Wallerstein 1974 Vol.3, No.4., pp 461-483&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; More land mass typically means an increased market size and share.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as [[Israel]], Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
Semi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: [[periphery countries]] and [[core countries]]. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent,&lt;ref name="Chirot"&gt;Chirot. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization.&lt;ref name="Chirot"/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A.&lt;/ref&gt; The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.&lt;ref name="waller" /&gt;

===Function===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
The semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income [[periphery countries|peripheral states]] and the high-income [[core countries|core states]] by adding another step in the world system hierarchy.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the [[Core countries|core]] and the [[Periphery countries|periphery]].&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

Semi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

The semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological [[structural functionalism]] theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D. Hall. 1982. 8:81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt;

[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[silk road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]This era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;  In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the [[Mongols]], allowed them to be fairly impenetrable [[trade]] obstacles.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; [[Geography]] also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive [[maritime industry]].  Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a "hinge" between the [[East]] and [[West]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1300–1450===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes.]]

Following increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the [[feudal system]] met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall 1997, pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the [[Black Plague]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Far East]], the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the [[Crusades]] through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa also assisted the [[Byzantine Empire]] when it helped recapture the capital, [[Constantinople]], in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to [[Core countries|core]] status until its fall in 1453.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

During this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of [[laissez-faire]] government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa never fully recovered from the [[Black Death]] and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the [[Red Sea]] trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1450–1700===
[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|460px|The areas of the world that at one time were territories of the Spanish Empire.]]
  
In a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; At the base of this world system was an [[international division of labor]] that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the [[Netherlands]], gained the most from the world economy.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; [[Slaves]] and indigenous workers in these regions developed [[raw materials]] for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The [[aristocracy]] of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

In between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic [[manufacturing]] sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1700–1875===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|300px|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies]]
The development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small [[merchant]] elite in the European colonial powers.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of [[agriculture]] and other industries.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The end result was the development of the necessary capital to [[industrialize]] the European core states.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

This era was defined by the transition from agriculture to [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

Throughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of [[manufacturing]] in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1875–1914===
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|A ration party of the Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench.]] The [[West]] represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt;

===1914–today===

This trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the [[semi-periphery]] along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the [[semi-periphery]], with the exception of many [[Eastern European]] nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where [[American imperialism]] led to the rise of countries like [[Guatemala]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.

In today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the [[Americas]], Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, Timothy M. ''The Review of Black Political Economy'': pp. 341-358.
[http://www.springerlink.com/content/2118h2x63n84u170/]&lt;/ref&gt; The new leading powers are mostly non-European (United States, Canada, Japan). Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished [[Fourth World]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Other terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like [[Brazil]], South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like [[Iran]] and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zaire]], [[Senegal]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; These countries use [[dependency theory|dependent development]] to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Wallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high [[Profit (economics)|profits]], high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

These economic downturns occur because of increased [[supply (economics)|supply]] and decreased [[demand]], which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of [[scarcity]]. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|A ballot box]]
The semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This "middle ground" between the very powerful [[Core countries|cores]] and the backwaters of the far [[Periphery countries|periphery]] allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the [[Pax Mongolica|13th-century world system]], the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based [[Flanders|Northern Europe]] and the cores of India and China.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; John Markoff, a [[sociology|sociologist]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of [[democracy]], originate in the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable [[First World|core nations]], where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor [[Third World|periphery]] where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;Markoff, John. 1999-1041:4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3pillars originofpoliticalorder.gif|thumb|The three components/pillars of a stable state according to Fukuyama]]
'''''The Origins of Political Order''''' is a 2011 book by [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] about what makes a state stable. It uses a comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, a stable state needs to be modern and strong, to obey the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}

The book is the first of two books on the development of [[Political system|political order]]. This book goes from its origins to the [[French Revolution]]. The next book ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day]]'', published in September 2014, starts with the French Revolution and carries the analysis to the present day.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=furedi/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewson&gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy]]''. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why states and institutions fail==
The book is an attempt to understand why modern statebuilding and the building of institutions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia have failed to live up to expectations.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|loc=Preface}}

In the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US administration seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=13}}

The book is about "getting to Denmark," in other words creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and honest societies.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|title=''How To Get to the End of History or "getting to Denmark"'' review|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/05/how_to_get_to_the_end_of_history.html |work=Slate|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama points out that at the time of writing ninety contemporary 'primitive' societies had been engaged in war,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=73}} suggesting that political order is preferable to primitive social structures if stability is to be achieved. The author describes how attempts at shaping countries outside the western world into western type democracies failed, and that this book was an attempt to find out why, by trying to find the true origins of political order, by tracing the histories of China, India, Europe and some Muslim countries from the point of view of three components.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312}}

==Aims==
Since the aim of the book is to understand how institutions and states develop in different countries, it is also a book on [[comparative historical research]].

It is an extension of [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Political Order in Changing Societies]]'' and similar in scope to [[Jared Diamond]]’s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name=sailer&gt;{{cite web|title= Fukuyama's World  |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fukuyamas-world/ |work=The American Conservative|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama develops his argument with respect to the history of China, India and the Middle East before focusing on the way European countries developed in a variety of directions.&lt;ref name=blackburn&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Robert|title=''The Origins of Political Order'' review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution-by-francis-fukuyama-2283020.html |work=The Independent|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From pre-human origins to states==

===From chimpanzee hunting groups to tribes===
In his quest for the origins of political order, he first looks at the social order among chimpanzees, notes that the war-like hunting group, rather than the family, was the primary social group, and claims the same for humans. Humans went further: to survive they formed tribes, whose armies were superior to hunting groups by their sheer size.&lt;ref name= hewson &gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=

He uses recent work in sociobiology and other sources to show that sociability built on kin selection and reciprocal altruism is the original default social state of man and not any isolated, presocial human as suggested by [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Michael|title=''Francis Fukuyama's Theory of the State'' review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-origins-of-political-order-by-francis-fukuyama.html?pagewanted=all |work=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=439}} He suggests that Hobbes and Locke present a fallacy when they argue humans developed cooperative ability only as a result of the invention of the state. This is because chimps, the genetic ancestors to humans, engage in kin relations based on cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Waal|first1=Frans|title=Chimpanzee Politics|date=2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Hobbes and Locke must be suggesting humans were once sociable, lost this instinct and then regained it due to the state.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=34}}

===Challenge of tribes on the road towards the state===
The next step was to escape beyond tribalism and the "tyranny of cousins", to join tribes into larger coalitions&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt; towards states, again due to the advantage of larger armies. This was done with the aid of religion.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt; This was because as groups grew in size, maintaining cooperation became more difficult as face-to-face interactions with much of society became difficult. Religion offered a way of providing a combining social force to hold society together .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=37}} For example, Fukuyama cites [[Mohammed]] as an example of what Weber labels a "[[charismatic leader]]" because he used the idea of an '[[umma]]' (community of believers) to bind together the territory that he ruled over .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=87}} This challenge to transcend tribalism partly remains today in many parts of the world that is outside Western civilization, for example in Afghanistan and in Somalia.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt;

====Restrictions on marriage and inheritance as a strategy against corruption====
Loyalty to the tribe or the family, rather than to the state, leads to corruption and weakening of the state. Various strategies were used to overcome the corruption. One such strategy was restrictions against marriage among the ruling official class to make sure that loyalties would not lie with family or tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarins or [[Scholar-official]]s, who were the ruling class of China, were not allowed to pass on the lands given to them by the emperor to their own children and were restricted as to whom they were allowed to marry.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=116,367}}

[[Mamluk]] slaves, the ruling class of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, were told which slaves to marry while their children could not inherit from them.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=198}}[[Jannissary|Jannisarries]] were originally forced into celibacy or and prohibited from having a family.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=219}}{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=225}}

[[Pope Gregory VII]] forced Catholic priests in Europe to become celibate and they were prohibited from having a family for the same reason.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=264}}

Spanish administrators in South America were restricted from to marrying local women and from establishing family ties in the territories they were sent to.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=367}}

==Three components of political order==
The books develops the idea of the development of the three components of a modern political order, which are,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}
# '''[[State (polity)#The modern state|State building]]'''
# '''[[Rule of law]]'''
# '''Accountable government'''

[[China]], [[India]], the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and Europe each developed these three components of political organization in different order, in different ways and to different degrees. Denmark and the United Kingdom arrived first at a modern balance of the three components in a single package, follow by others by the nineteenth century, as the Netherlands and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}

[[File:Fukuyama article2.png|thumb|Origins of Political Order depend on three components, according to Fukuyama. States with all three components, are more stable, and are shown in the middle.]]

===China===
China is described as having the first modern state,&lt;ref name=econom1&gt;{{cite web|title=''The good, the great and the gelded'' review|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18483257 |work=The Economist|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the definition given, since it established an educated Mandarin bureaucracy, although Hewson objects to this conclusion since the Mandarin bureaucracy was not modern.&lt;ref name=hewson/&gt; China used extreme violence on its population (especially during the influence of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=120}}), but had a weak rule of law and the emperor had no accountability to anyone.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

===India===
India is contrasted with China. India could not use extreme force on its population due to the traditional power of the [[brahmin]] [[priestly caste]], who protested violence against the populace and war against neighboring states, by refusing to perform ancestral rituals for the [[Raja]] leaders. The power of the Brahmins weakening the state's power over its people, and effectively forced a strong accountability on its leaders to the population of India via its priestly class.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=158-167}} An example Fukuyama gives of the influence religion had on early Indian rulers is [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) of the [[Maurya Dynasty]], who under the influence of Buddhism (rather than Brahmanism) came to regret his conquests in the Kalinga War. He vowed to end his empire, and eventually the entire political system collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=182}}

===Muslim states===
Certain Muslim states developed the practice of making imported slaves as the ruling class, as with the [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt and the Janissaries of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, a process which started around the 8th century. Since these ruling class slaves were neither beholden to family nor to any tribe, but dependent only on the state, it ensured their loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=218-219}} A later example would be the 16th-century Ottoman Empire practice of seeking out intelligent Christian children for high civil service or military positions, who were cut off from their family for their training.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=190}}

===Europe===
In 11th-century Europe, instead of the state having the upper hand as in China, or the Brahmins having the upper hand as in India, there was a power conflict between state and church, the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266}}

The papal party started to search for sources of law to strengthen its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. They rediscovered the Justinian Code, the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]], in a library near Bologna in northern Italy in 1072, leading later to the student body called a "universitas", first in Bologna, and soon after in Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen studying the code and displacing particularistic Salic law.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=268-269}} The laws gave the Gregory the authority to [[excommunicate]] Henry IV, who was forced to [[walk to Canossa]] from Germany to Italy, stand barefoot{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=168}} in the snow for three days{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=265}} outside Canossa and to ask forgiveness from the pope on his knees.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=268}} The [[Concordat of Worms]] ended the struggle between popes and emperors in 1122. It created balance between royal power and religious tradition not seen anywhere else before.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

Catholic leaders became accountable to the clergy and to the pope, who historically frequently objected to violence and wars, just as their counterparts in India had done, but in Europe the clergy did not weaken the states as much as Brahmins had done in India. The papal intercessions against wars between Catholic countries also led to the survival of small states in Europe, similar to India, but in contrast to what had happened in China. The existence of small states who were restricted by the church from recruiting mass armies waging wars costly in casualties, as had been the case in China, combined with the existence of independent university scholars, led to military innovations on land and sea to empower fewer soldiers to wield wars effectively and later gave these relatively small countries a military advantage large enough to conquer colonies in the rest of the world. Western Europe began getting the best of both worlds. In England, the rise of common law also strengthened the rule of law. With the reformation, the Lutheran priest N.F.S. Grundtvig in Denmark advocated general literacy since they believed that every Christian should read the bible and established schools throughout the country, leading to voting rights 1849.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;434}} In Denmark this led to the state gradually being more accountable to the general population, since they could now vote and read. In England and Denmark a balance was finally struck between the three components of political order.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;269}}

==Balance between the components==
A successful modern liberal democracy balances all three components to achieve stability.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=6,188}}

In China a strong modern state came to power first and the state subjugated any potential agents that might have demanded the other two components. In China, the priestly class did not develop into an organized independent religion, as the priests were in the service of the Emperor. Numerous times, therefore, imperial dynasties collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=151}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In India, the Brahmins became organised into a strong upper caste of India and the warrior/state caste was held to account by a rule of law as interpreted by the Brahmins. Because of the state was weakened by this limitation, attempts at unifying India under one rule did not last very long.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=183}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In Europe, there was a long period when the emperors and popes were in conflict, creating a balance of power between them,&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; and ultimately leading to a situation where some small states developed a stable balance between the three components in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

'''Time–space compression''' (also known as '''space–time compression''' and '''time–space distantiation'''), articulated in 1989 by geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] in ''The Condition of [[Postmodernity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. ''The Condition of Postmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change''. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to anything that impacts time and space. Harvey's idea was rooted in Karl Marx's theory of the "annihilation of time and space". A similar idea was proposed by [[Elmar Alvater]] in an article in ''[[PROKLA]]'' in 1987 translated into English as "Ecological and Economic Modalities of Time and Space" and published in ''[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]]'', 1(3) in 1989.

Time–space compression often occurs as a result of technological innovations including technology of communication and economics. 

According to theorists like [[Paul Virilio]], time-space compression is an essential facet of contemporary life: "Today we are entering a space which is speed-space ... This new other time is that of electronic transmission, of high-tech machines, and therefore, man is present in this sort of time, not via his physical presence, but via programming" (qtd. in ''Decron'' 71&lt;ref&gt;Decron, Chris. ''Speed-Space.''  Virilio Live. Ed. John Armitage. London: Sage, 2001. 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''"Vitesse et Politique"'', Virilio  coins the term '''dromology''' to describe "speed-space." Virilio describes velocity as the hidden side of wealth and power, which represents a determining factor concerning societies' structures. Historical eras and political events, out of this perspective, are also speed-ratios. In his view, acceleration destroys space and compresses the time in ways of perceiving reality.

[[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]] maintains this idea about time-space compression in her discussion of globalization and its effect on our society. Similar to Virilio, she states that because our world is "speeding up" and "spreading out", time-space compression is more prevalent than ever as [[internationalization]] takes place. Cultures and communities are merged during time-space compression due to rapid growth and change, as "layers upon layers" of histories fuse together to shift our ideas of what the identity of a "place" should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Doreen |authorlink=Doreen Massey (geographer)|chapter=A Global Sense of Place|title=Space, Place, and Gender|date=1994 |ISBN= 0816626162|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists generally identify two historical periods in which time–space compression occurred; the period from the mid-19th century to the beginnings of the [[First World War]], and the end of the 20th century. In both of these time periods, according to Jon May and Nigel Thrift, "there occurred a radical restructuring in the nature and experience of both time and space ... both periods saw a significant acceleration in the pace of life concomitant with a dissolution or collapse of traditional spatial co-ordinates".&lt;ref&gt;May, Jon and [[Nigel Thrift]]. "Introduction." ''TimeSpace: Geographies of Temporality''. NY: Routledge, 2001. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

For [[Moishe Postone]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Postone, Moishe]]. "Theorizing the Contemporary World: Robert Brenner, Giovanni Arrighi, David Harvey" in ''Political Economy of the Present and Possible Global Future(s)'', Anthem Press&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey's treatment of space-time compression and postmodern diversity are as merely reactions to [[capitalism]].  Hence Harvey's analysis remains "extrinsic to the [[social form]]s expressed" by the deep structure concepts of capital, value and the [[commodity]].

For Postone the postmodern moment is not necessarily just a one-sided effect of the contemporary form of capitalism but can also be seen as having an emancipatory side if it happened to be part of a post-capitalism.  And because postmodernism usually neglects its own context of embeddedness it can legitimate capitalism as postmodern, whereas at the level of deep structure it may in fact be more concentrated, with large capitals that, accumulate rather than diverge, and with an expansion of commodification niches with fewer buyers.

Postone asserts one cannot step outside capitalism and declare it a pure evil, or as a one-dimensional badness.  For Postone, the [[emancipatory]] content of such things as equal distribution or diversity are potentials of capitalism itself in its abundant and diverse productive powers.  It misfires however, when a form of life such as postmodernism takes itself for being the whole when in fact it is just another appearance of the same capitalist essence.

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J.

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope''' was a worldwide benefit held for the [[tsunami]] victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. It was broadcast on [[NBC]] and its affiliated networks of [[USA Networks|USA Network]],  [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], [[PAX Network|PAX]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNBC]], [[Sci-Fi (United States)|Sci-Fi]], [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]], [[Telemundo]] and other [[NBC Universal]] stations and was heard on any [[Clear Channel]] radio station. The benefit was led by the actor [[George Clooney]] on January 15, 2005, and was similar to ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' (set up after the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]]).  Digital Media innovator [[Jay Samit]] enabled viewers to purchase digital downloads of the performances as a new way to raise money for the cause; including live recordings by [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Roger Waters]].  Taking a cue from [[Bob Geldof]] (the man who had organized the [[Live Aid]] concerts for African famine relief), it consisted of famous Hollywood entertainers and former American presidents [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]].  It was two hours long with stories and entertainment from a huge array of Hollywood popstars notables that include [[Brad Pitt]], [[Donald Trump]], and much more.  It was estimated to raise at least five million dollars by the end of the broadcast.

[[File:Voice of America Bethany Relay Station.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting is the main building and campus of the original VOA, Bethany Relay Station.]]
'''The [[Voice of America]]'s Bethany Relay Station''' was located in [[Butler County, Ohio]]'s [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] about 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], adjacent to the transmitter site of [[WLW]]. Starting in 1944 during [[World War II]] it transmitted American radio programming abroad on [[shortwave]] frequencies, using 200,000-watt transmitters built by [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation|Crosley]] engineers under the direction of R.J. Rockwell. The site was developed to provide 'fallback' transmission facilities inland and away from the East Coast, where transmitters were located in Massachusetts, on Long Island in New York, and in New Jersey, all close to the ocean, subject to attack from German submarines or other invading forces.

Programming originated from studios in New York until 1954, when VOA headquarters moved to Washington.

The station operated until 1994. The facility took its name from the [[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio|Liberty Township]] community of [[Bethany, Ohio|Bethany]], which was about two miles north of the facility.

==History==
In 1943, the United States government bought nearly all of [[section (land)|Section]] 12 of Township 3, Range 2 of the [[Symmes Purchase]], the northeasternmost section of Union Township. From Hazel Beckley, 170 acres (688,000 m²) were purchased; from Philip Condon, 143 acres (579,000 m²); from Lola Gray Coy, 100 acres (405,000 m²); from John Miller, 69 acres (279,000 m²); and from Suzie Steinman, 142 acres (575,000 m²). The site was chosen for its elevation and its shallow bedrock and is today bounded by Tylersville Road on the south, Cox Road to the west, Liberty Way to the north, and [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]]-[[Warren County, Ohio|Warren]] Road.

The transmitters were built by [[Powel Crosley Jr.]]'s [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] about one mile west of the company's tower for [[WLW-AM]] in [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]]. The [[Office of War Information]] began broadcasting in July 1944 and [[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have denounced the "Cincinnati liars". Following the war, with the OWI abolished, the facility was taken over by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in 1945. It became part of the newly created [[United States Information Agency]] in 1953. The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation operated the facility for the government until November 1963, when the Voice of America assumed direct control.

At its peak the facility had six transmitters broadcasting with 250&amp;nbsp;kW and two transmitting with 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

The facility was closed on November 14, 1994; because of changing technologies, the transmissions shifted to [[satellite]]s. The towers were brought down from December 1997 to February 1998.

==Post-closing use==
Most of the land was turned over to the [[Butler County, Ohio|county]] and [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|township]] for use as a [[park]].

Part in the southwest corner was sold to developers who have erected a shopping center called the Voice of America Centre.

The [[Miami University Voice of America Learning Center]] opened on the site in January 2009.

==National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting==
The 30,000 sq. ft. former Bethany Station building at 8070 Tylersville Road is being transformed into the National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting, a historical center about the history of The Voice of America, radio and television.

Using a blueprint developed by Jack Rouse Associates, the facility features displays and interactive experiences that relate the story of the Voice of America and incorporate other related collections from Media Heritage and the Gray History of Wireless Museum in [[Cincinnati]].

Displays include the radio station control room, re-creations of radio and television studios from the 1920s through the present, [[Old-time radio]] memorabilia and from the early days of television, and displays about area pioneers in the development of radio technology.

An amateur radio club West Chester Amateur Radio Association, also operates a station using the callsign WC8VOA.

'''World War I''' (often abbreviated as '''WWI''' or '''WW1'''), also known as the '''First World War''' or the '''Great War''', was a [[global war]] originating in [[Europe]] that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as the "[[war to end all wars]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 November 1998 |title=The war to end all wars |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/198172.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; it led to the mobilisation of more than 70&amp;nbsp;million [[military personnel]], including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=8}}{{sfn |Bade |Brown |2003 |pp=167–168}} An estimated nine million [[combatants]] and seven million [[civilian]]s [[World War I casualties|died as a direct result of the war]], and it also contributed to [[Genocides in history#World War I through World War II|later genocides]] and the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza pandemic]], which caused between 50 and 100 million deaths worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Rachel |title=Dual Threat: The Spanish Influenza and World War I |date=2014 |publisher=Trace: Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange |location=University of Tennessee Thesis |pages=4–10 |url=https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2761&amp;context=utk_chanhonoproj |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military losses were exacerbated by new technological and industrial developments and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling [[trench warfare]]. It was [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|one of the deadliest conflicts in history]] and precipitated major political changes, including the [[Revolutions of 1917–1923]], in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict [[Causes of World War II|contributed to the start of World War II]] about twenty years later.{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=307}}

On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] [[Yugoslav nationalist]], [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], leading to the [[July Crisis]].&lt;ref name="AJPT2"&gt;{{harvnb |Taylor |1998 |pp=80–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Djokić |2003 |p=24}} In response, on 23 July Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Serbia's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians, and the two moved to a war footing.

A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe. By 1914, the [[great powers]] of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the [[Triple Entente]]—consisting of [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]]—and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] (the Triple Alliance was primarily defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war in 1914).&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Diplomatic Background of the War |author=Charles Seymour |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=1916 |pages=35, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia, on 25 July issuing orders for the 'period preparatory to war', and after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of [[Belgrade]] on the 28th, partial mobilisation was approved of the military districts nearest to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieven |first1=Dominic |title=Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141399744 |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July; on the 31st, Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same, while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martel |first1=Gordon |title=The Month that Changed the World: July 1914 and WWI |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |location=6286 |edition=Kindle |ref=B00K79UOPK}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia failed to comply, Germany declared war on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary, with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6th; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Le Président de la République, R.

German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within four weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zuber |first1=Terence |title=Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 |date=2011 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0198718055 |pages=46–49 |edition=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August, Germany demanded [[German invasion of Belgium|free passage through Belgium]], an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Note Given 2 August 1914, at 19 hours, by M. de Below Saleske [Klaus von Below-Saleske], Minister of Germany, to M.

The war was fought in and drew upon each powers' colonial empires as well, spreading the conflict across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary and Germany would become known as the [[Central Powers]].

The German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] was marked by much greater exchanges of territory, but though [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbia was defeated in 1915]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the Allied Powers in 1916 [[Romania during World War I|only to be defeated in 1917]], none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers. After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by German submarines, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that the Germans were trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|US declared war on Germany]] on 6 April 1917.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent at the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. The offensive was initially successful, but the Allied Powers rallied and drove the Germans back in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice—the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918. On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]].&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918" /&gt; On 4 November, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]]. With its allies defeated, [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolution]] at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] abdicated on 9 November and Germany also signed an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice on 11 November 1918]].

World War I was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. As a result of the war, the Russian Empire, the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist. Revolutions and uprisings in the aftermath of the war became widespread, being mainly socialist or anti-colonial in nature. The [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The formation of the [[League of Nations]] was intended to prevent another [[world war]], but for various reasons failed to do so. The rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and their central role in [[World War II]] led to a focus on how the [[Treaty of Versailles]] affected Germany, but the peace treaties in addition to various secret agreements during the war also transformed borders throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with repercussions that still echo to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerwath |first1=Robert |title=The Vanquished: Why the First World War Failed to End, 1917–1923 |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |location=3323–3342 |isbn=978-0141976372 |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "First World War" was first used in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]], who claimed that "there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'&amp;nbsp;... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"{{sfn |Shapiro |Epstein |2006 |p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' on 20 September 1914.

Prior to [[World War II]], the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the '''Great War''' or simply the '''World War'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Were they always called World War I and World War II? |url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/were-they-always-called-world-war-i-and-world-war-ii |website=Ask History |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Braybon |2004 |p=8}} Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as "[[the war to end war]]" or "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale and devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/198172.stm |title=The war to end all wars |publisher=BBC News |date=10 November 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with British Empire historians, including Canadians, favouring "The First World War" and Americans "World War I".&lt;ref&gt;Margery Fee and Janice McAlpine. ''Guide to Canadian English Usage''. (Oxford UP, 1997), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1914, the Canadian magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/81104 |title=great, adj., adv., and n |website=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while certainly accurate in Canada, this was not so even in Britain; historian [[John Holland Rose]]'s 1911 account of the 1793–1815 wars against France was titled ''William Pitt and the Great War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holland Rose |first1=John |title=William Pitt and the Great War |date=1911 |publisher=Amazon Media EU S.à r.l. |asin=B0082P4MSQ |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was validated by Gareth Glover's 2015 book, ''Waterloo in 100 Objects'', in which he states: "This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914–18 First World War. But to anyone living before 1918, the title of the Great War was applied to the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glover |first1=Gareth |title=Waterloo in 100 Objects |date=2015 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7509-6289-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, "The Great War" was historically used for the 1618–1648 [[Thirty Years' War]], also known as the "Great German War" or "Great Schism". One of the longest and most destructive conflicts in human history, it resulted in eight million fatalities from military action, violence, famine and plague, the vast majority of them in the German states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter |title=Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War |date=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-100614-7 |page=787 |edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, it was only surpassed by the period from January to May 1945; its enduring visibility is partly the result of 19th-century [[Pan-Germanism]], as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and a driver in the 1871 creation of the {{lang|de|Deutsches Kaiserreich}} or [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cramer |first1=Kevin |title=The Thirty Years' War and German Memory in the Nineteenth Century (Studies in War, Society, and the Military) |date=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-1562-7 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of terminology, the Thirty Years' War remains the single greatest war trauma in German memory, as demonstrated in debates over naming conventions during the centenary of 1914–1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 October 2014 |title=Der Dreißigjährige Krieg – die Urkatastrophe der deutschen Geschichte? |language=German |periodical=Der Teckbote |url=https://www.teckbote.de/datenschutz_artikel,-neidlingen-im-grossen-friedenswerk-von-1648-_arid,84911.html |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}

===Political and military alliances===
[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Map of Europe focusing on Austria-Hungary and marking central location of ethnic groups in it including Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles.|Rival military coalitions in 1914: [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in brown. Only the Triple Alliance was a formal "alliance"; the others listed were informal patterns of support.]]

For much of the 19th century, the major European powers had tried to maintain a tenuous [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] among themselves, resulting in a complex network of political and military alliances.{{sfn |Clark |2014 |pp=121–152}} The biggest challenges to this were Britain's withdrawal into so-called [[splendid isolation]], the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] and the post-1848 rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] under [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Victory in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] established Prussian hegemony in Germany, while victory over France in the 1870–1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] [[Unification of Germany|unified]] the German states into a [[German Empire|German Reich]] under Prussian leadership.

In 1873, to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877–1878 [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]] and their influence in the [[Balkans]], the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]; this became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] when Italy joined in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Willmott, [https://books.google.com/books/about/World_War_I.html?id=4hJgOQAACAAJ ''World War I''], Dorling Kindersley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Keegan |1998 |p=52}}

The practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three Imperial Powers and isolate France. Attempts by Britain in 1880 to resolve colonial tensions with Russia and diplomatic moves by France led to Bismarck reforming the League in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Medlicott |first1=W.N. |title=Bismarck and the Three Emperors' Alliance, 1881–87 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |date=1945 |volume=27 |pages=66–70 |doi=10.2307/3678575 |jstor=3678575}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the League finally lapsed in 1887, it was replaced by the [[Reinsurance Treaty]], a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.

In 1890, the new German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], forced Bismarck to retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by the new [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Leo von Caprivi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keenan |first1=George |title=The Fateful Alliance: France, Russia and the Coming of the First World War |date=1986 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0719017070 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed France to counteract the Triple Alliance with the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894 and the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Britain, while in 1907 Britain and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. The agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the [[Triple Entente]].&lt;ref name=Willmott15&gt;{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms race===
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-23, Linienschiff "SMS Rheinland".jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|{{SMS|Rheinland}}, a {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}, Germany's first response to the British ''Dreadnought'']]

Victory in the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the creation of the [[German Empire|German Reich]] led to a massive increase in Germany's economic and industrial strength. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Wilhelm II, who became Emperor in 1890, sought to use that to create a ''Kaiserliche Marine'' or [[Imperial German Navy]] to compete with Britain's [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.&lt;ref name=willmott21/&gt; Their rationale was based on the ideas of US naval strategist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Mahan]], who argued that whoever ruled the sea also ruled the world; Tirpitz had Mahan's books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his officers.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Herwig,"The Failure of German Sea Power, 1914–1945: Mahan, Tirpitz, and Raeder Reconsidered", ''The International History Review'', 10:1 (February 1988), 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wilhelm annoyed his ministers by publicly declaring one motive to be his childhood admiration of the Royal Navy, which he had visited "with kind aunts and friendly admirals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moll, Kendall |first1=Luebbert, Gregory |title=Arms Race and Military Expenditure Models: A Review |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=1980 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=153–185 |jstor=173938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]. With the launch of {{HMS |Dreadnought |1906 |6}} in 1906, the Royal Navy increased its advantage over its German rival and continued to do so.&lt;ref name=willmott21&gt;{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, the German economy could no longer support both naval expansion and the largest permanent army in Europe, with Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] acknowledging defeat. In many ways, it was a strategic disaster for Germany, diverting huge resources to create a navy large enough to antagonise Britain but not defeat it.

Ending the naval arms race reduced tensions between Britain and Germany but did not lead to reductions elsewhere; in 1913, Germany approved an increase in its standing army by 170,000 men, Russia committed to another 500,000 men over the next three years, while France extended compulsory military service from two to three years. Between 1870 and 1914, total military spending by Austria, Germany, Italy, and Russia increased from [[Pound sterling|£]]94 million to £394 million (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|0.394|1914}} billion in {{Inflation/year|UK}}). The largest proportional increases occurred in Germany (+73%) and Russia (+39%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Poon |first1=H.W. |title=Militarism; the Arms Race |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~salvador/Spring%20thru%20February/World%20War%201/Causes%20of%20World%20War%20I,%20Militarism.pdf |website=The Corner; World War I |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts in the Balkans===
[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of large white building with one signs saying "Moritz Schiller" and another in Arabic; in front is a cluster of people looking at poster on the wall.|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the [[Bosnian Crisis|Austrian annexation in 1908]]]]

In October 1908, Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|had occupied]] since 1878. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]]. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the "[[powder keg of Europe]]".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=48–49}}

In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent [[Albania]]n state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], by the end of which it lost most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Serbia and Greece, and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania, further destabilising the region.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |pp=2–23}} The [[Great Powers]] were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

==Prelude==

===Sarajevo assassination===
{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}
[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb |This picture is usually associated with the arrest of [[Gavrilo Princip]], although some&lt;ref name="FinestoneMassie"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Finestone |first2=Robert K. |last2=Massie |title=The last courts of Europe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-1cvAAAAMAAJ |page=247}} |year=1981 |publisher=Dent |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith |2010}} believe it depicts Ferdinand Behr, a bystander.]]

On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir presumptive to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], and [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied with arms by the Serbian [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade was to pass, with the intention of assassinating him. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces, which Austria-Hungary had annexated from the Ottoman Empire, so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia.

Čabrinović threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Ferdinand's convoy carried on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.

About an hour later, when Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, Princip stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Although they were reportedly not personally close, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was profoundly shocked and upset. The reaction among the people in Austria, however, was mild, almost indifferent. As historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]] later wrote, "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday (28 and 29 June), the crowds in [[Vienna]] listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo |title=European powers maintain focus despite killings in Sarajevo &amp;nbsp;– This Day in History |date=30 June 1914 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=26}} Nevertheless, the political impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and was described by historian [[Christopher Clark]] on the BBC Radio 4 series ''Month of Madness'' as a "[[September 11 attacks#Effects|9/11 effect]], a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna."&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark 2014"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Month of Madness |first=Christopher |last=Clark |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t7p27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austro-Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent [[anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo]], in which [[Bosnian Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]] killed two [[Bosnian Serbs]] and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.&lt;ref name="DjordjevićSpence1992"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dimitrije |last1=Djordjević |first2=Richard B. |last2=Spence |title=Scholar, patriot, mentor: historical essays in honor of Dimitrije Djordjević |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CDJpAAAAMAAJ |page=313}} |year=1992 |publisher=East European Monographs |isbn=978-0-88033-217-0 |page=313 |quote=Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Croats and Muslims in Sarajevo joined forces in an anti-Serb pogrom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports Service: Southeast Europe series |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QGtWAAAAMAAJ}} |accessdate=7 December 2013 |year=1964 |publisher=American Universities Field Staff. |page=44 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;the assassination was followed by officially encouraged anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia.

=== July Crisis ===
{{Main|July Crisis}}

The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain, called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary correctly believed that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) were involved in the plot to murder the Archduke, and wanted to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia.{{sfn |Stevenson |1996 |p=12}} On 23 July, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the [[July Crisis#Austro-Hungarian ultimatum|July Ultimatum]], a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |p=27}} Serbia decreed general mobilisation on the 25th. Serbia accepted all of the terms of the ultimatum except for article six, which demanded that Austrian delegates be allowed in Serbia for the purpose of participation in the investigation into the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, David; ''Europe's Last Summer: Why the World Went to War in 1914'', Heinemann, 2004; pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Austria broke off diplomatic relations with Serbia and, the next day, ordered a partial mobilisation. Finally, on 28 July 1914, a month after the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910. [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed]] in 1908.]]
On 29 July, Russia, in support of Serbia, declared partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{harv|Levy|Vasques|2014|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th, Russia ordered general mobilisation. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg waited until the 31st for an appropriate response, when Germany declared ''Erklärung des Kriegszustandes'', or "State of danger of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martel |first1=Gordon |title=The Month that Changed the World: July 1914 and WWI |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |location=6286 |edition=Kindle |ref=B00K79UOPK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=31 July 1914 |title=Verordnung, betreffend die Erklärung des Kriegszustandes |language=German |journal=Reichs-gesetzblatt |lccn=14013198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiser Wilhelm II asked his cousin, Tsar [[Nicolas II]], to suspend the Russian general mobilisation. When he refused, Germany issued an ultimatum demanding its mobilisation be stopped, and a commitment not to support Serbia. Another was sent to France, asking her not to support Russia if it were to come to the defence of Serbia. On 1 August, after the Russian response, Germany mobilised and declared war on Russia. This also led to the general mobilisation in Austria-Hungary on 4 August.

The German government issued demands to France that it remain neutral as they had to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being difficult if not impossible to change the deployment whilst it was underway. The modified German [[Schlieffen Plan]], ''Aufmarsch II West'', would deploy 80% of the army in the west, and ''Aufmarsch I Ost'' and ''Aufmarsch II Ost'' would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east as this was the maximum that the East Prussian railway infrastructure could carry. The French did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border to avoid any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of their reserves. Germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing ''Aufmarsch II West''.

On 1 August, Wilhelm ordered General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] to "march the whole of the ... army to the East" after being wrongly informed the British would remain neutral if France was not attacked. Moltke told the Kaiser that attempting to redeploy a million men was unthinkable, and that making it possible for the French to attack the Germans "in the rear" would prove disastrous. Yet Wilhelm insisted that the German army should not march into [[Luxembourg]] until he received a telegram sent by his cousin [[George V]], who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. Eventually the Kaiser told Moltke, "Now you can do what you want."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11002644/First-World-War-centenary-how-events-unfolded-on-August-1-1914.html The Telegraph, ''First World War centenary: how the events of 1 August 1914 unfolded'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, Sean, July 1914: Countdown to War, Basic Books, 2014, 480 p., {{ISBN|978-0465060740}}, pp. 342, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August, [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|Germany occupied Luxembourg]], and on 3 August declared war on France; on the same day, they sent the Belgian government an ultimatum demanding unimpeded right of way through any part of Belgium, which was refused. Early on the morning of 4 August, the Germans invaded; [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] ordered his military to resist and called for assistance under the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty of London]].{{sfn|Crowe |2001 |pp=4–5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dell |first=Pamela |title=A World War I Timeline (Smithsonian War Timelines Series) |year=2013 |publisher=Capstone |isbn=978-1-4765-4159-4 |pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=29}} Britain demanded Germany comply with the Treaty and respect Belgian neutrality; it declared war on Germany at 19:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on 4 August 1914 (effective from 23:00), following an "unsatisfactory reply".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror01_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=Daily Mirror Headlines: The Declaration of War, Published 4 August 1914 |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress of the war==
{{Further|Diplomatic history of World War I}}

===Opening hostilities===
====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |pp=292–296, 343–354}}&lt;!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --&gt; Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

====Serbian campaign====
{{Main|Serbian Campaign of World War I}}
[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumb|Serbian Army [[Blériot XI]] "Oluj", 1915]]

Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara]] beginning on 12 August. Over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=172}} Serbia's defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=John R. |last=Schindler |url=http://wih.sagepub.com/content/9/2/159.abstract |title=Disaster on the Drina: The Austro-Hungarian Army in Serbia, 1914 |journal=War in History |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=159–195 |date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2013|doi=10.1191/0968344502wh250oa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====German Offensive in Belgium and France====
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
[[File:German soldiers in a railroad car on the way to the front during early World War I, taken in 1914. Taken from greatwar.nl site.jpg|thumb|German soldiers in a railway [[goods wagon]] on the way to the front in 1914. Early in the war, all sides expected the conflict to be a short one.]]
[[File:Georges Scott, A la baïonnette !.jpg|thumb|French bayonet charge, [[Battle of the Frontiers]]; by the end of August, French casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.]]

When the war began, the [[German Army order of battle (1914)|German Order of Battle]] placed 80% of the army in the West, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East. The plan was to quickly knock France out of the war, then redeploy to the East and do the same to Russia.

The German offensive in the West was officially titled ''Aufmarsch I West,'' but is better known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], after its original creator. [[Alfred von Schlieffen|Schlieffen]] deliberately kept the German left (i.e. its positions in Alsace-Lorraine) weak to lure the French into attacking there, while the majority were allocated to the German right, so as to sweep through Belgium, encircle Paris and trap the French armies against the Swiss border (the French charged into Alsace-Lorraine on the outbreak of war as envisaged by their [[Plan XVII]], thus actually aiding this strategy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horne |first1=Alistair |title=The Price of Glory |date=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0140170412 |page=22 |edition=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schlieffen's successor [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Moltke]] grew concerned that the French might push too hard on his left flank. As such, as the German Army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the German right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30. Ultimately, Moltke's changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.{{sfn |Holmes |2014 |pp=194, 211}}{{Dubious|date=November 2018}}

The initial German advance in the West was very successful: by the end of August the Allied left, which included the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), was in [[Great Retreat|full retreat]]; French casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=David |title=1914–1918: The History of the First World War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0718197957 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; German planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Julian |title=A Certain Idea of France: The Life of Charles de Gaulle |date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=978-1846143519 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French and British exploited this gap to halt the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] from 5 to 12 September and push the German forces back some {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1911, the Russian [[Stavka]] had agreed with the French to attack Germany within 15 days of mobilisation; this was unrealistic and the two Russian armies that entered [[East Prussia]] on 17 August did so without many of their support elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieven |first1=Dominic |title=Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141399744 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2nd Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Second Army]] was effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] on 26–30 August but the Russian advance caused the Germans to re-route their [[8th Army (German Empire)|8th Field Army]] from France to East Prussia, a factor in Allied victory on the Marne.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=376–378}} This amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the Marne, [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]] told an American reporter; "We have lost the war. It will go on for a long time but lost it is already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horne |first1=Alistair |title=The Price of Glory |date=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0140170412 |page=221 |edition=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia and the Pacific====
{{Main|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}}
[[File:Melbourne recruiting WWI.jpg|thumb |[[Military recruitment]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], 1914]]

New Zealand [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] [[German Samoa]] (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914. On 11 September, the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. On 28 October, the German cruiser {{SMS |Emden |1908 |6}} sank the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] in the [[Battle of Penang]]. Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] on the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. As Vienna refused to withdraw the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS |Kaiserin Elisabeth}} from Tsingtao, Japan declared war not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary; the ship participated in the defence of Tsingtao where it was sunk in November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Donko, Wilhelm M. (2012). ''A Brief History of the Austrian Navy'' epubli GmbH, Berlin, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=224–232}}{{sfn |Falls |1960 |pp=79–80}}

====African campaigns====
{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}
[[File:Recruiting for the Holy War near Tiberias 1914.jpg|thumb |[[Military recruitment]] near [[Tiberias]], [[Ottoman Empire]], 1914]]

Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]] and [[Kamerun]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.{{sfn |Farwell |1989 |p=353}}

====Indian support for the Allies====
{{Further|Hindu–German Conspiracy|Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition|Third Anglo-Afghan War}}

Germany attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|instigating uprisings in India]], and [[Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition|sending a mission]] that urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers. However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards Britain.{{sfn |Brown |1994 |pp=197–198}}{{sfn |Brown |1994 |pp=201–203}} Indian political leaders from the [[Indian National Congress]] and other groups were eager to support the British war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of [[Indian Home Rule movement|Indian Home Rule]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the [[princely state]]s sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000&amp;nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm |title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War |publisher=Memorial Gates Trust |accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled [[Indian independence movement|the campaign for full independence]] that would be led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Horniman, Benjamin Guy. ''British administration and the Amritsar massacre''. Mittal Publications, 1984. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Front===
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}

====Trench warfare begins====
[[File:Cheshire Regiment trench Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|Trenches of the 11th [[Cheshire Regiment]] at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], July 1916]]

Military tactics developed before World War I failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while [[artillery]], vastly&lt;!--between HE }} hydraulic recoil mechanisms, something like two orders of magnitude--&gt; more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine gun]]s, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=424}} Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for [[Trench warfare|breaching entrenched]] positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas warfare]] and the [[Tanks in World War I|tank]].{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |pp=421–423}}

After the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the "[[Race to the Sea]]". By the end of 1914, the opposing forces were left confronting each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's coast.&lt;ref name=AJPT2/&gt; Since the Germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since Anglo-French trenches were initially intended as "temporary," preparatory to breaking the German defences.{{sfn |Goodspeed |1985 |p=199 (footnote)}}

Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (violating the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Love |1996}} Tanks were developed by Britain and France and were first used in combat by the British during the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.

====Continuation of trench warfare====
[[File:French 87th Regiment Cote 34 Verdun 1916.jpg|thumb|upright|French 87th regiment near Verdun, 1916]]

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. Strategically, while the Germans only mounted one major offensive, the Allies made several attempts to break through the German lines.

In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the [[Battle of Verdun]], lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000{{sfn |Dupuy |1993 |p=1042}} to 975,000{{sfn |Grant |2005 |p=276}} casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichfield |first=John |date=21 February 2006 |title=Verdun: myths and memories of the 'lost villages' of France |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/verdun-myths-and-memories-of-the-lost-villages-of-france-467285.html |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |[[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench, [[first day on the Somme]], 1916]]

The [[Battle of the Somme]] was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The [[first day on the Somme|opening day]] of the offensive (1 July 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the [[British Army]], suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000.{{sfn |Harris |2008 |p=271}} Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as [[trench foot]], shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties (body lice) and the ‘Spanish Flu’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://trenchwarfareworldwar1.weebly.com/living-conditions.html |title=Living conditions |website=Trench Warfare|access-date=19 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420074403/https://trenchwarfareworldwar1.weebly.com/living-conditions.html|archive-date=20 April 2018|dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=It's a self-published Weebly website|date=June 2018}}

Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916,{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1221}} combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using [[frontal assault]] came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread [[French Army Mutinies]], after the failure of the costly [[Nivelle Offensive]] of April–May 1917.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=854}} The concurrent British [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=325–326}}{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |p=244}} A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]], became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.{{sfn |Inglis |1995 |p=2}}{{sfn |Humphries |2007 |p=66}}

The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.

The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German [[Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917|tactics constantly evolved]] to meet new battlefield challenges.

At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. Before the beginning of the war, it was widely understood that Britain held the position of strongest, most influential navy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://warandsecurity.com/2014/08/04/the-naval-balance-of-power-in-1914/ |title=The Naval Balance of Power in 1914 |date=4 August 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Looks to be a [[WP:SPS|SPS]] blog post.|date=May 2018}} The publishing of the book ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'' by [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] in 1890 was intended to encourage the United States to increase their naval power. Instead, this book made it to Germany and inspired its readers to try to over-power the British Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sempa |first=Francis P. |url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/12/the-geopolitical-vision-of-alfred-thayer-mahan/ |title=The Geopolitical Vision of Alfred Thayer Mahan |publisher=The Diplomat |website=thediplomat.com |date=30 December 2014|access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the German detached light cruiser {{SMS|Emden}}, part of the [[East Asia Squadron]] stationed at Qingdao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, most of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]—consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig|1905|2}} and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships. The German flotilla and {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was virtually destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too had been destroyed or interned.{{sfn |Taylor |2007 |pp=39–47}}

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.{{sfn|Keene |2006 |p=5}} Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.{{sfn|Halpern |1995 |p=293}} Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.{{sfn|Zieger |2001 |p=50}}

The [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the [[Skagerrak]]") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. It was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], fought the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeremy Black |title=Jutland's Place in History |journal=Naval History |date=June 2016 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[U-boat]]s attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sheffield |first=Garry |title=The First Battle of the Atlantic |website=World Wars In Depth |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/battle_atlantic_ww1_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of [[submarine warfare]] meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"/&gt;{{sfn|Gilbert |2004 |p=306}} The United States launched a protest, and Germany changed its rules of engagement. After the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the "[[Prize rules|cruiser rules]]", which demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet).{{sfn |von der Porten |1969}} Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], realising that the Americans would eventually enter the war.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones |2001 |p=80}} Germany sought to strangle Allied [[sea lane]]s before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"/&gt;

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in [[Convoys in World War I|convoys]], escorted by [[destroyer]]s. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/index.php/committees/committee_hansard/C11/va_2006nov09 |title=Committee Hansard |date=9 November 2006 |author=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs |accessdate=12 March 2013 |website=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Roger |last1=Chickering |first2=Stig |last2=Förster |first3=Bernd |last3=Greiner |series=Publications of the German Historical Institute |location=Washington, DC |year=2005 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=evVPoSwqrG4C |page=73}} |title=A world at total war: global conflict and the politics of destruction, 1937–1945 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-83432-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I also saw the first use of [[aircraft carrier]]s in combat, with {{HMS |Furious |47 |6}} launching [[Sopwith Camel]]s in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern raid|Tondern]] in July 1918, as well as [[blimp]]s for antisubmarine patrol.&lt;ref name="price1980"&gt;{{harvnb |Price |1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia.&lt;ref name="TuckerRoberts2005"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Spencer |last1=Tucker |first2=Priscilla Mary |last2=Roberts |title=World War One |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2YqjfHLyyj8C |page=241}} |year= 2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-420-2 |pages=241–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria-Hungary in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy. Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.{{sfn |Neiberg |2005 |pp=54–55}}

Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 12 October 1915 and joined in the attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000 that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. The Serbs suffered defeat in the [[Kosovo Offensive (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=1075–1076}} After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=102}}

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers. However, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] before the Allied expeditionary force arrived.{{sfn |Neiberg |2005 |pp=108–110}} The friction between the King of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the [[National Schism]], which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica. After intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as [[Noemvriana]]), the King of Greece resigned and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place; Greece officially joined the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917.

The Macedonian Front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 following the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilisation of the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Richard |title=Balkan Breakthrough: The Battle of Dobro Pole 1918 |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |page=11 |isbn=978-0-253-35452-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918 in the [[Vardar Offensive]], after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]], and by 25 September British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September 1918.{{sfn |Tucker |Wood |Murphy |1999 |pp=150–152}} The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.&lt;ref name=militera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html |title=The Balkan Front of the World War |language=Russian |first=N. |last=Korsun |publisher=militera.lib.ru |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of the Macedonian Front meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.{{sfn|Doughty |2005 |p=491}}

The Ottomans threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. As the conflict progressed, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian populations, known as the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]], and [[Assyrian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gettleman |editor1-first=Marvin |editor2-last=Schaar |editor2-first=Stuart |title=The Middle East and Islamic world reader |date=2003 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8021-3936-8 |pages=119–120 |edition=4th pr. |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=srLGT3dwTogC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=January |first1=Brendan |title=Genocide : modern crimes against humanity |date=2007 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |location=Minneapolis, Minn. |isbn=978-0-7613-3421-7 |page=14 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IoPMDp2WA6cC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lieberman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=The Holocaust and Genocides in Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Continuum Publishing Corporation |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9478-7 |pages=80–81 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ySFMAQAAQBAJ}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In [[Mesopotamia]], by contrast, after the defeat of the British defenders in the [[Siege of Kut]] by the Ottomans (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian tribesmen, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and Turcoman tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J. Barker, ''The Neglected War: Mesopotamia, 1914–1918'' (London: Faber, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the [[Battle of Romani]] by the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]] and the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]. Following this victory, an [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] advanced across the [[Sinai Peninsula]], pushing Ottoman forces back in the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December and the [[Battle of Rafa]] on the border between the Egyptian [[Sinai]] and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Crawford |first2=Ian |last2=McGibbon |title=New Zealand's Great War: New Zealand, the Allies and the First World War |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mtEEuD_-2SMC |page=219}} |year=2007 |publisher=Exisle Publishing |pages=219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian armies generally had success in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.{{sfn|Fromkin |2004 |p=119}} He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter. He lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]].&lt;ref name=caven&gt;{{harvnb |Hinterhoff |1984 |pp=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]) in December 1914 in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to [[petroleum reservoir]]s around [[Baku]] near the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;a b c The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.403&lt;/ref&gt; Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence. The Ottomans and Germans were aided by [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Azeri]] forces, together with a large number of major Iranian tribes, such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Tangistani]]s, [[Luristani]]s, and [[Khamseh]], while the Russians and British had the support of [[Armenians|Armenian]] and Assyrian forces. The [[Persian Campaign]] was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;a b c d e f g (Northcote 1922, pp. 788)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarikam.jpg|thumb|Russian forest trench at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]], 1914–1915]]

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.&lt;ref name=caven/&gt; In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar abdicated in the course of the [[February Revolution]], and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

The [[Arab Revolt]], instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign Office]], started June 1916 with the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]] before surrendering in January 1919.{{sfn |Sachar |1970 |pp=122–138}}

The [[Senussi]] tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the [[Senussi Campaign]]. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.{{sfn |Gilbert |1994}}

Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men. Total Ottoman casualties were 725,000 (325,000 dead and 400,000 wounded).&lt;ref name="Brief Ottoman History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanioglu |first=M.

Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Trentino]], the [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (Rijeka) and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its part in the Triple Alliance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hall |last=Gardner |title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=631TBgAAQBAJ |page=120}} |year=2015 |publisher=Ashgate |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy secretly agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany.&lt;ref name="Seymour" /&gt; At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Southern Tyrol]], Austrian Littoral and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later, Italy declared war on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas Nelson |last=Page |title=Italy and the world war |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nQgyAQAAIAAJ |page=142}} |year=1920 |publisher=Scribners |pages=142–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Austro-Hungarian troops, Tyrol]]

The Italians had numerical superiority, but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which the fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall|page=108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening Vienna.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Thompson |title=The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915–1919 |publisher=London: Faber and Faber |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo]] (Soča) River, northeast of [[Trieste]]. Of this eleven offensives, five were won by Italy, three remained inconclusive, and other three were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the [[Battle of Doberdò]], the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the [[Banjšice Plateau|Banjšice]] and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.

[[File:Kämpfe auf dem Doberdo.JPG|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Doberdò]], fought in August 1916 between the Italian and the Austro-Hungarian armies]]

The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans, and achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] ([[Kobarid]]). The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} to reorganise, stabilising the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since the Italian Army had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Caporetto, the Italian Government ordered conscription of the so-called ''{{'}}99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99''): all males born in 1899 and prior, who were 18 years old or older. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the Piave and were finally decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October. On 1 November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in [[Pula]], preventing it from being handed over to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 3 November, the Italians invaded Trieste from the sea. On the same day, the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] was signed. By mid-November 1918, the Italian military occupied the entire former Austrian Littoral and had seized control of the portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops, 1916]]

Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. On August 4, 1916, Romania and the Entente signed the Political Treaty  and  Military  Convention, that established  the coordinates  of  Romania’s  participation  in  the  war. In return, it received the Allies' formal sanction for the annexation of the Romanian-inhabited regions of Austria-Hungary. The action had large popular support&lt;ref&gt;Laurentiu-Cristian Dumitru, Preliminaries of Romania's entering the World War I,
No. 1/2012 , Bulletin of “Carol I”  National Defence University, Bucharest, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|launched an attack]] against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove them back.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Barrett, ''Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916.

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and [[Bolshevik]] Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia, inhabited by a Romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Charles Upson (1927). Bessarabia. New York City: Dodd, Mead.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=Erdély története |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=History of Transylvania |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html |isbn=978-84-8371-020-3 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Потери народонаселения в 20. веке |language=Russian |trans-title=The loss of population in the 20th Century |last=Erlikman |first=Vadim |year=2004 |location=Moscow |publisher=Русская панорама |isbn=978-5931651071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Front===

====Initial actions====
[[File:Nastepca tronu w twierdzy przemysl.jpg|thumb|Heir presumptive Karl visiting the fortress of Przemyśl after the first siege. The Russian [[Siege of Przemyśl]] was the longest siege of the war.]]

Russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at the battles of Tannenberg and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.{{sfn |Tucker |2005 |p=715}}{{sfn |Meyer |2006 |pp=152–154, 161, 163, 175, 182}} Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership were instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated to Galicia, and, in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers with their [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Smele"&gt;{{harvnb |Smele}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August, they captured [[Warsaw]] and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.

====Russian Revolution====
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Allied troops parade through [[Vladivostok]] in armed support of the anti-communist [[White Movement#White Army|White Army]], September 1918]]

Despite Russia's success in the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] against the Austrians in eastern Galicia,{{sfn |Schindler |2003}} the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other Russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by [[Romania during World War I|Romania's entry into the war]] on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania while a German-Bulgarian force attacked from the south; [[Bucharest]] was taken by the Central Powers on 6 December and Romania knocked out of the war. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsar]] remained at the front. The increasingly incompetent rule of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neiberg |first1=Michael |title=The Cambridge History of the First World War |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=110–132 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.{{sfn |Wheeler-Bennett |1956}}{{Citation not found}} Despite this enormous German success, the manpower required by the Germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive, and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]] for the Central Powers war effort.

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the [[White movement|"Whites"]] (as opposed to the "Reds") in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn |Mawdsley |2008 |pp=54–55}} Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk]] and in [[Vladivostok]] as part of the [[North Russia Intervention]].

====Czechoslovak Legion====
{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}
[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb |left|[[Czechoslovak Legion]], Vladivostok, 1918]]

The Czechoslovak Legion fought with the Entente; its goal was to win support for the independence of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The Legion in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was established in September 1914, in December 1917 in [[French Third Republic|France]] (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Czechoslovak Legion troops defeated the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army at the Ukrainian village of [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]], in July 1917. After this success, the number of Czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as Czechoslovak military power. In the [[Battle of Bakhmach]], the Legion defeated the Germans and forced them to make a truce.

In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War, siding with the Whites against the [[Bolsheviks]], at times controlling most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and conquering all the major cities of [[Siberia]]. The presence of the Czechoslovak Legion near [[Yekaterinburg]] appears to have been one of the motivations for the Bolshevik [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execution of the Tsar and his family]] in July 1918. Legionaries arrived less than a week afterwards and captured the city. Because Russia's European ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of Vladivostok. The last transport was the American ship Heffron in September 1920.

===Central Powers peace overtures===
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|"''[[They shall not pass]]"'', a phrase typically associated with the defence of Verdun]]

On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a [[Romania during World War I#The counteroffensive of the Central Powers (September–December 1916)|successful offensive against Romania]], Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies.&lt;ref name=lanoszka&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/11/why-the-first-world-war-lasted-so-long/? |author=Alexander Lanoszka, Michael A. Hunzeker |title=Why the First War lasted so long |publisher=Washington Post |date=11 November 2018 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".&lt;ref name=lanoszka/&gt;

Soon after, the US President, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721–766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.

===1917–1918===
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

====Developments in 1917====
[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'écluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&amp;nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&amp;nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.

On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

The victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.{{sfn|Heyman |1997 |pp=146–147}}

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. Italy opposed the proposals. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.{{sfn|Kurlander |2006}}{{sfn|Shanafelt |1985 |pp=125–130}}

They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.

The reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918. In two days the British and Indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)]] at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], the continuous trench lines at [[Battle of Tabsor (1918)|Tabsor]], [[Battle of Arara|Arara]], and the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)]] headquarters at [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]]. The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry. During virtually continuous operations by [[Australian Light Horse]], British mounted Yeomanry, Indian [[Lancers]], and New Zealand [[Mounted Riflemen|Mounted Rifle]] brigades in the [[Jezreel Valley]], they captured [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]], [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah and Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]], along with [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Haifa]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Daraa]] east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway. [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]] and [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]] were captured on the way northwards to [[Damascus]]. Meanwhile, [[Third Transjordan attack|Chaytor's Force]] of Australian light horse, New Zealand mounted rifles, Indian, British West Indies and Jewish infantry captured the crossings of the [[Jordan River]], [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]], [[Amman]] and at Ziza most of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)]]. The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of [[Aleppo]].

On or shortly before 15 August 1917 [[Pope Benedict XV]] made a peace proposal&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Wednesday 15 August 1917, reprinted on p. 26 of ''Daily Telegraph'' Tuesday 15 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting:
* No annexations

* No point in ordering reparations, because so much damage had been caused to all belligerents

====Entry of the United States====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

At the outbreak of the war, the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When the German U-boat [[SM U-20 (Germany)|''U-20'']] [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sank the British liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7 May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] insisted that America is "too proud to fight" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. However, he also repeatedly warned that the United States would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced German acts as "piracy".{{sfn |Brands |1997 |p=756}} Wilson was narrowly re-elected in [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] after campaigning with the slogan "he kept us out of war".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1915/10/12/page/1/article/wilson-for-america-first "Wilson for 'America First'"], ''[[The Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' (12 October 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton.

[[File:USA bryter de diplomatiska förbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917]]

In January 1917, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.&lt;ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"&gt;{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2 April 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany"]] (Wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4 days later]].

The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |accessdate=27 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211238/http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |archivedate=7 May 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the US Congress granted US citizenship to Puerto Ricans to allow them to be drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]]. German General Staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the British and French forces before American troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=David |title=The Kaiser's Army: The German Army in World War One |date=2014 |publisher=COnway |location=London |isbn=978-1844862924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Ireland]], and [[submarine]]s to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[US Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as filler material. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, and earned a unit [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Château-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and Sechault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US [[National Archives and Records Administration]] |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I |accessdate=29 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604163502/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.{{sfn |Millett |Murray |1988 |p=143}}

Ludendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived.

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}

The front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&amp;nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}

[[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917. General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently.{{sfn|Moon |1996 |pp=495–196}}

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained storm troopers.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.

====New states enter the war====
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{sfn|Hovannisian |1967 |pp=1–39}}

====Hundred Days Offensive====
{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}
[[File:Riflemen-1918-Western-Front.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Between April and November 1918, the Allies increased their front-line rifle strength while German strength fell by half.{{sfn |Ayers |1919 |p=104}}]]

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]. The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British, [[Dominion]], and French troops, and by the end of its first day a gap {{convert|24|km|mi}} long had been created in the German lines. The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Vanwell |origyear=1977 |year=2004 |title=Shock Army of the British Empire: The Canadian Corps in the Last 100 Days of the Great War |last=Schreiber |first=Shane B. |place=St. Catharines, ON |isbn=978-1-55125-096-0 |oclc=57063659}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Rickard |2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Pan |origyear=1998 |year=1999 |title=1918: Year of Victory |last=Brown |first=Malcolm |place=London |isbn=978-0-330-37672-3 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an advance as far as {{convert|23|km|mi|0}}, German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.

Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.&lt;ref name="Pitt-1962"&gt;{{harvnb |Pitt |2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the Offensive began, Ludendorff said: "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden: "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier."&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

=====Battle of Albert=====

British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]] on 21 August.{{sfn |Terraine |1963}} The assault was widened by French&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW"&gt;{{harvnb |Gray |Argyle |1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the Allied pressure along a {{convert|110|km|mi|0|adj=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."&lt;ref name="Pitt-1962" /&gt;

Faced with these advances, on 2 September the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] issued orders to withdraw in the south to the [[Hindenburg Line]]. This ceded without a fight the [[Salient (territory)|salient]] seized the previous April.{{sfn |Nicholson |1962}} According to Ludendorff, "We had to admit the necessity&amp;nbsp;... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.{{sfn |Ludendorff |1919}} In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning on 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken. The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected.&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

====Allied advance to the Hindenburg Line====
[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|An American major, piloting an [[observation balloon]] near the front, 1918]]

In September the Allies [[Hundred Days Offensive#Advance to the Hindenburg Line|advanced to the Hindenburg Line]] in the north and centre. The Germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&amp;nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September an assault by both the British and French came within {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} of St. Quentin. The Germans had now retreated to positions along or behind the Hindenburg Line. That same day, Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

The [[Hundred Days Offensive#Battles of the Hindenburg Line|final assault]] on the Hindenburg Line began with the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], launched by French and American troops on 26 September. The following week, co-operating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.{{sfn |McLellan |p=49}} On 8 October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=For King and Empire: A Social History and Battlefield Tour |title=The Canadians at Cambrai and the Canal du Nord, August–September 1918 |publisher=CEF Books |year=1997 |last=Christie |first=Norm M. |isbn=978-1-896979-18-2 |oclc=166099767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions as it fell back towards Germany.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=380}}{{sfn |Hull |2006 |pp=307–310}}{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=383}} The Americans supplied more than 80% of Allied oil during the war, and there was no shortage.{{sfn |Painter |2012 |p=25 |ps=.

====German Revolution 1918-1919====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R72520, Kiel, Novemberrevolution, Matrosenaufstand.jpg|thumb|[[German Revolution]], Kiel, 1918]]

News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy.

In northern Germany, the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]], which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel]], spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurkuhl.de/docs/kieler_14punkte.pdf|title=K.

====New German government surrenders====
With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government on 3 October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=385}} There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic.

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm |website=League of Nations Photo Archive |title=1918 Timeline |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]].&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918"/&gt;

On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] ([[Armistice of Villa Giusti]]). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the following days the Italian Army occupied [[Innsbruck]] and all [[Tyrol]] with 20 to 22,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrea Di Michele |title=Trento, Bolzano E Innsbruck: L'occupazione Militare Italiana Del Tirolo (1918–1920) |language=it |trans-title=Trento, Bolzano and Innsbruck: The Italian Military Occupation of Tyrol (1918–1920) |journal=Trento e Trieste.

On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne. At 11&amp;nbsp;am on 11 November 1918—"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"—a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. The [[occupation of the Rhineland]] took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185–188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War, 1914–1918'' (1977) p. 153, using estimated made by H. Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1941) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}
In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian. Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]], the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]]s, and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]]. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4&amp;nbsp;million soldiers dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm "France's oldest WWI veteran dies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm |date=28 October 2016 }}, ''BBC News'', 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; not counting other casualties.

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hastedt |first=Glenn P. |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy |publisher=Infobase Publishing |series= |volume= |edition= |date=2009 |location= |page=483 |language= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-1-4381-0989-3 |mr= |zbl= |jfm=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murrin |first=John |authorlink= |last2=Johnson |first2=Paul | author2-link = |last3=McPherson |first3=James | author3-link = |last4=Gerstle |first4=Gary | author4-link = |last5=Fahs |first5=Alice | author5-link = |title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People |publisher=Cengage Learning |series= |volume=II |edition= |date=2010 |location= |page=622 |language= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-495-90383-3 |mr= |zbl= |jfm=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]] was signed on 2 July 1921 by President [[Warren G.

After the Treaty of Versailles, treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the negotiation of the treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]] was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

===Peace treaties and national boundaries===

After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.{{sfn |Magliveras |1999 |pp=8–12}}{{sfn |Northedge |1986 |pp=35–36}}

The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement was [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]]. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |first=John H. |last=Morrow |title=The Great War: An Imperial History |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-20440-8 |lastauthoramp=y |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the "[[diktat]] of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hagen |last=Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=B84ZaAdGbS4C |page=204}} |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard U.P. |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. The legend of the "[[stab in the back]]" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics.

[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in the [[Hall of Mirrors]], Versailles, 28 June 1919, by [[Sir William Orpen]]]]

Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Surrogate Hegemon in Polish Postcolonial Discourse Ewa Thompson, Rice University |url=http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ethomp/The%20Surrogate%20Hegemon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Conference required all the defeated powers to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all the damage done to civilians. However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany.

Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]], only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Károly |last1=Kocsis |first2=Eszter Kocsisné |last2=Hodosi |title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin |year=1998 |isbn=978-963-7395-84-0 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[History of Estonia#Road to the republic|Estonia]], [[History of Finland#Independence and Civil War|Finland]], [[History of Latvia#Independence|Latvia]], [[History of Lithuania#Independent Lithuania (1918–40)|Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918.{{sfn |Clark |1927}}

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, with much of its [[Levant]] territory awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core in [[Anatolia]] was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

Even though a lot of countries had already made a peace treaty, there was one exception, [[Andorra]]. Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914, but, because it had a very small population, Andorra had never sent any soldiers to the battlefield. Because of that, Andorra wasn't allowed to go to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], so the country hadn't made a peace treaty with Germany until 1958.
When Andorra made the declaration of war, it had an army of 600 part-time militarymen, commanded by two officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://everything-everywhere.com/8-facts-about-andorra/ | title=8 Facts You Might Not Have Known About Andorra| date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://halfapage.com/44-year-war-germany-andorra/ | title=The 44 year war between Germany and Andorra| date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/wars-that-were-extended-by-quirks-of-diplomacy-2015-12?IR=T/#andorra-and-the-german-empire-6 | title=9 wars that were technically ongoing due to quirks of diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/worldwarone/25-things-you-might-not-know-about-world-war-one/5546018 | title=25 things you might not know about WWI| date=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82–86}} and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies&lt;!--- surely most companies at the start of the war had more than 200-men!---&gt; were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008). Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-732-6}} p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

[[File:Austin21.jpg|thumb|A Russian armoured car, 1919]]

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in using heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm "[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]

On 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed "[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]". This gun from [[Krupp]] was able to shoot 750&amp;nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War I. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

&lt;poem&gt;Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling,

[[File:mustard gas burns.jpg|thumb |left|A Canadian soldier with [[mustard gas]] burns, c. 1917–1918]]

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Postwar pulp novels on future "gas wars" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s, weighing dozens of tons apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|"Heavy Railroad Artillery"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&amp;nbsp;kilograms (210&amp;nbsp;lb).

[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]

Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&amp;nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].

Another new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

====Areas taken in major attacks====
[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=4.0]]

On the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]] {{mdash}} the exception was [[Nivelle Offensive|Nivelle's Offensive]] in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: [[Operation Michael|Michael]], on the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Lys]], and on the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne]], which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]]; tanks played a prominent role in both of these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.

The areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|First Masurian Lakes]] driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive|Gorlice–Tarnów]], which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in [[Vardar Offensive|Macedonia]], which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]], the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.

Germany deployed [[U-boat]]s ([[submarine]]s) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).&lt;ref name="price1980"/&gt; To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sondhaus, ''The Great War at Sea: A Naval History of the First World War'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}
[[File:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|left|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]]. In April 1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Eric |last1=Lawson |first2=Jane |last2=Lawson |year=2002 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9PGHckhHiX0C}}pg=PT123 |title=The First Air Campaign: August 1914– November 1918 |publisher=Da Capo Press |p=123 |isbn= 978-0-306-81213-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.&lt;ref name="Cross 1991"&gt;{{harvnb |Cross |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with {{HMS |Furious |47 |6}} launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.{{sfn |Cross |1991 |pp=56–57}}

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,{{sfn |Winter |1983}} so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.&lt;ref name=FullCircle&gt;{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.&lt;ref name="Cross 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FullCircle/&gt;

On 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}. All German survivors were [[summarily executed]] by ''Baralong''{{'}}s crew on the orders of Lieutenant [[Godfrey Herbert]], the captain of the ship. The shooting was reported to the media by American citizens who were on board the ''Nicosia'', a British freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Paul G. (1994). A Naval History of World War I. Routledge, p. 301; {{ISBN|1-85728-498-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September, ''Baralong'' destroyed [[SM U-41 (Germany)|U-41]], which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship ''Urbino''. According to Karl Goetz, the submarine's commander, ''Baralong'' continued to fly the US flag after firing on U-41 and then rammed the lifeboat—carrying the German survivors—sinking it.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, Michael L.

===Chemical weapons in warfare===

[[File:French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German trenches in Flanders. Belgium., ca. 1900 - 1982 - NARA - 530722.tif|thumb|left|French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German trenches in Flanders]]

The first successful use of [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] as a weapon of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915).&lt;ref&gt;A German attempt in January on the Russian front failed to cause casualties.&lt;/ref&gt; Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Barry R. (28 February 1999). Future War and Counterproliferation: US Military Responses to NBC. Praeger, p. 84; {{ISBN|0-275-96278-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases]] and the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], which prohibited their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hEH7KcpN-OcC |page=34}} |title=The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir |first=Telford |last=Taylor |year=1993 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=978-0-316-83400-1 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0PYx0j3wRvAC |page=7}} |title=Cornerstones of Security: Arms Control Treaties in the Nuclear Era |first1=Thomas |last1=Graham |first2=Damien J. |last2=Lavera |date=2003 |pages=7–9 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |isbn=978-0-295-98296-0 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Sir Douglas Haig]] wrote in his diary, "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Poisonous Cloud: Chemical Warfare in the First World War |first=L.F. |last=Haber |date=20 February 1986 |pages=106–108 |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-858142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dew of Death: The Story of Lewisite, America's World War I Weapon of Mass destruction |first=Joel A. |last=Vilensky |date=20 February 1986 |pages=78–80 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=978-0-253-34612-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |first=D.

===Rape of Belgium===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential ''[[francs-tireurs]]'' ([[guerrillas]]) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at [[Leuven|Louvain]]—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.{{sfn |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 1–2, esp. p. 76}} Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatising the [[Rape of Belgium]] attracted much attention in the United States, while Berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in France in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;The claim of franc-tireurs in Belgium has been rejected: {{harvnb |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the United States, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.{{sfn |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 5–8}}{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=82–83}}

The British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service. Surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions".

About eight million men surrendered and were held in [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]], and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.{{sfn |Phillimore |Bellot |1919 |pp=4–64}} Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered ''en masse''. At the siege of Maubeuge about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the [[battle of Galicia]] Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the [[Brusilov Offensive]] about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, and at the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near [[Przasnysz]] (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5–3.5 million men as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3&amp;nbsp;million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.{{sfn |Ferguson |1999 |pp=368–369}} Germany held 2.5&amp;nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9&amp;nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just before the Armistice. The United States held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.{{sfn |Blair |2005}}{{sfn |Cook |2006 |pp=637–665}} Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died, and in Central Powers imprisonment 8% of Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profismart.ru/web/bookreader-115250-24.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130417092302/http://profismart.ru/web/bookreader-115250-24.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 April 2013 |title=Максим Оськин – Неизвестные трагедии Первой мировой Пленные Дезертиры Беженцы – стр 24 – Читаем онлайн |publisher=Profismart.ru |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.{{sfn |Speed |1990}}{{sfn |Ferguson |1999 |loc=Chapter 13}}{{sfn |Morton |1992}}

In Russia, when the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as [[forced labour]], e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the [[Allied Supreme Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ |title=ICRC in WWI: overview of activities |publisher=Icrc.org |accessdate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719030032/http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ |archivedate=19 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,768983,00.html |title=Germany: Notes |work=Time |date=1 September 1924 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern "[[embedded journalism|embedded]]" positions within the opposing land and naval forces.

==Support for and opposition to the war==

===Support===
[[File:Affiche-guerre Femmes-au-travail.jpg|thumb|Poster urging women to join the British war effort, published by the [[Young Women's Christian Association]]]]

In the Balkans, [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalists]] such as the leader, [[Ante Trumbić]], strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of [[Yugoslavs]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[Yugoslav Committee]], led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1189}} In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including [[Czechoslovak]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Transylvanian]], and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] representatives who urged the Allies to support national [[self-determination]] for the peoples residing within [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

In the Middle East, [[Arab nationalism]] soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] state. In 1916, the [[Arab Revolt]] began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=117}}

In East Africa, [[Iyasu V]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] was supporting the [[Dervish state]] who were at war with the British in the [[Somaliland Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mukhtar |first1=Mohammed |title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia |year=2003 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=iyasu+dervish#v=onepage&amp;q=iyasu%20dervish |accessdate=28 February 2017 |isbn=978-0810866041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Syburg, the German envoy in [[Addis Ababa]], said, "now the time has come for Ethiopia to regain the coast of the Red Sea driving the Italians home, to restore the Empire to its ancient size."

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{harvnb |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; But European socialists split on national lines, with the concept of [[class conflict]] held by radical socialists such as Marxists and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] being overborne by their patriotic support for the war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1069}} Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=884}}

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], who promoted [[Italian irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=335}} The [[Italian Liberal Party]], under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]], promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=219}} Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Leonida Bissolati]].{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=209}} However, the [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a [[general strike]] called [[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{harvnb |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt; Mussolini, a [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and the ''Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista'' ("Revolutionary [[Fasci]] for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the ''[[Fasci di Combattimento]]'' in 1919, the origin of fascism.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=826}} Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Mack Smith. 1997.

Once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and people like [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and their followers in Germany.

[[Benedict XV]], elected to the papacy less than three months into World War I, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. In stark contrast to his [[pope Pius X|predecessor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Church |year=1981 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |location=London |isbn=978-0-86012-091-9 |translator-first=Margit |translator-last=Resch |volume=9 |series=The Church in the industrial age |first=Roger |last=Aubert |editor=Hubert Jedin |editor2=John Dolan |page=521 |chapter=Chapter 37: The Outbreak of World War I}}&lt;/ref&gt; five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. His first encyclical, ''[[Ad beatissimi Apostolorum]]'', given 1 November 1914, was concerned with this subject. Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers. Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed [[World War I#15 August 1917: peace offer by the Pope|seven-point Peace Note]] of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who's Who&amp;nbsp;– Pope Benedict XV |publisher=firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/popebenedict.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the [[British Army]], [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the imminence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present),
&lt;blockquote&gt;that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.&lt;ref&gt;''"Merely For the Record": The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the US, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,&lt;ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"/&gt; and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pennell |first=Catriona |title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-959058-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=584}} The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halpin, Eunan, ''The Decline of the Union: British Government in Ireland, 1892–1920'', (Dublin, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; However, opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.{{sfn |Lehmann |van der Veer |1999 |p=62}} Some of them, most notably prominent peace activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]], refused both military and [[alternative service]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter, ''These Strange Criminals: An Anthology of Prison Memoirs by Conscientious Objectors to Military Service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8020-8707-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply".{{Cite quote |date=June 2017}}

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html |title=Soviet Union – Uzbeks |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In [[Milan]], in May 1917, [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.&lt;ref name="Seton_6"&gt;Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925''. London: Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian army was forced to enter [[Milan]] with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and [[Anarchism|anarchists]], who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.&lt;ref name="Seton_6"/&gt;

In September 1917, [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.{{sfn |Cockfield |1997 |pp=171–237}} In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for "bread, land, and peace".{{Cite quote |date=June 2017}} The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions. The [[German Revolution of 1918-1919]] led to the abdication of the Kaiser and German surrender.

===Conscription===
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription, [[New York City]], 5 June 1917]]

[[Conscription]] was common in most European countries. However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries. It was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Ward, "Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish conscription crisis". ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp. 107–129.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia, and the French Catholics in Canada.

====Conscription in Canada====
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1917}}
In Canada the issue produced [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|a major political crisis that permanently alienated the Francophones]]. It opened a political gap between [[French Canadian]]s, who believed their true loyalty was to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their British heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP12CH2PA3LE.html |title=The Conscription Crisis |publisher=CBC |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conscription in Australia====
{{Main|Conscription in Australia}}
In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by [[Billy Hughes]], the Prime Minister, caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]], so Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Farmers, the [[labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and the Irish Catholics successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Main, ''Conscription: the Australian debate, 1901–1970'' (1970) [http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:338722 abstract] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20150707113023/http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:338722 |date=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conscription in Britain====
{{Main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War}}
In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]]. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Chelmsford, J.E. "Clergy and Man-Power", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription lasted until mid-1919. Due to the political situation in Ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].

====United States====
{{Main|Conscription in the United States#World War I}}
In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers, ''To raise an army: The draft comes to modern America'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''People's History of the United States''. (Harper Collins, 2003): 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).

Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for "obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service". The most famous was [[Eugene Debs]], head of the [[Socialist Party of America]], who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7 January 1918.

====Austria-Hungary====
Like all of the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being "run on colonial lines" and the Slav soldiers as "disaffected". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}
The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.A.B. Zeman, ''Diplomatic History of the First World War'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Collingwood]], writing in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood ''An Autobiography'', 1939, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway, more than a century later.

===Historiography===
Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones, "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography".

[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]

Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]], and [[Le Souvenir français]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unidentified]] dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

In 1915 [[John McCrae]], a Canadian army doctor, wrote the poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War.

[[National World War I Museum and Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I.

World War I had a lasting impact on [[social memory]]. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark David |last=Sheftall |title=Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Samuel Hynes]] explained:

{{quote |A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"/&gt;}}

This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King &amp; Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though these views have been discounted as "myths",&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fussell2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are common. They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}

===Social trauma===
[[File:Cover-of-book-for-WWI-veterans-by-William-Brown-Meloney-born-1878.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1919 book for veterans, from the [[United States Department of War|US War Department]]]]

The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi–xv}}

The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].{{sfn |Roden}} For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.{{sfn |Wohl |1979}} Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=108–1086}} Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi–xv}}

===Discontent in Germany===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstoßlegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the "stab-in-the-back" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.

Communist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War I. Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624163832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II#53532.toc |archivedate=24 June 2008 |title=World War II |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=12 November 2009 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baker |first=Kevin |url=http://www.harpers.org/StabbedInTheBack.html |title=Stabbed in the Back!

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all of the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}
[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]

One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.

[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]&lt;ref&gt;10{{sup|9}} in this context&amp;nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]&lt;/ref&gt; of World War I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems £1.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}

[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (the so-called "war guilt" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&amp;pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for [[World War I reparations|reparations]], and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Marls, The Myths of Reparations, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–232&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However, "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion&amp;nbsp;...  into believing the "total sum was being maintained."&lt;ref name=Marks237&gt;Marks, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars) "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay" and "therefore&amp;nbsp;... represented the total German reparations" figure that had to be paid.&lt;ref name=Marks237/&gt;

This figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, pp.&amp;nbsp;223–234&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, the [[Great Depression]] arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;''World War One: A Short History'' By Norman Stone&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point Germany had only paid the equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. [[David A. Andelman|David Andelman]] notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the [[World War II|Second World War]], at the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Conference]] in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.{{efn|World War I officially ended when Germany paid off the final amount of reparations imposed on it by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=First World War officially ends |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8029948/First-World-War-officially-ends.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=15 March 2017 |quote=The final payment of £59.5 million, writes off the crippling debt that was the price for one world war and laid the foundations for another. |first=Allan |last=Hall |date=28 September 2010 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html |title=Why Did World War I Just End? |last1=Suddath |first1=Claire |date=4 October 2010 |work=Time |accessdate=1 July 2013 |quote=World War I ended over the weekend.

[[File:20 Largest economies pie chart.pdf|thumb|310px|20 largest economies pie  [[Chartism|chart]]{{clarify|date=May 2018}}]]
The '''world economy''' or '''global economy''' is the [[economy]] of the world, considered as the international exchange of goods and services that is expressed in monetary units of account.&lt;ref&gt;"World Economy." – Definition. American English Definition of with Pronunciation by Macmillan Dictionary. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, the two terms are distinguished: the "international" or "global economy" being measured separately and distinguished from [[country|national]] economies while the "world economy" is simply an aggregate of the separate countries' measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely. It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of [[Earth]].

It is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to [[Economics|human economic activity]] and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research or government cooperation makes establishing figures difficult. Typical examples are [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] and other [[underground economy|black market goods]], which by any standard are a part of the world economy, but for which there is by definition no legal market of any kind.

However, even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish a monetary value, economists do not typically use the current or official [[exchange rate]] to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect [[world]]wide value, for example in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government.

[[File:´World Bank, icp 2011 gdp ppp world share.png|thumb|310px|World share of GDP ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) ([[World Bank]], 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPEXT/Resources/ICP_2011.html|title=The International Comparison Program (ICP)|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rather, market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]]. This is the method used below, which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of [[purchasing power parity|real]] [[United States dollar]]s or [[euro]]s. However, the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways. It is unclear, for example, how many of the world's [[world population|7.62 billion people]] have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations.

According to Maddison, until the middle of 19th century, global output was dominated by China and India. Waves of [[Industrial Revolution]] in Western Europe and Northern America shifted the shares to the Western Hemisphere. As of 2017, the following 15 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US$2 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] by GDP in nominal or PPP terms: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|title=Gross domestic product, current prices &amp; Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) valuation of country GDP|work=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=October 2015|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
A '''world war''' is a large-scale [[war]] which affects the whole world directly or indirectly. World wars span multiple countries on multiple [[continents]] or just two countries, with battles fought in many [[theater (warfare)|theaters]]. While a variety of global conflicts have been subjectively deemed "world wars", such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Terror]], the term is widely and usually accepted only as it is retrospectively applied to two major international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: [[World War I]] (1914–1918) and [[World War II]] (1939–1945).

==Origin of the term==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cited the first known usage in the [[English language]] to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] newspaper: the ''People's Journal'' in 1848: "A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war." The term "world war" had been used in 1850 by [[Karl Marx]] and his associate, [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1887/12/15.htm|title=Introduction to Borkheim|last=Engels |first=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Class Struggles in France''. [[Rasmus B. Anderson]] in 1889 described an episode in [[Teutonic mythology]] as a “world war” (Swedish: ''världskrig''), justifying this description by a line in an [[Old Norse]] epic poem, "[[Völuspá]]: folcvig fyrst i heimi" ("The first great war in the world".)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rasmus Björn Anderson]] (translator: [[Viktor Rydberg]]), ''Teutonic Mythology'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uJRw32enFQC&amp;pg=PT237 p. 139], London: S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1889 {{OCLC|626839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann had used the term "world war" in the title of his anti-British novel, ''Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche Träume'' (''The World War: German Dreams'') in 1904, published in English as ''The Coming Conquest of England''.

In English, the term "First World War" had been used by [[Charles à Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd. Encyclopedia. Downloaded Feb. 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "World War I" was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on page 28b of its June 12, 1939 issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term "World War II" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3195322/world-war-grey-friday/ |title=Grey Friday: TIME Reports on World War II Beginning |work=TIME |date=September 11, 1939 |accessdate=20 October 2014 |quote=World War II began last week at 5:20 a. m. (Polish time) Friday, September 1, when a German bombing plane dropped a projectile on Puck, fishing village and air base in the armpit of the Hel Peninsula.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'' used the term on its front page, saying "The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m."&lt;ref&gt;"Den anden Verdenskrig udbrød i Gaar Middags Kl. 11", ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', September 4, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speculative fiction]] authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when [[Milo Hastings]] wrote his [[dystopian]] novel, ''City of Endless Night''.
Other languages have also adopted the "world war" terminology, for example; in [[French language|French]]: "world war" is translated as ''guerre mondiale'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Weltkrieg'' (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''guerra mondiale'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''guerra mundial'', in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''verdenskrig'', and in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''мировая война'' (''mirovaya voyna''.)

==First World War==
{{main|World War I}}
It occurred from 1914 to 1918 and in terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the [[Atomic Age]] and the resulting danger of [[mutually-assured destruction]]. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.

[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]], the death of over one million Armenians during the First World War.

==Second World War==
{{main|World War II}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[atomic bombs]] have been used. [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]] was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of six million [[Jews]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Institutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Third World War==
{{main article|World War III}}
Since the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers. The Third World War is generally considered a successor to the Second World War and is often suggested to become a [[nuclear war]], devastating in nature and likely much more violent than the First World War and the Second World War combined; in 1947, [[Albert Einstein]] commented that "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Alice | last = Calaprice | title = The new quotable Einstein | page = 173 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | isbn = 978-0-691-12075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7406337/ |title=The culture of Einstein|publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities and has been [[World War III in popular culture|explored in fiction]] in many countries. Concepts have ranged from purely-conventional scenarios, to limited use of nuclear weapons, to the complete destruction of the planet's surface.

Among these are former American, French, and Mexican government officials, military leaders, politicians, and authors: Despite their efforts, none of these wars are commonly deemed world wars.

Wars described by some historians as "World War Zero" include the [[Seven Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/07/01/why-the-first-world-war-wasnt-really|title=Why the first world war wasn't really|journal=The Economist|date=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the onset of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087924-world-war-zero-brought-down-mystery-civilisation-of-sea-people/|title=World War Zero brought down mystery civilisation of 'sea people'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003) involved nine nations and led to ongoing low-level warfare despite an official peace and the first democratic elections in 2006.
