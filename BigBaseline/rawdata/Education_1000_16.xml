'''21st century skills''' comprise [[higher-order thinking|skills]], [[aptitude|abilities]], and learning [[disposition|dispositions]] that have been identified as being required for [[achieved status|success]] in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, [[faculty (academic staff)|academics]], and [[government agency|governmental agencies]].  This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, [[information society|digital society]].  Many of these skills are also associated with [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], which is based on mastering skills such as [[analytic reasoning]], complex [[problem solving]], and [[teamwork]].  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.&lt;ref name="Dede"&gt;[http://sttechnology.pbworks.com/f/Dede_(2010)_Comparing%20Frameworks%20for%2021st%20Century%20Skills.pdf Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009].

During the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, [[society]] has undergone an accelerating pace of change in [[economy]] and [[technology]].  Its effects on the [[workplace]], and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the [[workforce]], have been significant in several ways.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.

The current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs.  Those in the [[Baby boomers|Baby Boom]] generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; subsequent generations are more concerned with finding [[eudaimonia|happiness]] and fulfillment in their work lives.  Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/#1cb0e4da5508 ''Job-hopping is the new normal for millennials'', Forbes Magazine, August 14, 2012].

Many of these skills are also identified as key qualities of [[progressive education]], a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century and continues in various forms to the present.

==Background==
Since the early 1980s, a variety of governmental, academic, non-profit, and corporate entities have conducted considerable research to identify key personal and academic skills and competencies they determined were needed for the current and next generation.  The identification and implementation of 21st century skills into education and workplaces began in the United States but has spread to Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[https://c21parentguide.wordpress.com C21 - A Parent's Guide to 21st century learning].

In 1981, the US Secretary of Education created the [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]] to examine the quality of education in the United States."&lt;ref name="Nation1"&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/intro.html Nation at Risk, introduction] Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission issued its report ''[[A Nation at Risk|A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform]]'' in 1983.

Until the dawn of the 21st century, education systems across the world focussed on preparing their students to accumulate content and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, schools focussed on providing literacy and numeracy skills to their students, as these skills were perceived as necessary to gain content and knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in technology and telecommunication have made information and knowledge ubiquitous and easily accessible in the 21st century. Therefore, while skills such as literacy and numeracy are still relevant and necessary, they are no longer sufficient. In order to respond to technological, demographic and socio-economic changes, education systems began to make the shift toward providing their students with a range of skills that relied not only on cognition but also on the interdependencies of cognitive, social, and emotional characteristics. &lt;ref&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Notable efforts were conducted by the US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), a national coalition called the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), the international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the American Association of College and Universities, researchers at [[MIT]] and other institutions of higher learning, and private organizations.

Additional research has found that the top skills demanded by U.S. [[Fortune 500]] companies by the year 2000 had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Cassel &amp; Kolstad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassel|first1=R.N.|last2=Kolstad|first2=R.|title=The critical job-skills requirements for the 21st century: Living and working with people|journal=Journal of Instructional Psychology|date=1998|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 [[Conference Board]] survey of some 400 employers revealed that the most important skills for new workforce entrants included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving, ahead of basic knowledge and skills, such as the reading comprehension and mathematics.  While the [[The three Rs|‘three Rs’]] were still considered foundational to new workforce entrants’ abilities, employers emphasized that applied skills like collaboration/teamwork and critical thinking were ‘very important’ to success at work."&lt;ref name="Conference Board"&gt;{{cite book|title=Are They Ready to Work?

A 2006 report from MIT researchers countered the suggestion that students acquire critical skills and competencies independently by interacting with popular culture, noting three continuing trends that suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions:"&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536086.pdf Jenkins].

*The Ethics Challenge — The breakdown of traditional forms of professional training and socialization that might prepare young people for their increasingly public roles as media makers and community participants."

According to labor economists at [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard’s Graduate School of Education]], the economic changes brought about over the past four decades by emerging technology and [[globalization]], employers’ demands for people with competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has increased greatly.&lt;ref name="Murnane &amp; Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murnane|first1=Richard J.|last2=Levy|first2=Frank|title=Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy|date=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the "foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have."&lt;ref name="Levy &amp; Murnane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Frank|last2=Murnane|first2=Richard|title=Dancing with Robots: Human Skills for Computerized Work|publisher=Third Way|url=http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], an effort sponsored by the [[National Governors Association]] (NGA) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO),   issued the [[Common Core Standards]], calling for the integration of 21st century skills into K-12 curricula across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The skills==
The skills and competencies that are generally considered "21st Century skills" are varied but share some common themes.  They are based on the premise that effective learning, or [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions.  This [[pedagogy]] involves creating, working with others, analyzing, and presenting and sharing both the learning experience and the learned knowledge or wisdom, including to peers and mentors as well as teachers.  This contrasts with more traditional learning methodology that involves learning by rote and regurgitating info/knowledge back to the teacher for a grade. The skills are geared towards students and workers to foster engagement; seeking, forging, and facilitating connections to knowledge, ideas, peers, instructors, and wider audiences; creating/producing; and presenting/publishing.  The classification or grouping has been undertaken to encourage and promote pedagogies that facilitate deeper learning through both traditional instruction as well as [[active learning]], [[project-based learning]], [[problem based learning]], and others.  A 2012 survey conducted by the [[American Management Association]] (AMA) identified three top skills necessary for their employees: [[critical thinking]], communication and collaboration.&lt;ref name="Critical Skills Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Critical Skills Survey|date=2012|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|url=http://playbook.amanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-Critical-Skills-Survey-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below are some of the more readily identifiable lists of 21st century skills.

===SCANS===
Following the release of ''A Nation at Risk'', the U.S. [[Secretary of Labor]] appointed the '''Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)''' to determine the skills needed for young people to succeed in the workplace to foster a high-performance economy.  SCANS focused on what they called "learning a living" system. In 1991, they issued their initial report, ''What Work Requires of Schools''.  The report concluded that a high-performance workplace requires workers who have key fundamental skills:  basic skills and knowledge, thinking skills to apply that knowledge, personal skills to manage and perform; and five key workplace competencies.&lt;ref name="SCANS"&gt;[http://www.academicinnovations.com/report.html SCANS report 1991].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundamental Skills'''
*Basic Skills:  ''reads, writes, performs arithmetic and mathematical operations, listens and speaks.''
*Thinking Skills:  ''thinks creatively, makes decisions, solves problems, visualizes, knows how to learn, and reasons''
*Personal Qualities:  ''displays responsibility, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, and integrity and honesty''

'''Workplace Competencies'''
*Resources:  ''identifies, organizes, plans, and allocates resources''
*Interpersonal:  ''works with others (participates as member of a team, teaches others new skills, serves clients/customers, exercises leadership, negotiates, works with diversity'')
*Information:  ''acquires and uses information (acquires and evaluates, organizes and maintains, and interprets and communicates information; uses computers to process information'')
*Systems:  ''understands complex inter-relationships (understands systems, monitors and corrects performance, improves or designs systems)''
*Technology:  ''works with a variety of technologies (selects technology, applies technology to task, maintains and troubleshoots equipment)''

===Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21)===
In 2002 the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or '''P21''') was founded as a [[non-profit]] organization by a coalition that included members of the national business community, education leaders, and policymakers:  the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), [[United States Department of Education]], [[AOL Time-Warner|AOL Time Warner Foundation]], [[Apple Computer, Inc.]], [[Cable in the Classroom]], [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]], [[Dell Computer Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], Ken Kay (President and Co-Founder), and Dins Golder-Dardis.&lt;ref name="P21history"&gt;[http://www.p21.org/about-us/our-history P21 Our History].

{{main article|Participatory culture}}
Researchers at MIT, led by [[Henry Jenkins]], Director of the Comparative Media Studies Program, in 2006 issued a white paper ("Confronting the Challenges of a Participatory Culture:  Media Education for the 21st Century"), that examined digital media and learning.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;  To address this [[Digital Divide]], they recommended an effort be made to develop the cultural competencies and social skills required to participate fully in modern society instead of merely advocating for installing computers in each classroom.&lt;ref name="Jenkins3"&gt;[http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/ New Media Literacies webpage].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; What they term [[participatory culture]] shifts this literacy from the individual level to a broader connection and involvement, with the premise that networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to new literacies.  These in turn build on traditional foundation skills and knowledge taught in school:  traditional literacy, research, technical, and critical analysis skills.

Participatory culture is defined by this study as having: low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, informal mentorship, belief that members' own contributions matter, and social connection (caring what other people think about their creations).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
Forms of participatory culture include:&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
*Affiliations — ''memberships, formal and informal, in online communities centered around various forms of media, such as message boards, metagaming, game clans, and other social media).''
*Expressions — ''producing new creative forms, such as digital sampling, [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and [[modding]], fan videomaking, fan fiction writing, [[zines]], [[mash-ups]].''
*Collaborative Problem-solving — ''working together in teams, formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia, alternative reality gaming, spoiling).''
*Circulations — ''shaping the flow of media (such as [[podcasting]], [[blogging]])''.

The skills identified were:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Play 
*Simulation 
*Appropriation
*Multitasking
*Distributed Cognition 
*Collective Intelligence
*Judgment
*Transmedia Navigation

===EnGauge 21st century skills===
In 2003 the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group issued a report entitled "enGauge® 21st Century Skills: Literacy in the Digital Age" based on two years of research.  The report called for policymakers and educators to define 21st century skills, highlight the relationship of those skills to conventional academic standards, and recognize the need for multiple assessments to measure and evaluate these skills within the context of academic standards and the current technological and global society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pict.sdsu.edu/engauge21st.pdf enGauge 21st Century Skills].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  To provide a common understanding of, and language for discussing, the needs of students, citizens, and workers in a modern digital society, the report identified four "skill clusters":
*Digital-Age Literacy
*Inventive Thinking
*Effective Communication
*High Productivity

===OECD competencies===
In 1997, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] launched the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) to monitor "the extent to which students near the end of compulsory schooling have acquired the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in society".&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/35070367.pdf ''The Definition and Selection of Key Competencies'', OECD, 2005].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 they identified three "Competency Categories:" 
*Using Tools Interactively
*Interacting in Heterogeneous Groups
*Acting Autonomously

===American Association of College and Universities===
The AAC&amp;U conducted several studies and surveys of their members.  In 2007 they recommended that graduates of higher education attain four skills - '''The Essential Learning Outcomes:'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/about/membership/surveytalkingpoints ''Talking Points: AAC&amp;U 2009 Member Survey Findings''] .  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge of Human Cultures and the Physical and Natural World
*Intellectual and Practical Skills
*Personal and Social Responsibility
*Integrative Learning

They found that skills most widely addressed in college and university goals are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015_Survey_Report2_GEtrends.pdf AAC&amp;U - ''Recent Trends in General Education Design, Learning Outcomes, and Teaching Approaches'', 2015].  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*writing
*critical thinking
*quantitative reasoning
*oral communication
*intercultural skills
*information literacy
*ethical reasoning

A 2015 survey of AAC&amp;U member institutions added the following goals:
*analytic reasoning
*research skills and projects 
*integration of learning across disciplines 
*application of learning beyond the classroom 
*civic engagement and competence

===ISTE / NETS performance standards===
The '''ISTE Educational Technology Standards''' (formerly '''[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS)''') are a set of standards published by the [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE) to leverage the use of technology in [[K-12 education]].&lt;ref&gt;NETS Project(2007). National Educational Technology Standards for Students. ISTE. {{ISBN|978-1-56484-237-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISTE"&gt;[http://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards/standards-for-students ISTE Standards for Students].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  These are sometimes intermixed with information and communication technologies (ICT) skills.  In 2007 NETS issued a series of six performance indicators (only the first four are on their website as of 2016):

*Creativity and Innovation
*Communication and Collaboration
*Research and Information Fluency
*Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Decision Making
*Digital Citizenship
*Technology Operations and Concepts

===ICT Literacy Panel digital literacy standards (2007)===
In 2007 the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) ICT Literacy Panel released its digital literacy standards:&lt;ref name="ETS"&gt;[https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/Information_and_Communication_Technology_Literacy/ictreport.pdf ''Digital Transformation - A Framework for ICT Literacy.'' International ICT Literacy Panel. 2007].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Information and Communication Technologies|Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)]] proficiencies:
*Cognitive proficiency
*Technical proficiency
*ICT proficiency

A person possessing these skills would be expected to perform these tasks for a particular set of information:  access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create/publish/present.  The emphasis is on proficiency with digital tools.&lt;ref name="ETS"/&gt;

===Dede learning styles and categories===
In 2005, Chris Dede of the Harvard Graduate School of Education developed a framework based on new digital literacies entitled&lt;br /&gt;
'''Neomillennial Learning Styles''':&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Fluency in multiple media
*Active learning based on collectively seeking, sieving, and synthesizing experiences.
*Expression through non-linear, associational webs of representations.
*Co-design by teachers and students of personalized learning experiences.

'''Dede category system'''&lt;br /&gt;
With the exponential expansion of personal access to Internet resources, including social media, information and content on the Internet has evolved from being created by website providers to individuals and communities of contributors.  The 21st century Internet centered on material created by a small number of people, [[Web 2.0]] tools (e.g. Wikipedia) foster online communication, collaboration, and creation of content by large numbers of people (individually or in groups) in online communities.&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;

In 2009, Dede created a category system for Web 2.0 tools:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt; 
*Sharing (communal bookmarking, photo/video sharing, social networking, writers’ workshops/fanfiction)
*Thinking (blogs, podcasts, online discussion fora)
*Co-Creating (wikis/collaborative file creation, mashups/collective media creation, collaborative social change communities)

===World Economic Forum===

In 2015, the World Economic Forum published a report titled ‘New Vision for Education: Unlocking the Potential of Technology’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_NewVisionforEducation_Report2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the pressing issue of the 21st-century skills gap and ways to address it through technology. In the report, they defined a set of 16 crucial proficiencies for education in the 21st century. Those skills include six “foundational literacies”, four “competencies” and six “character qualities” listed below.

'''Foundation Literacies'''
*Literacy and numeracy
*Scientific literacy
*ICT literacy
*Financial literacy
*Cultural literacy
*Civic literacy

'''Competencies'''

*Critical thinking/problem solving
*Communication
*Collaboration

'''Character Qualities'''
*Creativity 
*Initiative 
*Persistence/grit
*Adaptability
*Curiosity
*Leadership
*Social and cultural awareness

===National Research Council===

In a paper titled ‘Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.vt.us/WorkGroups/EdOp/Education%20for%20Life%20and%20Work-%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the National Research Council of National Academies, the National Research defines 21st century skills, describes how the skills relate to each other and summaries the evidence regarding 21st century skills. 

As a first step toward describing “21st century skills,” the National Research Council identified three domains of competence: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal while recognizing that the three domains while different, are intertwined in human development and learning. These three domains represent distinct facets of human thinking and build on previous efforts to identify and organize dimensions of human behaviour. The committee produced the following cluster of 21st century skills in the above mentioned 3 domains. 

'''Cognitive Competencies'''

*Cognitive processes and strategies: Critical thinking, problem solving, analysis, reasoning and argumentation, interpretation, decision-making, adaptive learning
*Knowledge: Information literacy, ICT literacy, oral and written communication, and active listening
*Creativity: Creativity and innovation

'''Intrapersonal Competencies'''

*Intellectual openness: Flexibility, adaptability, artistic and cultural appreciation, personal and social responsibility, appreciation for diversity, adaptability, continuous learning, intellectual interest and curiosity
*Work ethic/conscientiousness: Initiative, self-direction, responsibility, perseverance, grit, career orientation, ethics, integrity, citizenship
*Positive core self-evaluation: Self monitoring, self evaluation, self reinforcement, physical and psychological health

'''Interpersonal Competencies'''

*Teamwork and collaboration: Communication, collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, coordination, interpersonal skills
*Leadership: Responsibility, assertive communication, self presentation, social influence with others

==Implementation==
Multiple agencies and organizations have issued guides and recommendation for implementation of 21st century skills in a variety of [[learning environment]]s and [[learning space]]s.  These include five separate educational areas: standards, assessment, professional development, curriculum &amp; instruction, and learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/p21-stateimp_curriculuminstruction.pdf P21 implementation guide].

Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The designs of learning environments and curricula have been impacted by the initiatives and efforts to implement and support 21st century skills with a move away from the [[Factory model school|factory model school model]] and into a variety of different [[school organizational models|organizational models]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.org/home/46989.htm NEA 21st-Century Learner, summer 2011].

Collaborative learning environments have fostered flexibility in furniture and classroom layout as well as differentiated spaces, such as small seminar rooms near classrooms.  Literacy with, and access to, digital technology has impacted the design of furniture and fixed components as students and teachers use tablets, [[interactive whiteboard]]s and interactive projectors.  Classroom sizes have grown to accommodate a variety of furniture arrangements and grouping, many of which are less space-efficient than traditional configurations of desks in rows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobpearlman.org/Articles/ET%20Bob%20Pearlman%20article.pdf ''Making 21st Century Schools - Creating Learner-Centered Schoolplaces/Workplaces for a New Culture of Students at Work'', Bob Pearlman, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September–October 2009].

'''Advanced Placement German Language and Culture''' (also known as '''AP German Language and Culture''', '''AP German Language''' or '''AP German''') is a course and examination provided by the [[College Board]] through the [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]]. This course  is designed to give high school students the opportunity to receive credit in a college-level [[German language]] course. It is generally taken in the fourth year of high school German study.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-german-language-and-culture-course-overview.pdf|title=AP German Language and Culture Course Overview|last=|first=|date=December 2016|website=The College Board|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The exam ==
The AP German Language and Culture exam administered around the end of the academic year is split into two parts, a multiple choice section and a free response section, each with equal value in the overall exam score.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Test format===

== AP German Literature ==
The College Board originally offered two AP German exams, AP German Language and AP German Literature. However, in 1983, due to the persistently low number of AP German Literature exam students, the College Board dropped the Literature exam and since then only offered the AP German Language exam.

'''Academic discourse socialization''' is defined as one’s growing process to realize the [[academic discourse]] and reach the expectation of the [[academic community]].

== Academic discourse ==
“Academic discourse refers to the ways of thinking and using [[language]] which exist in the academy.” &lt;ref name="Hyland, 2009"&gt;Hyland, K. (2009). Academic socialization. New York, NY: The Tower Building.&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse is not just “language” itself; discourse is language use that represents a person’s existence in the world. Thus, what one has said and written are significant to academic community, which also shows that the institution cannot exist without academic discourse. Academic discourse does not only function as a tool to convey one’s thoughts but also influences one’s formation of [[social identity]], values, and world knowledge. The common ways to present academic discourse are through [[textbook]]s, [[Academic conference|conference]] presentations, [[dissertation]]s, [[lecture]]s, and research articles.

Students in the institution learn to display their thoughts through different types of academic discourse, such as [[classroom]] and conference presentations, assignments, and dissertations. In this way, they acquire [[social practice]] in the different [[academic field]]s, get to the heart of academic enterprise, and finally become a member of a [[social group]].

Discourse conventions in a particular academic field are shaped by the ways of thinking of community members and the values they believe in. Written works and speeches are widely accepted if they are composed and delivered in a suitable way in terms of discourse conventions. The recognition of a [[publication]] from an academic community is regarded as the accomplishment of one’s academic life and the realization of academic discourse. It is highly motivated when one’s published paper was cited or further developed by community members because it is the evidence of acceptance. In order to get a reputation of the academic community, people make some contributions through publication to receive [[wikt:compliment|compliments]].

== Popularity of academic discourse ==
From mid-1960s, the issues of academic discourse have caught [[researcher]]s’ and [[scholar]]s’ eyes and grown massively. The first reason why academic discourse has become popular is because the number of students in [[higher education]] has been dramatically increased, which also results in great [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] of students.

“This more culturally, socially and linguistically [[Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] student population means that learners bring different identities, understandings and habits of [[meaning-making]] to a more diverse range of subjects.”&lt;ref name="Hyland, 2009" /&gt; Therefore, it leads to the problem that it is more difficult for teachers to know whether students acquire the required ability of the principle or not. With the popularity of the concept of academic discourse, [[teacher]]s can clearly define students’ learning achievement through their performance on different types of academic discourse.

A second factor concerns the transformation of [[education system]]. Nowadays, schools do not solely rely on governments funding; instead, students’ fees are thought of as major income. [[University|Universities]] are more competitive because students as customers choose prestigious schools which are highly evaluated on the aspect of academic discourse, including the publication of dissertations and lectures in conferences.

The last reason, and also the most important factor affecting the development of academic discourse is the spread of English. English becomes as a [[lingua franca]] for oral and written [[communication]]. Even academic journals, as a representative type of academic discourse, are most in English. Moreover, “the global status of English has come to influence both the lives of scholars throughout the globe and the production and exchange of academic knowledge in the twenty-first century.”&lt;ref name="Hyland, 2009" /&gt; As a result, the learning of academic discourse is especially meaningful for [[second language]] learners.

Academic discourse [[socialization]] is a dynamic and complex process.&lt;ref name="White &amp; Lowenthal, 2011"&gt;White, J. W., &amp; Lowenthal, P. R. (2011). Minority College Students and Tacit "Codes of Power": Developing Academic Discourses and Identities. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/review_of_higher_education/v034/34.2.white.html] The Review of Higher Education, 34(2), 283-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Learners internalize the practice of the academic fields through the participation with more competent members of social groups. As novices in the academic principle, less proficient learners acquire the knowledge of academic discourse from the interaction with experts in the field. This kind of interaction is defined as a bidirectional process: both novice learners and experts can learn from each other.

Novice learners first enter into legitimate peripheral participation and then move to the center of the academic community. That is, beginners first acquire the conventions of academic discourse peripherally and imitate discourse activities from experienced learners or experts. After a period of time, learners can also complete academic oral presentations and academic [[essay]]s, and in the end, the publication of dissertations and participation in international conferences just as what former experts do in the academic community.

For students in the institution, they learn to display their thoughts through different types of academic discourse, such as classroom and conference presentations, assignments, and dissertations. In this way, they acquire social practice in the different academic fields, get to the heart of academic enterprise, and finally become a member of a social group, which can be seen as a process of academic discourse socialization.

A variety of '''ancient higher-learning institutions''' were developed in many cultures to provide institutional frameworks for scholarly activities. These ancient centres were sponsored and overseen by courts; by religious institutions, which sponsored [[Cathedral school#Early schools|cathedral schools]], [[monastic schools]], and [[Madrasah#Higher education|madrasas]]; by scientific institutions, such as  museums, hospitals, and observatories; and by individual scholars.

Around 335 BC, Plato's successor [[Aristotle]] founded the [[Peripatetic school]], the students of which met at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] gymnasium in Athens. The school ceased in 86 BC during the famine, siege and sacking of Athens by [[Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;336 BC: {{Harvnb|Furley|2003a|p=1141}}; 335 BC: {{Harvnb|Lynch|1997|p=311}}; 334 BC: {{Harvnb|Irwin|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[Museion]] in [[Alexandria]] (which included the [[Library of Alexandria]]) became the leading research institute for science and technology from which many Greek innovations sprang. The engineer [[Ctesibius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 285–222 BC) may have been its first head. It was suppressed and burned between AD 216 and 272, and the library was destroyed between 272 and 391.

The reputation of these Greek institutions was such that at least four central modern educational terms derive from them: the [[academy]], the [[lyceum]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and the [[museum]].

The [[Pandidakterion]] of [[Constantinople]], founded as an institution of higher learning in 425, educated graduates to take on posts of authority in the imperial service or within the Church.&lt;ref name="jeffreys"&gt;{{cite book| last = Constantinides| first = C.

If a university is defined as "an institution of higher learning" then it is preceded by several others, including the Academy that it was founded to compete with and eventually replaced. If the original meaning of the word is considered "a corporation of students" then this could be the first example of such an institution.  The [[Preslav Literary School]] and [[Ohrid Literary School]] were the two major literary schools of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].

In Western Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[bishops]] sponsored [[cathedral school]]s and [[monasteries]] sponsored [[monastic school]]s, chiefly dedicated to the education of [[clergy]]. The earliest evidence of a European episcopal school is that established in [[Visigothic]] Spain at the [[Councils of Toledo|Second Council of Toledo]] in 527.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 126-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  These early episcopal schools, with a focus on an apprenticeship in religious learning under a scholarly bishop, have been identified in Spain and in about twenty towns in Gaul during the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 282-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these episcopal schools, there were monastic schools which educated monks and nuns, as well as future bishops, at a more advanced level.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 290-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, some of them developed into autonomous universities.  A notable example is when the [[University of Paris#The original schools|University of Paris]] grew out of the schools associated with the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]], the [[Abbey of St Genevieve|Monastery of Ste. Geneviève]], and the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pedersen| first = Olaf| title = The First Universities: Studium Generale and the Origins of University Education in Europe| year = 1997| isbn = 978-0-521-59431-8| pages = 130–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The rise of universities| year = 1957| publisher = Cornell University Press| isbn = 978-0-8014-9015-6| pages = 12–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian subcontinent==
Major Buddhist monasteries (''[[mahavihara]]s''), notably those at [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]], [[Nalanda]], and [[Taxila (ancient)|Taxila]], included schools that were some of the primary institutions of higher learning in [[ancient India]].

===Pushpagiri===
[[Image:Udayagiri WIKI.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Udayagiri, Odisha]] Part of [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]]]]
The school in [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]] was established in the 3rd century AD as present [[Odisha]], India. As of 2007, the ruins of this Mahavihara had not yet been fully excavated. Consequently, much of the Mahavihara's history remains unknown. Of the three Mahavihara campuses, Lalitgiri in the district of Cuttack is the oldest. Iconographic analysis indicates that Lalitgiri had already been established during the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] period of the 2nd century BC, making it one of the oldest Buddhist establishments in the world. The Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] (Hiuen Tsang), who visited it in AD 639, as ''Puphagiri Mahavihara'',&lt;ref name="Misra1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Binayak Misra|title=Indian culture and cult of Jagannātha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvYdAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 July 2012|year=1986|publisher=Punthi Pustak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Education in Ancient India, Sixth, Varanasi: Nand Kishore &amp; Bros.&lt;/ref&gt; and survived until circa 1200 AD.

The center had eight separate compounds, ten temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, housing 10,000 students in the school’s heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors.&lt;ref name="Nalanda"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |title=Official website of Nalanda University |access-date=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100842/http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nalanda attracted pupils and scholars from Sri Lanka, Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey, who left accounts of the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Revival|url=https://www.nalandauniv.edu.in/about-nalanda/history-and-revival/|website=Nalanda University|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a modern [[Nalanda University]] was launched in nearby [[Rajgir]].

===Taxila===
[[Taxila (ancient)|Ancient Taxila]] or Takshashila, in ancient [[Gandhara]] (modern-day [[Pakistan]]), was an early Hindu and Buddhist centre of learning. According to scattered references that were only fixed a millennium later, it may have dated back to at least the fifth century BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Scharfe| first1 = Hartmut| last2 = Bronkhorst| first2 = Johannes| last3 = Spuler| first3 = Bertold| last4 = Altenmüller| first4 = Hartwig| title = Handbuch Der Orientalistik: India. Education in ancient India| year = 2002| isbn = 978-90-04-12556-8| page = 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the sixth century BC.&lt;ref name="Britannica Education"&gt;"History of Education", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Takshashila is described in some detail in later [[Jataka tales|Jātaka]] tales, written in [[Sri Lanka]] around the fifth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 1975:81&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the fifth century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with [[Chanakya]]. The famous [[treatise]] [[Arthashastra]] ([[Sanskrit]] for The knowledge of [[Economics]]) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya),&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 Kautilya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 |date=10 January 2008 }}.

Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The [[Vedas]] and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as [[archery]], [[hunting]], and [[elephant]] lore, were taught, in addition to its [[law school]], [[medical school]], and school of [[military science]].&lt;ref name=Mookerji/&gt;

=== Vikramashila ===
[[Vikramashila]] was one of the two most important centres of learning in India during the [[Pala Empire]], along with [[Nalanda]]. Vikramashila was established by King [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at Nalanda. [[Atisha]], the renowned [[Pandita (Buddhism)|pandita]], is sometimes listed as a notable [[abbot]].

Vikramashila is known to us mainly through Tibetan sources, especially the writings of [[Tāranātha]], the Tibetan monk historian of the 16th–17th centuries.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5407/ |title=Excavated Remains at Nalanda |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikramashila was one of the largest Buddhist universities, with more than one hundred teachers and about one thousand students.  It produced eminent scholars who were often invited by foreign countries to spread Buddhist learning, culture and religion. The most distinguished and eminent among all was [[Atisha]] Dipankara, a founder of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Subjects like philosophy, grammar, metaphysics, [[Indian logic]] etc. were taught here, but the most important branch of learning was [[tantrism]].

== East Asia ==
In [[China]], the ancient imperial academy known as [[Taixue]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]]. It was intermittently inherited by succeeding Chinese dynasties up until the Qing dynasty, in some of which the name was changed to [[Guozixue]] or [[Guozijian]]. [[Peking University]] (Imperial University of Peking) established in 1898 is regarded as the replacement of Taixue. By 725 AD, [[Shuyuan]] or Academies of Classical Learning were private learning institutions established during the medieval Chinese [[Tang dynasty]].  In [[Japan]], [[Daigaku-no kami|Daigakuryo]] was founded in 671 and [[Ashikaga Gakko]] was founded in the 9th century and restored in 1432. In [[Korea]], [[Gukhak|Taehak]] was founded in 372 and [[Gukhak]] was established in 682. [[Seowon]]s were private institutions established during the [[Joseon dynasty]] which combined functions of a [[Confucian shrine]] and a preparatory school. The [[Seonggyungwan]] was founded by in 1398 to offer prayers and memorials to [[Confucius]] and his disciples, and to promote the study of the [[Confucianism|Confucian canon]]. It was the successor to [[Gukjagam]] from the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (992). It was reopened as a private Western-style university in 1946.

== Ancient Persia ==
The [[Academy of Gondishapur]] was established in the 3rd century AD under the rule of [[Sassanid]] kings and continued its scholarly activities up to four centuries after Islam came to Iran. It was an important medical centre of the 6th and 7th centuries and a prominent example of higher education model in pre-Islam Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salari|first=H|title=University in Iran|url=http://www.jazirehdanesh.com/find.php?item=19.496.564.fa|work=paper|publisher=jazirehdanesh|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Platonic Academy]] in Athens was closed in 529, some of its pagan scholars went to Gundishahpur, although they returned within a year to Byzantium.

'''Bachelor of Integrated Studies''' ('''BIS''') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[bachelor's degree]] offered by several universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It allows students to design a customized and specific course of study to best suit their educational and professional objectives. Generally, this degree is sponsored by two or more [[Academic department|departments]] within the university. Schools which confer the degree include the [[University of North Texas]], [[Northern Kentucky University]], [[Utah Valley University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uvu.edu/is/ Integrated Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami University in Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://miamioh.edu/regionals/academics/departments/ics/academics/majors/integrative-studies/index.html Bachelor of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburg State University]], [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://integrative.gmu.edu/ School of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weber State University]], [[Washburn University]], [[Ferris State University]], [[Jacksonville State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsu.edu/degreelist.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Oakland University]], [[Nevada State College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312010520/http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|title=Integrated Studies - Your Degree, Your Way.|archivedate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=Nevada State College|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixie State University]], and the [[University of New Brunswick]], [[Florida Gulf Coast University]], among others. 

According to materials issued by Weber State University:&lt;blockquote&gt;The program best suits students who have developed a sense of their educational and life goals, and who are looking for ways to express those goals through a self-designed and self-directed university program. The BIS Program serves the needs of students who want to individualize or create a unique academic program; students who want to obtain a broad [[liberal education]]; and/or students who want to prepare for specific career goals and/or [[graduate school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weber.edu/BIS/program.html|title=Weber State University BIS Program|author=|date=|website=weber.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7240">'''Blended mobility''' is a term used to describe an educational concept that combines physical [[academic mobility]], [[virtual mobility]] and [[blended learning]]. It aims to promote employability of higher education students. Since 2009 is has evolved from [[virtual mobility]],&lt;ref name="vm"&gt;M. Vriens; W. Van Petegem; I. Op de Beeck; M.

The virtual mobility part of blended mobility is mostly supported through the use of information and communication technologies (e.g. [[Skype]], [[Adobe Connect]], [[Slack (software)|Slack]], [[Google Hangout]], [[Trello]]) to stay connected with the teachers and/or students who may be situated at many distant locations. The physical mobility part is typically of short-term duration, ranging from 2 to 14 days. There may exist multiple periods of short-term mobility. Short periods of physical mobility enable participants to focus for a couple of days only on the actual project, which is difficult in daily life in a local environment.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;P. Purg; K. Sirok; D. Brasil (2016)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jade.12101 
 The Transformative Impact of Blended Mobility Courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early applications of a blended mobility format can be found back in 2009.&lt;ref name="mutw"&gt;
N.F. Escudeiro; P.M. Escudeiro, [https://www.iospress.nl/book/multinational-undergraduate-team-work Multinational Undergraduate Team Work, Excellence in International Capstone Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Through this project an environment was created which encourages the development of students’ soft skills, such as teamwork and communication, in an international setting by means of an innovative instruction paradigm to improve such skills without expensive and extensive curricular changes.

The blended mobility paradigm may be executed through various formats.&lt;ref name="baim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adriart" /&gt;

Blended mobility is also seen and recognised by the [https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/[[European Commission]]] as a preparation for the long-term physical mobility or as complementing regular study programmes.&lt;ref&gt; F. Maltauro; J. Anderson, [https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/eacea-site/files/6_higher_eudcqtion.pdf Presentation: Digital within the Renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education] (visited June 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Digital Education Action Plan of the [[European Commission]] (January 2018) it is stated that blended mobility will be further promoted with new opportunities in [[Erasmus+]] to support both online and face-to-face learning and student exchange in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;
European Commission, [https://ec.europa.eu/education/sites/education/files/digital-education-action-plan.pdf Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the Digital Education Action Plan] (visited July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Blended mobility is an educational concept that combines virtual mobility through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and short-term physical mobility. 

The goal of this methodology is to obtain similar benefits as those gained with physical mobility but with less barriers.

The '''CDIO Initiative''' is an educational framework that stresses engineering fundamentals set in the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating real-world systems and products. Throughout the world, CDIO Initiative collaborators have adopted CDIO as the framework of their curricular planning and outcome-based assessment. The CDIO approach uses [[active learning]] tools, such as group projects and [[problem-based learning]], to better equip engineering students with technical knowledge as well as communication and professional skills. Additionally, the CDIO Initiative provides resources for instructors of member universities to improve their teaching abilities.&lt;ref name=queens&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.me.queensu.ca/Undergraduate/The-CDIO-Initiative.html|title=The CDIO Initiative|publisher=Queen's University - Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDIO is a trademarked initialism for '''''Conceive Design Implement Operate'''''.

==Concept==
The CDIO concept was originally conceived at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=queens/&gt; In 2000, MIT in collaboration with three Swedish universities - [[Chalmers University of Technology]], [[Linköping University]] and the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] — formally founded the CDIO Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wallenberg CDIO documents | url = http://www.cdio.org/Wallenberg_docs/wallenberg_docs.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050316045719/http://www.cdio.org/Wallenberg_docs/wallenberg_docs.html | archivedate = March 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became an international collaboration, with universities around the world adopting the same framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CDIO Collaborators | url = http://www.cdio.org/cdio-collaborators | accessdate = December 28, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120102005155/http://www.cdio.org/cdio-collaborators | archivedate = January 2, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDIO collaborators recognize that an engineering education is acquired over a long period and in a variety of institutions, and that educators in all parts of this spectrum can learn from practice elsewhere. The CDIO network therefore welcomes members in a diverse range of institutions ranging from research-led internationally acclaimed universities to local colleges dedicated to providing students with their initial grounding in engineering.

The collaborators maintain a dialogue about what works and what does not and continue to refine the project. Determining additional members of the collaboration is a selective process managed by a Council comprising original members and early adopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdio.org/participate/join-cdio-0 |title=Join CDIO|accessdate=March 29, 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325073650/http://www.cdio.org/participate/join-cdio-0 |archivedate=March 25, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

Nineteen out of twenty education regions in Texas have districts that use CSCOPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gulick |first=Joe |url=http://lubbockonline.com/education/2010-08-15/new-curriculum-system-cscope-bring-big-changes-schools-lubbock-across-state |title=New curriculum system CSCOPE to bring big changes to schools in Lubbock, across state &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of January 2, 2011 there were 747 [[school district]]s (out of 1,051 total) using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/01/02/2739194/school-districts-adopting-cscope.html |title=School districts adopting CSCOPE online curriculum &amp;#124; Mom2MomDFW.com |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

While popular with district administrators, CSCOPE has elicited mixed reactions from teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=84597 |title=Texas Teachers ~ Do you use C-Scope? - ProTeacher Community |publisher=Proteacher.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom feel excessively constrained by a set [[School timetable|timetable]] for lessons.  Other teachers, however, feel that CSCOPE is appreciated by the students and has improved classroom performance and attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Roger |url=http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927 |title=News &amp; Photos - The Llano News - Llano, Texas |publisher=The Llano News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312034723/http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927# |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that CSCOPE will better help prepare districts for the next generation of [[standardized test]]s in Texas, such as the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7874 |title=Texas Education Agency - STAAR debuts |publisher=Tea.state.tx.us |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is a product of an increased emphasis on [[accountability]] in [[State school|public education]] over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Work |first=Ann |url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2010/mar/26/local-schools-planning-for-new-cscope-curriculum/ |title=Local schools planning for new CSCOPE curriculum |publisher=Times Record News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upcoming changes==
In 2013, after complaints about parents' inability to access the curriculum as well as about lesson plans, Texas announced significant changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cypresscreek/news/sen-patrick-cscope-announce-sweeping-changes/article_dfb36eaa-7216-11e2-9245-0019bb2963f4.html |title=
Sen. Patrick, CSCOPE announce sweeping changes  |publisher=Cyprus Creek Mirror |date=Feb 8, 2013 |accessdate=Feb 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be made to the system. These changes include:

* Making all meetings of the governing board public, and meeting all the respective [[notice]] requirements.
* A joint review process of all CSCOPE lessons, beginning with [[Social studies|Social Studies]].
* Removing civil or criminal penalties associated with the release of CSCOPE content.
* Allowing teachers to post any and all CSCOPE lessons that they deem necessary.
* Creating a standing curriculum review panel composed of parents, teachers, and school administrators.

A '''course atlas''' is an online repository of credit and noncredit [[education]] courses offered by one to many educational providers across a state, region, country or around the world to facilitate course planning. [[Course (education)|Courses]] listed in the course atlas [[database]] reflect the availability of what educational providers offer the public or to their private constituents.

==Background==
The term course atlas describes an online repository containing course offerings from one or more education providers.  The course atlas thus allows one to search and find comparable courses exploring the implications of [[college transfer]], curriculum alignment initiatives, transfer evaluation methods, cross registration functions, dual enrollment strategies, study abroad programs, online registration and course planning.

Historically, [[colleges]], [[universities]], [[vocational schools]], [[adult education]] centers, [[corporate universities]] and other educational providers publish standalone course catalogs and listings in a variety of formats.  The course atlas combines the course listings from individual providers into a single, searchable and maintainable electronic repository abstracting the differences in format to make it easier to search and compare course characteristics and attributes.

A course atlas stores course attributes defining the course, such as title, description, cost, location, subject, cross reference course id, method of instruction, length of instruction, text books, faculty level, meeting times, pre-requisites, co-requisites, number of credits to be awarded, grading method, comparable courses linked by [[course equivalency]], and other descriptive elements. Additionally, the course atlas can attach learning objectives, syllabi, and learning outcomes to each course record.

The first national online course repository in the United States was the National Course Atlas,&lt;ref name="nationalcourseatlas"&gt;[http://www.courseatlas.com''National Course Atlas'', is a searchable course repository and website]&lt;/ref&gt; published by AcademyOne and used by State education agencies and education providers. The National Course Atlas is loaded and synchronized with current course offerings of higher education institutions providing keyword search of 3.5 million courses covering 10,000 subjects. Some of the statewide projects using the National Course Atlas include Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name="PA Trac"&gt;[http://www.patrac.org''Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Portal'', launched in 2007, is a searchable course repository and website]&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina,&lt;ref name="SC Trac"&gt;[http://www.sctrac.org''South Carolina's Transfer and Articulation Portal'', launched in 2008, is a searchable course repository and website]&lt;/ref&gt; Texas&lt;ref name="Grad TX"&gt;[http://www.gradtx.org''Texas Bachelor Degree Completion Program'', launched in 2011, is a searchable course repository and website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Utah. The Province of Ontario, Canada has undertaken developing and launching a course atlas to power ONTransfer - Ontario's Council on  Articulation and Transfer Portal including all higher education institutional courses in 2012.&lt;ref name="ONTransfer"&gt;[http://ontransfer.ca''Ontario's Transfer and Articulation Portal'', is a searchable course repository and website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education institutions, school districts and other education related organizations assessing formal or sponsored learning reference online course repositories supporting their efforts to search, compare and link course offerings from one another.  The National Course Atlas was one of the first examples of an aggregated course repository established in the United States used to support [[college transfer]], course planning, curriculum alignment and course equivalency management - functions that span [[education]] providers.

'''Critical consciousness''', '''conscientization''', or '''{{lang|pt|[[w:pt:conscientização|conscientização]]}}''' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], is a popular education and social concept developed by Brazilian [[pedagogue]] and [[educational theory|educational theorist]] [[Paulo Freire]], grounded in [[post-Marxist]] [[critical theory]]. Critical consciousness focuses on achieving an in-depth understanding of the world, allowing for the perception and exposure of social and political contradictions. Critical consciousness also includes taking action against the oppressive elements in one's life that are illuminated by that understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mustakova-Possardt, M (2003) [http://onecountry.org/e152/e15216as_Review_Consciousness_story.htm "Is there a roadmap to critical consciousness? Critical Consciousness: A Study of Morality in Global, Historical Context."] ''One Country. 15''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage==
The [[English language|English]] term "conscientization" is a translation of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term {{lang|pt|conscientização}}, which is also translated as "[[consciousness raising]]" and "critical consciousness". The term was popularized by [[Brazil]]ian educator, activist, and theorist [[Paulo Freire]] in his 1970 work ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. Freire was teaching the poor and illiterate members of Brazilian society to read at a time when literacy was a requirement for [[suffrage]] and dictators ruled many [[South America]]n countries. The term originally derives from [[Frantz Fanon]]'s coinage of a French term, {{lang|fr|conscienciser}}, in his 1952 book, ''Black Skins, White Masks''.

==Overview==
Paulo Freire defines critical consciousness as the ability to "intervene in reality in order to change it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critical consciousness proceeds through the identification of "generative themes", which Freire identifies as "iconic representations that have a powerful emotional impact in the daily lives of learners." In this way, individual consciousness helps end the "[[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|culture of silence]]" in which the socially dispossessed internalize the negative images of themselves created and propagated by the oppressor in situations of extreme poverty. Liberating learners from this [[mimicry]] of the powerful, and the fratricidal violence that results therefrom is a major goal of critical consciousness. Critical consciousness is a fundamental aspect of Freire's concept of [[popular education]].

[[Arlene Goldbard]], an author on the subject of community cultural development finds the concept of conscientization to be a foundation of community cultural development.  From the glossary of Goldbard's 2006 book [[New Village Press|''New Creative Community.'']]: "Conscientization is an ongoing process by which a learner moves toward critical consciousness. This process is the heart of liberatory education. It differs from "consciousness raising" in that the latter may involve transmission of preselected knowledge. Conscientization means engaging in [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], in which one both reflects and takes action on their social reality to break through prevailing mythologies and reach new levels of awareness—in particular, awareness of [[oppression]], being an "object" of others’ will rather than a self-determining "subject." The process of conscientization involves identifying contradictions in experience through dialogue and becoming part of the process of changing the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvillagepress.net/pub_newCreativeComm.html Creative Communication] ''New Village Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History of application==
The ancient [[Greeks]] first identified the essence of critical consciousness when philosophers encouraged their students to develop an "impulse and willingness to stand back from humanity and nature... [and] to make them objects of thought and criticism, and to search for their meaning and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Thorton, B. "Critical Consciousness and Liberal Education" in Watson, B. (2006) ''Civic Education And Culture.''&lt;/ref&gt; In his books ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970) ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed.'' New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Education for Critical Consciousness'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Freire, P. (2005) ''Education for Critical Consciousness.'' New York: Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Freire explains critical consciousness as a sociopolitical educative tool that engages learners in questioning the nature of their historical and social situation, which Freire addressed as "reading the world". The goal of critical consciousness, according to Freire, should be acting as subjects in the creation of democratic society. In [[education]], Freire implies [[intergenerational equity]] between students and teachers in which both learn, both question, both reflect and both participate in [[meaning-making]]. Using this idea, and describing current instructional methods as [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the Sudbury model of democratic education schools, an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury model#Individual_freedom.2C_freedom_of_choice.2C_learning_and_learning_through_experience|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[Sudbury model#Discipline|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Criticism_of_the_concept_of_teaching_literacy|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a previously imposed chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992). ''"Special Education" -- A noble Cause Sacrificed to Standardization, ''Education in America -- A View from Sudbury Valley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992). ''"Special Education" -- A Noble Cause Run Amok,'' Education in America -- A View from Sudbury Valley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987). Chapter 1, ''And 'Rithmetic,'' Free at Last -- The Sudbury Valley School,.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. The staff are minor actors, the "teacher" is an adviser and helps just when asked.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987), Chapter 19, ''Learning,'' Free at Last -- The Sudbury Valley School.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, H. (1987). [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#03 ''The Art of Doing Nothing,''] The Sudbury Valley School Experience. Accessed November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model of democratic education]] schools maintain that [[values]], [[social justice]], critical consciousness, intergenerational equity, and political consciousness included, must be [[Experiential learning|learned through experience]],&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992).'' 'Ethics' is a Course Taught By Life Experience,'' Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987). ''Teaching Justice Through Experience,'' The Sudbury Valley School Experience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987). Chapter 35, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 ''With Liberty and Justice for All''], Free at Last -- The Sudbury Valley School. Accessed November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992). ''Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned,'' Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley.&lt;/ref&gt; as Aristotle said: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them."&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, W.F. and Porter, R. (eds) (2005). ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations.'' Oxford University Press. 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up on Freire's definition of critical consciousness, [[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has expanded the definition of the concept in his work on postformalism. In Kincheloe's formulation postformalism connects cognition to critical theoretical questions of power and social justice. In this context Kincheloe constructs a critical theory of cognition that explores questions of meaning, emancipation vis-a-vis ideological inscription, and a particular focus on the socio-political construction of the self. With these concerns in mind Kincheloe's postformal critical consciousness engages questions of purpose, issues of human dignity, freedom, authority, reconceptualized notions of reason, intellectual quality, and social responsibility. Postformal critical consciousness stimulates a conversation between critical pedagogy and a wide range of social, cultural, political economic, psychological, and philosophical concerns. Kincheloe employs this "multilogical conversation" to shape new modes of self-awareness, more effective forms of social, political, and pedagogical action, and an elastic model of an evolving critical consciousness (Kincheloe and Steinberg, 1993; Kincheloe, 1999; Thomas and Kincheloe, 2006).

Freire's development of critical consciousness has been expanded upon in several academic disciplines and common applications.&lt;ref&gt;Adelson, L (1987) "Contemporary Critical Consciousness: Peter Sloterdijk, Oskar Negt/Alexander Kluge, and the 'New Subjectivity'." ''German Studies Review. 10''(1); pp. 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Public health community collaborations focused on HIV prevention for women,&lt;ref&gt;Champeau, D. &amp; Shaw, S. (2002) "Power, empowerment, and critical consciousness in community collaboration: Lessons from an advisory panel for an HIV awareness media campaign for women." ''Women Health. 36''(3):31-50.&lt;/ref&gt; the role of critical consciousness in adult education,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Tisdell, E. &amp; Stone Hanley, M. (2000) ''The Role of Positionality in Teaching for Critical Consciousness: Implications for Adult Education.'' Paper presented at the 2000 Adult Education Research Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of peer pressure on cigarette smokers&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, A., Stewart, A., Pomerleau, C. &amp; Boyd, C. (2005) "Resisting Gendered Smoking Pressures: Critical Consciousness as a Correlate of Women's Smoking Status," ''Behavioral Science. 53''(3-4); 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Freire's notion of critical consciousness is, in part, a type of [[political consciousness]].

A '''critical lens essay''' is a type of analytical [[essay]] that focuses on a [[quotation]] from a piece of literature. The essay states whether the quotation is valid, and explains why using [[literary device]]s. It is an analysis of the quote and uses literary elements and techniques to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What Is a Critical Lens Essay? | url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-critical-lens-essay.htm | accessdate=2014-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ETS Europe''' is the [[Europe]]an arm of [[Educational Testing Service]], an American company, involved in scholastic assessment in Europe.

==History==
It is headquartered in [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]. ETS employs about 2,700 individuals, including 240 with [[doctorate]]s and an additional 350 others with "higher degrees." Work that ETS does that is not associated with its nonprofit educational research mission is conducted by for-profit subsidiaries, such as [[Prometric]], which administers test by computer for licensing and certification in the professional world, and [[ETS Global BV]], which contains much of the international operations of the company.

About 25% of the work carried out by ETS is contracted by the private, [[not-for-profit]] firm, the [[College Board]]. The most popular of the College Board's tests is the [[SAT]], taken by more than 3 million students annually. ETS also develops and administers The College Board's [[Advanced Placement]] program, which is widely used in US high schools for advanced course credit.

==England and Wales Controversy==
In England and [[Wales]] ETS Europe were contracted to operate the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] assessments on behalf of the government. ETS took over this role from [[Edexcel]] in 2008. The first year of their operation was struck by a number of problems, including the late arrival of scripts to examiners, a database of student entries being unavailable, and countrywide reports of problems with the marking of the papers. The opposition Conservative party has criticised the awarding of the contracts to ETS, and produced a dossier listing previous problems with ETS' service. Their contract with the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency|QCA]] was terminated in August 2008: ETS is to pay back £19.5m and cancel invoices worth £4.6m. The UK government asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an inquiry into the failure of the 2008 tests. The report included in its main findings:
*Primary responsibility for this summer's delivery failure rests with ETS Global BV, which won the public contract to deliver the tests
*ETS's capacity to deliver the contract proved to be insufficient. A lack of comprehensive planning and testing by ETS of its systems and processes was a key factor in the delivery failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229092/0062.pdf |title=The Sutherland Inquiry |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primary schools on most of the inhabited islands. Secondary schools are located on some of the islands with students travelling to live at their school. For example, [[Abaiang]], which is in the northern [[Gilbert Islands]],&lt;ref name="A2012"&gt;{{cite web| last =  | first = | work= Office of Te  Beretitent - Republic of Kiribati Island Report Series|title= 4.

A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph’s College in [[Tabwiroa]] and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in [[Morikao]], making 370 secondary school students in total.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt; The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt;

St. Joseph's College was founded in 1939. Its alumni include both current President [[Anote Tong]], and previous incumbent [[Teburoro Tito]].

There are primary schools and secondary schools operated by the Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (such as St. Joseph's College) and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], (such as Moroni High School in [[South Tarawa]], of which [[Waitea Abiuta]] has been the headmaster).

Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend [[University of the South Pacific]], and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172788770.html Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba], Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of the South Pacific has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.

==Schools==
[[Kiribati Ministry of Education]] is the education ministry. Kiribati has 94 elementary schools, 24 junior high schools, and 16 senior high schools. The government high schools are [[King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School]], [[Tabiteuea North Senior Secondary School]], and [[Melaengi Tabai Secondary School]];&lt;ref name=Langtrainer&gt;"[https://vsa.org.nz/assets/Volunteer/ADSW8/41041-KIR-Eng-Language-Trainer.pdf VSA Assignment Description Assignment title English Language Trainer (of Trainers/ Teachers) Country Kiribati]."

==History==
Before foreign influence, education in [[Micronesia]] was rarely distinguished from everyday life experiences and learning opportunities. Spanish influence during the 17th century changed the Micronesian learning experience to what happened at schools. This system was also influenced by German influence starting in 1899. The Japanese brought their strict model of education to [[Micronesia]] in 1914. Following [[World War II]], the United States brought their own model of education to Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Ballendorf 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ballendorf |first1=Dirk Anthony |authorlink=Dirk Ballendorf |title=Coming Full Circle: A New School for Micronesia |journal=British Journal of Educational Technology |date=May 1974 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.1974.tb00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10103">'''Education policy''' consists of the principles and government policies in the educational sphere as well as the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation of [[education]] systems.

Or simply we can say that An Education Policy is a past or up to date statement or series of statements which explain, recommend or exclude a course of action or actions to be taken to run the system of education. These statements are usually written, but they could be oral. 

Education occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions.  Examples include [[early childhood education]], [[kindergarten]] through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.

Examples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school [[privatization]], tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.

Issues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with eating disorders (2nd ed). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.  It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines.  Important researchers are affiliated with departments of [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy.  Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such [[academic journal]]s as ''[[Education Policy Analysis Archives]]'' and in university policy centers such as the [[National Education Policy Center]] housed at the University of Colorado Boulder [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

== Education reform in the United States ==

[[Education reform]] is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States.  Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools.  US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins, C. (2017). ''How to be heard: 10 lessons teachers need to advocate for their students and profession''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4c281704-1acd-4d75-a285-cc3161b5fac8%2540sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4208|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform.  Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools.  These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

== Teacher policy ==
Teacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/technical-notes/teacher-policies/|title=Teacher policies: Preparation, Recruitment and Retention of Quality Teachers/Educators|last=UNESCO|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235272e.pdf|title=Teacher policy development guide: summary|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=14, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nine key dimensions ===
Nine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Teacher Recruitment and Retention ====
An effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/27/why-its-a-big-problem-that-so-many-teachers-quit-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=Analysis {{!}} Why it’s a big problem that so many teachers quit — and what to do about it|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=2017-11-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This development is a threat to the “academic and economic welfare of students.” It affects learning and drain taxpayers’ money&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/high-teacher-turnover-hurting-students-study-finds|title=High Teacher Turnover Hurting Students, Study Finds|last=Center|first=Foundation|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/solving-teacher-shortage-brief|title=Solving the Teacher Shortage How to Attract and Retain Excellent Educators|website=Learning Policy Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/topschooljobs/k-12_talent_manager/2015/02/balanced_recruitment_retention.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=7 Steps for a Balanced Recruitment AND Retention Strategy|last=Douglas|first=Emily|website=Education Week - K-12 Talent Manager|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==== Teacher Education (Initial and Continuing) ====
Teachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/21047328.html|title=“Continuing education must be in-depth”|work=@GI_weltweit|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evolllution.com/opinions/the-value-of-workshops-and-continuing-education-for-teachers/|title=The Value of Workshops and Continuing Education for Teachers|date=2012-08-10|work=The EvoLLLution|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/conted.html|title=Teachers' Continuing Professional Development at the University of Washington|website=faculty.washington.edu|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55705">'''Enactivism''' argues that [[cognition]] arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting [[organism]] and its environment.&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt; "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about [[free will]] remains a topic of active debate.&lt;ref name=Manetti/&gt;

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt; The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  [[Francisco Varela]], [[Evan Thompson]], and [[Eleanor Rosch]],&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt; who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt; This was further developed by Thompson and others,&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt;

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",&lt;ref name=ClarkA/&gt; but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.&lt;ref name="Jaegher1"/&gt; "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=Rohde/&gt;

Enactivism is closely related to [[situated cognition]] and [[embodied cognition]], and is presented as an alternative to [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Cartesian dualism]].

==Philosophical aspects&lt;!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.&lt;ref name=EThompson/&gt; The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.&lt;ref name=Burman/&gt;
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."&lt;ref name=Hutchins/&gt;

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana &amp; Varela proposed the term ''enactive''&lt;ref name=Maturana/&gt; "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism&lt;ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/&gt; or connectionism.&lt;ref group=Note name=Connectionism/&gt; They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of [[representationalism]] and [[solipsism]]. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&amp;nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the [[hard problem of consciousness]], referred to by Thompson as part of the ''[[explanatory gap]]'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.&lt;ref name=EThompson2/&gt;  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".&lt;ref name=EThompson3/&gt; Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as exemplified by [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&amp;nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."&lt;ref name=EThompson4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin [[representationalism]] with [[phenomenalism]], that is, as adopting a [[constructivist epistemology]], an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.&lt;ref name=Mutelesi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiari/&gt; However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.&lt;ref name=Glaserfeld/&gt; Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt;

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld]] expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt; It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',&lt;ref name=Ward2/&gt; that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."&lt;ref name=Diettrich/&gt; The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an [[Introduction to evolution|evolutionary]] emphasis,&lt;ref name=Diettrich2/&gt; is [[evolutionary epistemology]]. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to [[universal Darwinism]], and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Donald T. Campbell]], [[Peter Munz]], and [[Gary Cziko]].&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt; According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt;

===Enactive views of perception===
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."&lt;ref name=McGann2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alva Noë]] in advocating an enactive view of perception&lt;ref name=Noe&gt;
{{cite book |author=Alva Noë |title= Action in Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFKvU2hPhxEC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 1: The enactive approach to perception: An introduction |isbn=9780262140881 |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt; Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, [[Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis]]. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt;

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Hutto]]: "Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free."&lt;ref name="Hutto2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hutto calls this position 'REC' (&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;adical &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nactive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ognition): "According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible."&lt;ref name="Hutto2" /&gt;

===Participatory sense-making===

[[Hanne De Jaegher]] and [[Ezequiel Di Paolo]] (2007)&lt;ref name="DeJaeger0"/&gt; have extended the enactive concept of sense-making&lt;ref name="EThompson3"/&gt; into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.&lt;ref name=DeJaegher_etal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467}}
&lt;/ref&gt; De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).&lt;ref name="DeJaegher1"/&gt; It has been applied to research in [[social neuroscience]]''&lt;ref name="DiPaolo3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchilbachTimmermans&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".&lt;ref name=STorrance&gt;
{{cite journal |title=An Inter-Enactive Approach to Agency: Participatory Sense-Making, Dynamics, and Sociality |author1=Steve Torrance |author2=Tom Froese |url=http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdf/froese_humana_2011.pdf |journal=Human Mente |volume=15 |pages=21–53 |year=2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:&lt;ref name=STorrance/&gt;
:1. to be a biologically autonomous ([[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]]) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."&lt;ref name=FuchsT&gt;

In [[cultural psychology]], enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=Verheggen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 8: Enactivism |author1=Cor Baerveldt |author2=Theo Verheggen |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WljI1r2e-SUC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=165''ff'' |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.013.0009 |isbn=9780195396430 |date=May 2012 |quote= Whereas the enactive approach in general has focused on sense-making as an embodied and situated activity, enactive cultural psychology emphasizes the expressive and dynamically enacted nature of cultural meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that "It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities." They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, "the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.&lt;ref name=Baerveldt&gt;

==Artificial intelligence aspects==
{{importance section|date=May 2014}}
{{main|Enactive interfaces}}
The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in [[Cognitive robotics|robotics]] and [[Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces]]. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,&lt;ref name=Sandini&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=The ''iCub'' cognitive humanoid robot: An open-system research platform for enactive cognition |author1=Giulio Sandini |author2=Giorgio Metta |author3=David Vernon |title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Essays Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence |editor1=Max Lungarella |editor2=Fumiya Iida |editor3=Josh Bongard |editor4=Rolf Pfeifer |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn= 9783540772958}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni&gt;
{{cite book |title=Emotional Engineering: Service Development |chapter=§4.5.2 Design tools based upon enactive interfaces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow-UFDj15rUC&amp;pg=PA78 |pages=78 ''ff'' |isbn=9781849964234 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |author=Monica Bordegoni |editor=Shuichi Fukuda}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas it is common to refer to [[affordance]]s as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of Everyday Things |edition=Revised and expanded |quote=An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVQPAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 |year=2013 |page=11 |isbn=978-0465050659 |publisher=Basic Books |author=Don Norman |chapter=Affordances }}

The activity in the AI community also has influenced enactivism as whole. Referring extensively to modeling techniques for [[evolutionary robotics]] by Beer,&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, "an operational, empirically observable phenomenon."&lt;ref name=McGann3&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |author3=Ezequiel Di Paolo |year= 2013 |title=Enaction and psychology |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/4993021/Enaction_and_Psychology |doi= 10.1037/a0032935 |quote=Such modeling techniques allow us to explore the parameter space of coupling between agent and environment...to the point that their basic principles (the universals, if such there are, of enactive psychology) can be brought clearly into view.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

'''Experiential education''' is a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the [[learning environment]] and content.&lt;ref&gt;Itin, C. M. (1999). Reasserting the Philosophy of Experiential Education as a Vehicle for Change in the 21st Century. The Journal of Experiential Education,.22(2), 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not interchangeable with [[experiential learning]]; however experiential learning is a sub-field and operates under the methodologies of experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Breuning, M., &amp; O'Connell, T. (2008, Spring/Summer). An overview of Outdoor Experiential Education. Taproot, 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Experiential Education]] regards experiential education as "a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities".&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aee.org/about/whatIsEE/ "What is Experiential Education?"], Association for Experiential Education,  Retrieved 8/7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential education is the term for the philosophy and [[educational progressivism]] is the movement which it informed.

==About==
[[John Dewey]] was the most famous proponent of experiential education, writing ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938).  It expressed his ideas about curriculum theory in the context of historical debates about school organization and the need to have experience as central in the educational process; hence, experiential education is referred to as a philosophy. Dewey's fame during that period rested on relentlessly critiquing public education and pointing out that the [[authoritarian]], strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students' experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/ExperientialDewey.html Neil, J. (2005) "John Dewey, the Modern Father of Experiential Education"], Wilderdom.com. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's work influenced dozens of other prominent experiential models and advocates in the later 20th century, including [[Foxfire Fund|Foxfire]],&lt;ref&gt;Starnes, B.A. (1999) [http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-3/foxfire.htm "The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning: John Dewey, Experiential Learning, and the Core Practices."] ERIC Digests - ED426826. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Giles, D.E., Jr., &amp; Eyler, J. (1994). [http://www.umich.edu/%7Emjcsl/volumes/vol1abstracts.html#vol1-9 "Theoretical roots of service learning in John Dewey: Toward a theory of service learning."] ''Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning'', Fall, 77-85. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Outward Bound]],&lt;ref&gt;Gass, M. (2003) "Kurt Hahn address 2002 AEE International Conference", ''Journal of Experiential Education.'' 25 (3), pp. 363-371&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paulo Freire]]. Freire is often cited in works on experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, A. (1989) "Peace Studies as Experiential Education," ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]. 504.'', pp. 48–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on the participation by students in experience and [[radical democracy]], and the creation of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]'' among learners.

John Dewey was an educator, but he was foremost a philosopher. His interests included political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, logic, and [[philosophy of education]].  [[Political philosophy]] was one of his many philosophical interests.  He saw weaknesses in both the traditional and progressive styles of education. He explains in length his criticisms of both forms of education in his book, ''Experience &amp; Education'' (1938). In essence, he did not believe that they met the goals of education, which he defined as obtaining freedom of thought. Dewey did not believe in freedom of thought in any kind of absolute sense.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Dewey advocated that education be based upon the quality of experience. For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that the experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. Interaction is when the experience meets the internal needs or goals of a person. Dewey also categorizes experiences as possibly being mis-educative and non-educative. A mis-educative experience is one that stops or distorts growth for future experiences. A non-educative experience is one in which a person has not done any reflection and so has obtained nothing for mental growth that is lasting (''Experience &amp; Education,'' Dewey).

In addition to the notions raised by Dewey, recent research has shown that experiential learning does not replace traditional methods of learning but supplements it in the form of [[laboratory]] and clinical learning to offer additional skills, perspectives, and understanding of relationships. Instead, experiential learning is designed to improve one's understanding by giving one the freedom to explore and find the learning path that is most suitable for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Forecasting%20the%20Air%20Travel%20Market.pdf | title = Designing and using experiential exercises | author = [[J. Scott Armstrong]]| journal = Experiential Learning in Marketing Education | pages = 8–17 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

The methodologies reflected in experiential education have evolved since the time of Hahn and Dewey. For experiential education to become efficient pedagogy, physical experience must be combined with reflection.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"&gt;Howden, E. (2012) "Outdoor Experiential Education: Learning Through the Body," New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education. 134, pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding reflective practice, allows for personal introspection of challenges and key learnings. That is, physical challenges provide a gateway in which we can observe qualities about ourselves, and those whom we are working with. Further, for the efficacy of experiential education, experiences must be separated, giving the learner sufficient time to process the information.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"/&gt;

Experiential education informs many educational practices underway in [[school]]s ([[formal education]]) and out-of-school ([[informal education]]) programs. Many [[teaching methods]] rely on experiential education to provide context and frameworks for learning through action and reflection while others at higher levels (university and professional education) focus on field skills and modeling.

*[[Outdoor education]] uses organized learning activities that occur in the outdoors, and uses environmental experiences as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976). ''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''.  Denver, CO: [[Colorado Outward Bound School]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Service learning]] is a combination of [[community service]] with stated learning goals, relying on experience as the foundation for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Furco, A. (1996) ''Expanding Boundaries: Serving and Learning,'' Florida Campus Compact.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cooperative learning]] alters [[homogeneous]] groupings in order to support diverse [[learning styles]] and needs within a group.&lt;ref&gt;McInnerney J., &amp; Roberts, T.S. (2005). "Collaborative and Cooperative Learning," In ''The Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Volume 1: Online Learning and Technologies.'' Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing, pp. 269–276.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Active learning]], a term popular in US education circles in the 1980s, encourages learners to take responsibility for their learning, requiring their experience in education to inform their process of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bonwell, C. and Eison, J. (1991) ''Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.'' Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental education]] is based in educating learners about relationships within the natural environment and how those relationships are interdependent. Students participate in outdoor activities as part of their learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J.A. (1998) ''Environmental Education in the 21st Century: Theory, Practice, Progress, and Promise.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vocational education]] involves training for an occupation.
*[[Sandwich degree|Sandwich degrees]] involve a year working in industry during academic study.

Experiential education serves as an umbrella for linking many diverse practices into a coherent whole.  Its philosophy is closely linked to numerous other educational theories, but it should not be conflated with [[progressive education]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[youth empowerment]], feminist-based education, and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. The development of experiential education as a philosophy has been intertwined with the development of these other educational theories; their contrasts have clarified differences.

Fellowships and other training programs are available for experiential educators; but, formal training in experiential methods is lacking for K-12 undergraduate teaching programs (see Wendel, A. and Mantil, A., (2008) and the [http://www.nsee.org/ National Society for Experiential Education]).

== Examples ==
Examples of experiential education can be found in various disciplines. The educator [[Lucy Calkins]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we asked our students for the highlight of their school careers, most would choose a time when they dedicated themselves to an endeavor of great importance...I am thinking of youngsters from P.S. 321, who have launched a save-the-tree campaign to prevent the oaks outside their school from being cut down. I am thinking of children who write the school newspaper, act in the school play, organize the playground building committee.... On projects such as these, youngsters will work before school, after school, during lunch. Our youngsters want to work hard on endeavors they deem significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Living Between the Lines |last1=Calkins |first1=Lucy McCormick |last2=Harwayne |first2=Shelley |publisher=Heinemann |year=1991 |isbn=0435085387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing [[Diary|journals]] proves to be quite effective as part of English classes. Specifically, by writing "personal" and "text-related" journals, students find meaning in their own thoughts as well as in concepts learned in class. Personal [[Writing therapy|journaling]] is the recording of past and present personal thoughts and events in the student's life to enhance [[self-awareness]], student interest, and learning. Text-related journaling is writing about concepts learned in class in relation to students' personal experiences, to promote understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strategies that Work: Journals in the Classroom|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/strategy/strategy013.shtml|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==

The [[Nicodemus Wilderness Project]] provides an environmental experiential education program with a global reach called the "Apprentice Ecologist Initiative".  This scholarship-based opportunity is targeted for youth volunteers who want to help protect the environment.  The initiative seeks to develop young people for leadership roles by engaging them in environmental cleanup and conservation projects, empower volunteers to rebuild the environmental and social well-being of our communities, and improve local living conditions for both citizens and wildlife.

[[Presidential Classroom]], a non-profit civic education organization in [[Washington D.C.]], is open to high school students from across the country and abroad.  They meet and interact with government officials, media correspondents, congressman, and key players on the world stage to learn how public policy shapes many aspects of citizens' lives.  Students travel to Washington and spend a week hearing from prominent speakers, meet with interest group spokesmen and tour the national capital.  Students participate in a group project directed by experienced instructors; they have mediated debates on current issues facing the country.  The focus of the week is to give students a hands-on introduction to how "real world" politics take place.

[[Global College]], a four-year international study program offered by [[Long Island University]], is based on self-guided, experiential learning while a student is immersed in foreign cultures. Regional centers employ mostly advisors rather than teaching faculty; these advisors guide the individual students in preparing a "portfolio of learning" each semester to display the results of their experiences and projects.

The [[New England Literature Program]] in the English Department at the [[University of Michigan]] is a 45-day program, in which University instructors live and work together with 40  UM students in the woods of Maine in early spring.  They intensively study 19th and 20th-century  New England literature, in a program that includes creative writing in the form of academic journaling, as well as a deep physical engagement with the landscape of New England.  NELP students and staff take hiking trips into the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and other parts of the New England natural areas each week, integrating their experience of the landscape with writing and discussion of texts.

The [[Chicago Center for Urban Life and Culture]] is the only nonprofit and independent experiential educational program for college students in the United States.  The Chicago Center is distinguished by unique seminars characterized by a 'First Voice' pedagogy, its location in the multi-ethnic [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], and development of several hundred [[intern]]ship sites in [[Chicago]]. While many of the students who attend Chicago Center grew up in cities, the majority are from suburban, rural and farming communities. Students participate individually in its Semester, May Term and Summer Session.  The Chicago Center also designs and staffs programs for groups, what it calls "LearnChicago!", which promise non-tourist experiences in the city.

[[The Philadelphia Center]] is an off-campus program based on a model of experiential education.  Recognized by The Great Lakes Colleges Association, The Philadelphia Center is currently the only undergraduate level program that supports independent living and encourages the use of the city as a [[learning space]].

Several Australian high schools have established experiential education programmes, including [[Caulfield Grammar School]]'s five-week internationalism programme in [[Nanjing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Geelong Grammar School]]'s Timbertop outdoor education programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Tarica | first=Elisabeth | title=School of life | date=21 August 2006 | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/school-of-life/2006/08/18/1155408026033.html?page=fullpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|SODOTO}}At the professional school level, experiential education is often integrated into curricula in "clinical" courses following the medical school model of "See one, Do one, Teach one", in which students learn by practicing medicine.  This approach is being introduced in other professions in which skills are directly worked into courses to teach every concept (starting with interviewing, listening skills, negotiation, contract writing and advocacy, for example) to larger-scale projects in which students run [[Legal clinic|legal aid clinics]] or community loan programs, or write legislation or community development plans.

The [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] provides a framework for youth development professionals to employ experiential learning methods.

[[Lifeworks International]] offers experiential, service-learning programs for high school students. Trips combine adventure travel, cultural immersion, community service, and global education during expeditions in China, Thailand, India, Costa Rica, Peru, the British Virgin Islands, and Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.

In [[Legal Education]], critical pedagogy is associated with devising more equitable methods of teaching, helping students develop consciousness of freedom, and helping them connect knowledge to power.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt and Stephanie Ledesma, Experiential Education as Critical Pedagogy: Enhancing the Law School Experience, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498782&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in roles and structures==
Whether teachers employ experiential education in cultural journalism, [[service learning]], [[environmental education]], or more traditional school subjects, its key idea involves engaging [[student voice]] in active roles for the purpose of learning. Armstrong (2012) claims that students should be responsible for learning, not teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students participate in a real activity with real consequences for the purpose of meeting learning objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful student involvement: Students as partners in school change]''. Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential education uses various tools like field work, policy and civic activity, and entrepreneurship outside of the classroom along with games, simulations, role plays, stories in classrooms. The experiential education mindset changes the way the teachers and students view knowledge. Knowledge is no longer just some letters on a page. It becomes active, something that is transacted with in life or lifelike situations. It starts to make teachers experience and skill facilitators, and not just transmitters of the written word.

Besides changing student roles, experiential education requires a change in the role of teachers. When students are active learners, their endeavors often take them outside the classroom walls. Because action precedes attempts to synthesize knowledge, teachers generally cannot plan a curriculum unit as a neat, predictable package. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Teachers become active learners, too, experimenting together with their students, reflecting upon the learning activities they have designed, and responding to their students' reactions to the activities. In this way, teachers themselves become more active; they come to view themselves as more than just recipients of school district policy and curriculum decisions.

It is also important to point out that not all learners learn in the same way. As a result, there are diverse learners that have unique learning styles pertinent to their success as students. Studies have shown that cooperative learning is strongly suggested in a diverse learning atmosphere. "Contemporary views of learning and their pedagogical applications have begun to change traditional classroom interaction patterns, shaping the communicative roles of the teacher and students as participants in a classroom learning community," write David Wray &amp; Kristiina Kumpulainen. This paradigm shift in education gives both the student and teacher shared responsibility of the learning process. The teacher's participation in discussion sessions is to act as a facilitator, maintain classroom decorum, provide individual and group feedback, and alleviate concerns or issues in the lesson.

Critical thinking strategies are pertinent to the success of student-oriented learning. When students are engaged in active discussions, high-level thinking skills are put into practice to the point where students are synthesizing the information at a deeper level of understanding. According to [[Elliot Eisner]], "We need to provide opportunities for youngsters and adolescents to engage in challenging kinds of conversation, and we need to help them know how to do so. Such conversation is all too rare in schools. I use 'conversation' seriously, for challenging conversation is an intellectual affair. It has to do with thinking about what people have said and responding reflectively, analytically, and imaginatively to that process. The practice of conversation is almost a lost art. The most significant intellectual achievement is not so much in problem solving, but in question posing." Through experimental education, students are capable of finding their voice through '''peer-to-peer interaction'''. Students are now seen as [[child-centred|active participants]] in the learning process. [[Vygotsky]]`s social development theory requires students to play untraditional roles as they collaborate with one another through critical thinking and conversational skills. According to Ann Ketch, author of Conversation: The comprehension connection writes, "The oral process helps students clarify and solidify their thoughts. The thinking changes from what it was before the conversation took place. Through conversation, the student is in charge of his or her own mental processing. The teacher acts as a facilitator, pushing the student to rely upon and monitor his or her own comprehension, which fosters critical thinking." This is very vital because student conversation can elicit new ideas that may not have been mentioned or even thought of by another student. Therefore, student dialogue is very important because it helps individuals make sense of what is being learned. It also helps build respect for other's opinions while taking ownership of his or her learning process.

In experimental education, students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills by making connections to the real world. Therefore, effective learning entails active experimentation with a '''hands-on''' approach to learning. It is perceived that students learn more by being active. Students are '''interdependent''' in establishing group goals and decision-making skills. As a result, students are also capable of developing leadership skills, which can also enhance student motivation and confidence.

When students are given a choice in terms of content to be learned, it ensures the teacher that his or her learners are interactive in the learning process. According to Ernie Stringer, "'''Action learners''' move through continuous cycles of this inquiry process to improve their understanding, extend their knowledge, or refine their skills." When given a preference, students may feel motivated to take control of his or her learning experience. Student incentives are tied to progress in academic achievement. "Research indicates that intrinsic motivation stems from one's interests and capacities to surmount challenge s when presented or pursued," says Fenice B. Boyd. Many schools are encouraging teachers to tap into student interests with the hope that they transfer that motivation into the classroom.

Through the continuous cycle of learning, teacher's often work with students to develop a framework of knowledge, which is to be evaluated based on student input to the lessons content. Therefore, the teacher should establish criteria of what is to be learned as related to the student(s) choice in learning material. Ernie Stringer draws on the importance that "'''action research''' provides a process for developing a rich, engaging curriculum relevant to the lives and purposes of students, engaging their interests and abilities, and serving the broad human needs of community, society, and the planet. Creative construction of curricula or syllabi provides the means whereby the needs, perspectives, and/or interests of diverse stakeholders can be incorporated into vital, creative, effective programs of learning." In essence, a well-planned curriculum is designed for learning that encompasses a broad range of goals and individual needs that ensures the '''active learning''' process.

As students and teachers take on new roles, the traditional organizational structures of the school also may meet challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talpiot.macam.ac.il/hishtalmut/principles.htm Best practice: New standards for teaching and learning in America's schools.] Zemelman, Daniels, and Hyde, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the Challenger Middle School in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], service activities are an integral part of the academic program. Such nontraditional activities require teachers and administrators to look at traditional practices in new ways. For instance, they may consider reorganizing time blocks. They may also teach research methods by involving students in investigations of the community, rather than restricting research activities to the library (Rolzinski, 1990). {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

At the University Heights Alternative School in [[the Bronx]], the [[Project Adventure]] experiential learning program has led the faculty to adopt an all-day time block as an alternative to the traditional 45-minute periods. The faculty now organizes the curriculum by project instead of by separate disciplines. Schools that promote meaningful student involvement actively engage students as partners in education improvement activities. These young people learn while planning, researching, teaching, and making decisions that affect the entire education system.

Other university level programs are entirely field-taught on outdoor expeditions. These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers who are involved with the course subjects. These "hybrid" experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.

==Transitions from traditional to experiential==

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|Experiential education is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015 Skill Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At first, these new roles and structures may seem unfamiliar and uncomfortable to both students and adults in the school. Traditionally, students have most often been rewarded for competing rather than cooperating with one another. Teachers are not often called upon for collaborative work either. Teaching has traditionally been an activity carried out in isolation from one's peers, behind closed doors. Principals, accustomed to the traditional hierarchical structure of schools, often do not know how to help their teachers constitute self-managed work teams or how to help teachers coach students to work in cooperative teams. The techniques of experiential education can help students and staff adjust to teamwork, an important part of the process of reforming schools.

[[Adventure education]] may use the philosophy of experiential education in developing team and group skills in both students and adults (Rohnke, 1989). Initially, [[wikt:group|groups]] work to solve problems that are unrelated to the problems in their actual [[school]] environment. For example, in a [[ropes course]] designed to build the skills required by [[teamwork]], a faculty or student [[team]] might work together to get the entire group over a 12-foot wall or through an intricate web of rope. After each challenge in a series of this kind, the group looks at how it functioned as a team:

* Who took the [[leadership]] roles?
* Did the [[planning]] process help or hinder progress?
* Did people listen to one another in the group and use the strengths of all group members?
* Did everyone feel that the group was a supportive environment in which they felt comfortable making a contribution and taking [[risks]]?

The wall or web of rope can then become a [[metaphor]] for the [[classroom]] or [[school]] environment. While the problems and challenges of the [[classroom]] or [[school]] are different from the physical challenges of the adventure activity, many skills needed to respond successfully as a team are the same in both settings.

These skills &amp;mdash; [[listening]], recognizing each other's strengths, and supporting each other through difficulties &amp;mdash; can apply equally well to an academic [[Socratic Method]] of questioning or [[problem-solving]] toward schoolwide improvement efforts.

For example, the Kane School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] has been using adventure as a tool for [[school]] restructuring. The entire faculty &amp;mdash; particularly the Faculty Advisory Council, which shares the decisionmaking responsibilities with the principal &amp;mdash; has honed group skills through experiential education activities developed by [[Project Adventure]]. These skills include open [[communication]], methods of [[conflict resolution]], and mechanisms for [[decision making]] (High Strides, 1990).

==Development in Asian countries==

Established in 1973, ''Breakthrough'' in [[Hong Kong]] was the first non-profit organization that applied the concepts of experiential education (though primarily conceptualized in terms of outdoor adventure education) in youth works. Since then, development in experiential education has proceeded in [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]], and some large cities in [[China]].

Experiential methods in education have existed in China for thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  However, it should be noted that John Dewey was in China in the early 1900s and his ideas were extremely popular.  Interest in Dewey's experience in China and contribution is growing.

Experiential education started in [[Qatar]] in 2010 through [[AL-Bairaq]], which is an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the [[Center for Advanced Materials]] (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, using a hands-on-activities approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

There are multiple ways in which experiential education is practiced.  Examples of experiential learning methods used include:

*[[Active-based learning]] – All participants in the group must engage actively in working together toward the stated objectives.
*[[Place-based learning]] – The process of using local community and environment as a starting point to teach concepts in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects across the curriculum.
*[[Problem-based learning]] – Provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension.
*[[Project-based learning]] – An instructional method that uses projects as the central focus of instruction in a variety of disciplines.
*[[Service-learning]] – Providing meaningful service to a community agency or organization while simultaneously gaining new skills, knowledge and understanding as an integrated aspect of an academic program.
*[[Simulation-based learning]] – A combination of active, problem, project, and place-based learning; Participants are placed in a simulated environment and given objectives requiring constant attention and care.

All of these use the pattern of problem, plan, test and reflect as their foundation for the educative experience.

{{Nihongo|'''''Fushūgaku'''''|不就学}} is a Japanese term meaning non-attendance of [[Education in Japan|school]].

== Characteristics ==
There are a number of reasons as to why these children do not go to school. There are many cases where they cannot understand the Japanese language. In other cases they may be able to understand both Japanese and their own [[Mother tongue|native language]], but their level of conversation is insufficient to participate in class lessons. Bullying by native Japanese students may also contribute to their choice not to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s all too tentative opening to immigration|url=http://www.japanwatching.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:japans-all-too-tentative-opening-to-immigration&amp;catid=36:society&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=Japan Watching|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the children have parents who both work to support the family, and the children end up being left at [[Latchkey kid|home alone]]. In these families, they spend time together late at night after their parents stop working. On their parents' day off, they go out late at night together (shopping, etc.) They pass their time at autonomous Japanese language classrooms that were built for the children of foreigners. These parents are usually [[blue-collar worker]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Other reasons are that the parents of ''fushugaku'' children want their children to go to a school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford to send their children.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10864">'''Integrative learning''' is a [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]] describing a movement toward integrated lessons helping students make [[interdisciplinarity|connections across curricula]]. This higher education concept is distinct from the elementary and high school "integrated curriculum" movement.

==Term and concept ==
Integrative Learning comes in many varieties: connecting skills and knowledge from multiple sources and experiences; applying skills and practices in various settings; utilizing diverse and even contradictory points of view; and, understanding issues and positions contextually."

&lt;blockquote&gt;...making connections within a major, between fields, between curriculum, cocurriculum, or between academic knowledge and practice."&lt;ref&gt; Huber, M. T., Hutchings, P., &amp; Gale, R. (2005). ''Integrative Learning for Liberal Education.'' peerReview, Summer/Fall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integrated studies involve bringing together traditionally separate subjects so that students can grasp a more authentic understanding. Veronica Boix Mansilla, cofounder of the Interdisciplinary Studies Project at Project Zero, explains "when [students] can bring together concepts, methods, or languages from two or more disciplines or established areas of expertise in order to explain a phenomenon, solve a problem, create a product, or raise a new question" they are demonstrating interdisciplinary understanding. For over a decade, Project Zero researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education have been studying interdisciplinary work across a range of settings. They have found interdisciplinary understanding to be crucial for modern-thinking students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/integrated-studies-history|title=Integrated Studies: A Short History|first=Suzie|last=Boss|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edutopia]] highlighted Central York High School as a "School That Works" because of its successful integrated studies approach. For example, an AP government teacher and art teacher collaborated to create a joint project that asked students to create a sculpture based on the principles presented by the AP government class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/integrated-studies-experts|title=Integrated Studies: What Experts Say|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
AP government teacher Dayna Laur states that,
"Integrated studies projects [aim to] create a connectedness between disciplines that otherwise might seem unrelated to many students. Deliberately searching for ways in which you can mingle standards and content is imperative if you want to create truly authentic experiences because, in the world outside of the classroom, content is not stand-alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stw-integrated-studies-video-york-high-school-teachers|title=Integrating Art and Politics to Improve High School Student Engagement|first=Mariko|last=Nobori|date=22 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysd.k12.pa.us/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectionid=6/&amp;url_redirect=1 Central York High School - New High School Homepage 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated medical curriculum ==
In many American medical schools, an '''integrated curriculum''' refers to a non-compartmentalized approach to basic science learning.  As opposed to traditional medical curriculum, which separate subjects such as [[embryology]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]] and [[anatomy]], '''integrated curricula''' alternate lectures on these subjects over the course of the first two years. (Jonas 1989)  The course of study is instead organized around organ systems (such as "Cardiovascular" or "Gastrointestinal").  Another major component of the integrated medical curriculum is [[problem-based learning]].

==K-12 outcomes==
Interdisciplinary curricula has been shown by several studies to support students’ engagement and learning. Specifically integrating science with reading comprehension and writing lessons has been shown to improve students’ understanding in both science and English language arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://cie.asu.edu/ojs/index.php/cieatasu/article/view/745|title=Improving Student Engagement|first1=Jim|last1=Parsons|first2=Leah|last2=Taylor|date=6 May 2011|publisher=|volume=14|issue=1|via=cie.asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intercultural communicative competence in computer-supported collaborative learning''' is the application of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) to provide intercultural communicative competence (ICC).

==Essential ideas connecting CSCL and ICC==
One of the well-known applications of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|CSCL]] is telecollaboration involving the use of the Internet or other [[computer-mediated communication]] tools by internationally dispersed students in order to foster the development of foreign language linguistic and [[intercultural competence]] in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. (2003). Linguistic perspectives on the development of intercultural competence in telecollaboration. ''Language Learning &amp;amp; Technology'', ''7''(2), 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the technological mediation used in telecollaborative study, participants on each side of the network have cost-effective access to "[[Languaculture]]."

Numerous models and theories of [[intercultural communication]] have been proposed, including [[communication accommodation]] (Giles, 1973), cultural convergence (Barnett &amp; [[D. Lawrence Kincaid|Kincaid]], 1983), identity or [[face negotiation theory]] (Ting-Toomey, 1993), and [[interactive acculturation]] (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, &amp; Senecal, 1997). A model of ICC (or IC) widely accepted in foreign language education has been proposed by Byram.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, M. (1997). Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; This model includes five components, all of which are needed for a student to become an "intercultural speaker":

# attitudes: ''curiosity and openness, readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one's own.''
# knowledge: ''of social group and their products and practices in one's own and in one's interlocutor's country, and one of the general processes of societal and individual interaction.''
# skills of interpreting and relating: ''ability to interpret a document or event from another culture, to explain it and relate it to documents from one's own.''
# skills of discovery and interaction: ''ability to acquire new knowledge of a culture and cultural practices and the ability to operate knowledge, attitudes and skills under the constraints of real-time communication and interaction.''
# critical awareness or an evaluative orientation: ''an ability to evaluate critically and on the basis of explicit criteria perspectives, practices and products in one's own and other cultures and countries.''

==CSCL affordances&lt;!-- what is this supposed to mean? --&gt; for ICC==
The benefits as well as the challenges of utilizing CSCL as a means of intercultural communication must be considered. Research in the field indicates several advantages, including:

* Helps build [[Negotiation#The pervasive impact of culture on international negotiations.5B26.5D|negotiation]] strategies&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. &amp;amp; Muller-Hartmann, A. (2003).

==Challenges for ICC within CSCL environments==
However, despite the potential advantages of using CSCL to overcome the barriers of face-to-face prejudice, develop social skills, and increase cognitive flexibility, simply adding CSCL to a communicative situation does not automatically foster [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] nor resolve intercultural issues. In fact, research has indicated that some problems are made worse (or at least more obvious) by moving to a computer-supported medium:

* Face-to-face conversations always ebb and flow, but in the CSCL world, this ebb and flow can be misinterpreted, depending on the intercultural context, as boredom or even anger.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even in a synchronous CSCL environment, people are often not as fully engaged because of physical isolation; consistent and constant clarification of meaning, similar to the interactive process of [[semantic interoperability]] in computer systems, is necessary, a requirement which prolongs tasks and projects.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, T. (1997). Social interaction and the new media: The construction of communicative contexts. ''Nordicom Review'', ''2'', 63–75. Retrieved from [http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CSCL affords many choices among tools: from asynchronous email and discussion boards to synchronous chat and VoIP to visually present web cams and virtual worlds. However, when intercultural differences are considered, the tools are less interchangeable, and thus tool selection is more constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misunderstandings, including those which arise from intercultural differences, are not recognized (and cleared up) as quickly in CSCL environments.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Success depends on people feeling part of the group; bonding and [[interpersonal ties]] are more difficult to achieve at a distance, particularly with abstract and lengthy messages, which may be appropriate in some cultures but inappropriate in others.&lt;ref&gt;Wegeriff, R. (1998). The social dimensions of asynchronous learning networks. ''Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks'', ''2''(1), 34–49. Retrieved from [http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v2n1/v2n1_wegerif.asp http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v2n1/v2n1_wegerif.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Success depends on trust-building which is difficult to achieve in a computer-mediated environment which may be conducive only to selected intercultural contexts (for example, lack of self-disclosure is viewed as a positive trait in some cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because cultural preferences for activity, structure, and style vary among cultures, the creation of learning events requires careful consideration and additional design time on the part of the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;]
*  Hences comes the need for developing a critical crosscultural communicative competence in English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) preservice teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sehlaoui, A. S. (2001). Developing Cross-cultural Communicative Competence in Preservice ESL/EFL Teachers: A Critical Perspective Language, Culture, and Curriculum Journal, Vol. 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Without a facilitator to invigorate conversations and engage participants, communication is likely to decrease in CSCL environments due to the extra effort and extended timeframe required by the additional layer of intercultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, T. (2000). Making sense of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC): Conversations as genres, CMC Systems as genre ecologies. In Nunaker, J.F. &amp;amp; Sprague, R.

==Pedagogical implications and suggestions for implementation==
Although there are many benefits to using CSCL, especially in language learning contexts, teachers must approach its adoption with clear goals and objectives. Teachers should select the CSCL [[Medium (communication)|medium]] with careful consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning#Available Tools|tool]] selection is critical since different media work well for some people and not for others.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, instructors need to be familiar with concepts of intercultural communication in addition to CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Joia, L. (2002). Analysing a web-based e-commerce learning community: A case study in Brazil. ''Internet Research'', ''12''(4), 305–317.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of its application CSCL is not appropriate for short-term projects,&lt;ref&gt;Veermans, M. &amp;amp; Cesareni, D. (2005). The nature of the discourse in web-based Collaborative Learning Environments: Case studies from four different countries. ''Computers &amp;amp; Education'', ''45''(3), 316–336.&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers should expect to spend a considerable amount of extra management time in roles such as mediators, monitors, and facilitators.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who have little extra time should not implement CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

CSCL requires [[instructional scaffolding]] to accommodate different levels of foreign language ability&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd. R. (2005).

R. (2005). Negotiating sociocultural and institutional contexts: The case of Spanish-American telecollaboration. ''Language and Intercultural Communication'', ''5''(1), 40–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, CSCL may prove to be a superior tool through which teachers can foster greater understanding between their students and members of other cultures.

[[File:ISCA Project.png|thumb|ISCA - Israeli Students Combating Antisemitism - the official logo]] 
'''Israeli Students combating antisemitism''' ('''ISCA''') online has been founded in 2011 and operates with the purpose of fighting the growing [[antisemitism]], [[xenophobia]] and [[Holocaust denial]] on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishjournal.com/blogs/israelife/134584/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; https://jewsdownunder.com/2014/05/12/isca-israeli-students-combating-antisemitism/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=11906&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the program==
Israeli Students Combating Antisemitism (ISCA) is one of the world's leading initiatives for combating antisemitism, Holocaust denial &amp; racism online, designed by the [[National Union of Israeli Students]]. The program trains excelling students to monitor and respond to racist materials distributed online in exchange for academic credits or a [[scholarship]]. ISCA is a member of the International Network Against Cyber Hate (INACH)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inach.net/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.inach.net/isca/&lt;/ref&gt; and is taking an active role in shaping a civil discourse online together with NGO's and human rights organizations.
Tens of students from various academic institutions in [[Israel]] participate each year in the program. The students operate on various social media platforms, monitoring content on more than 10 languages, including answering questions regarding the Jewish nation, [[Holocaust]], [[Jewish history]] and reporting antisemitic questions published on social media.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/05/13/student-group-says-only-one-third-of-antisemitic-material-removed-from-youtube-facebook/&lt;/ref&gt;

The students operate in three teams: monitoring, [[Yahoo answers]] and new media. The monitoring team oversaes reporting and removing antisemitic content in the following social media platforms: [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]] and Vikontakte (Russian social media), monitoring content on more than 10 languages. The Yahoo Answers team includes students answering questions asked by Yahoo users regarding the Jewish nation, Holocaust, Jewish history etc. In addition, students report antisemitic questions published on the website. The new media team oversees the ongoing operation in different social media platforms: Facebook pages (English, French and Portuguese), Twitter (English and French), a YouTube channel and an Instagram account.
 
The program is leading in its field due to its special nature and operation and is appreciated by many countries. The program for combating antisemitism online is the biggest in the world for monitoring antisemitic content online and in the most languages, compared to other NGO's in the field. The program corporate with human rights organizations and NGO’S such as [[Yad Vashem]], [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]], Kantor Center&lt;ref&gt;http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/sites/default/files/ISCA%20Annual%20Report%202016-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, INACH and more.

==History==
The program for combating antisemitism online is the biggest in the world for monitoring antisemitic content online and in the most languages, compared to other [[NGO]]'s in the field. 
As part of the program's cooperation with various organizations, its representatives regularly participate in committees in the [[Knesset]] and in conferences around the world. In 2017 representatives participated in OSCE – a youth conference in Spain. In 2018, the program shared experiences of fighting antisemitism online at a special panel at the Global forum for antisemitism, organized by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs]].
In 2014, the Academic Program for Combating Antisemitism was established at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Herzliya&lt;ref&gt;https://www.idc.ac.il/en/pages/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;, to channel the program's activities to the academia. The program grants credit to around 30 students every year for academic training and two-semester activities. The academic program encourages students, both Jewish and non-Jewish, to initiate a personal project to eradicate the phenomenon of hatred on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.idc.ac.il/en/students/extracurricular/pages/isca.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Part of the achievements of the program over the years: On Facebook, monitoring over 21,000 antisemitic and Holocaust deniers, with an average removal rate of 44%. On Twitter, monitoring more than 17,000 accounts with an average removal rate of 60%. On YouTube, monitoring more than 6,000 videos with an average removal rate of 41%. On Instagram, monitoring more than 8,000 accounts and pictures with an average removal rate of 90%. On Yahoo Answers and Quora, answered over 3,000 questions.&lt;ref&gt;http://isca.idc.ac.il/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
* 2017 representatives participated in OSCE – a youth conference in Spain.
* 2018 – Participated at the Global Forum for Antisemitism&lt;ref&gt;http://antisemitism.mda.gov.il/en/the-global-forum-for-combating-antisemitism/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] ({{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and [[theologian]]. While his achievements in all of these areas are renowned, he was also dedicated to improving education in Britain; he did this on an individual level and through his support of the [[Dissenting academies]]. His [[grammar]] textbook was innovative and highly influential. More importantly, though, Priestley introduced a [[liberal arts]] curriculum at [[Warrington Academy]], arguing that a practical education would be more useful to students than a classical one. He was also the first to advocate the study and teaching of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], an interest driven by his belief that humanity was improving and could bring about [[Millennialism|Christ's Millennium]].

==Personal and institutional teaching==
Priestley was a teacher in one way or another throughout his entire adult life. Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: [[Latin]] (and perhaps Greek), [[History of geography#Marco Polo to the 18th century|geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[English grammar]]. Unusually for the time, he also taught [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy]]. In later years, when he lived in [[Leeds]] and [[Birmingham]], he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting [[Sunday school]]s for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 242-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of [[New College at Hackney]] on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the "proper Objects of Education" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]], it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], whose [[College of William &amp; Mary]] also followed Priestley's maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in [[natural philosophy]]. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a [[microscope]], for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In [[Calne]], where he was a tutor to the son of [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 14; Schofield, Vol. 2, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and "perambulator" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed [[magic lantern]] shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 245-6; Gibbs, 140; Uglow, 319-20; 407; Jackson, 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
In 1765, Priestley dedicated his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, Vol. 1, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between [[John Locke]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|left|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Priestley's ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar|Rudiments]]'' (1761)]]
Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in [[Nantwich]]. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the [[English language]] and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 1, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 83-5; 99-100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135; 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; His abiding interest in history, particularly [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] would not begin until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''. Need first edition publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Highly as we think of the ''wisdom of our ancestors'' we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]] decline narrative found in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume|David Hume's]] cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these ''Lectures''; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilizations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory underpinning Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history and his educational philosophy, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association. Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke|John Locke's]] theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charts of biography and history===
[[File:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published ''[[A Chart of Biography]]'' (1765)&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''New Chart of History'' (1769) (which he dedicated to [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A New Chart of History]]''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts and their accompanying ''Descriptions'' would allow students, Priestley said, to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education==
[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|left|thumb|upright|Title page from the second edition of ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'']]
Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at [[Daventry Academy]], he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, [[Philip Doddridge]]; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at [[Leeds]]. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18-30 to whom he taught "the elements of natural and revealed religion" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught "the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible"; and "an intermediate class" to whom he taught "knowledge of the Scriptures only."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170; Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later [[Sunday school]]s established by [[Robert Raikes]], Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them "the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course," something their parents could not provide.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: ''A Catechism for Children and Young Persons'' (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A catechism for children, and young persons''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers'' (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A scripture catechism, consisting of a series of questions, with references to the scriptures instead of answers''. need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to write non-sectarian ''Catechisms'', but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in [[Birmingham]], when he became a minister at New Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170-1; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kahoot!''' is a [[Game based learning|game-based learning]] platform, used as [[educational technology]] in schools and other educational institutions. Its learning games, "Kahoots", are multiple-choice quizzes that allow user generation and can be accessed via a [[web browser]].

Kahoot! can be used to review students' knowledge, for [[formative assessment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cit.duke.edu/blog/2015/07/kahoot-as-formative-assessment/|title=Kahoot! as Formative Assessment - Center for Instructional Technology|date=2015-07-02|work=Center for Instructional Technology|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a break from traditional classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tomorrowslearners.com/why-kahoot-is-one-of-my-favourite-classroom-tools/|title=Why Kahoot is one of my favourite classroom tools — Tomorrow's Learners|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahoot! also includes [[trivia]] quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/home/explore/teens/notes-from-the-underground/teens/2017/05/22/kahoot-trivia|title=Kahoot Trivia|website=www.acpl.lib.in.us|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==
Kahoot was founded by Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker and Morten Versvik in a joint project with the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, they teamed up with Professor Alf Inge Wang, and were later joined by Norwegian entrepreneur Åsmund Furuseth.[https://kahoot.com/company/]
== Overview ==
[[File:Kahoot Oslo.jpg|thumb|left|A game of Kahoot! being played in a lecture-hall at the [[University of Oslo]].]]

Kahoot was designed for [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]], with learners gathered around a common screen such as an [[interactive whiteboard]], projector or a computer monitor. The site can also be used through [[Videotelephony|screen-sharing]] tools such as [[Skype]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.microsoft.com/skypekahoot|title=Skype in the Classroom &amp; Kahoot - Microsoft in Education|website=education.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Google Hangouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kahoot.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/827223-can-i-play-kahoot-with-others-remotely|title=Can I play Kahoot! with others remotely?|last=|first=|date=|website=Kahoot! Support|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[game design]] is such that the players are required to frequently look up from their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inclusivedesign.no/ict/kahoot-article172-261.html|title=Kahoot! - Inclusive Design|last=www.corepublish.no|first=CorePublish -|website=www.inclusivedesign.no|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay is simple; all players connect using a generated game [[Personal identification number|PIN]] shown on the common screen, and use a device to answer questions created by a teacher, business leader, or other person. These questions can be changed to award points. Points then show up on the leaderboard after each question. 

Kahoot can be played through different [[web browser]]s and mobile devices through its web interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kahoot.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/498970-is-my-browser-device-suitable-to-host-or-play-a-ka|title=Is my browser/device suitable to host or play a Kahoot? – Kahoot!

=== Kahoot Jumble ===
Kahoot added a new feature in 2016, called Jumble. Users create quizzes with exactly four options (it is always exactly four) in the correct order. Kahoot automatically randomizes the answers during the game. Users have to move the triangle, diamond, circle and square up and into the right order. Then users have to press a blue, circular button with a white text that says "K!" under the rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17T4T5wGKQ&lt;/ref&gt; If a user suspects that the answers are in the wrong order, the rectangles will have to be moved down back to its original position before it can be moved back up to the correct position again.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Kinesthetic learning''' (American English), '''kinaesthetic learning''' (British English), or '''tactile learning''' is a [[learning style]] in which [[learning]] takes place by the students carrying out physical activities, rather than listening to a lecture or watching demonstrations. As cited by Favre (2009), Dunn and Dunn define kinesthetic learners as students who require whole-body movement to process new and difficult information.&lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Kinesthetic intelligence, which was originally coupled with tactile abilities, was defined and discussed in Howard Gardner's ''[[Frames Of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]'' in 1983. In this book, Gardner describes activities such as dancing and performing surgery as requiring great kinesthetic intelligence: using the body to create (or do) something.

[[Margaret H'Doubler]] wrote and spoke about kinesthetic learning during the 1940s, defining kinesthetic learning as the human body's ability to express itself through movement and dance.

===The VARK model===
Neil Fleming, a New Zealand teacher and educational theorist, designed the VARK model (visual, aural or auditory, read/write and kinesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fleming’s model, kinesthetic learners are similar to tactile learners in that they like hands-on experiential learning. They excel in concrete learning such as on-the-job training, work experience, internships, simulations and so forth (Kte’pi, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Learning styles#Neil Fleming.27s VAK.2FVARK model|Fleming VAK/VARK model]] (one of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles)&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2.  SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; categorized learning styles as follows:
* [[Hands-on learning]]
* [[Visual learning]]
* [[Auditory learning]]
* Read/write learning
* Kinesthetic learning
Skill memory also fits into the category of kinesthetic learning, as it is what happens when somebody is learning kinesthetically. Skill memories are difficult to convey except by direct demonstration, may be acquired without awareness, and require several repetitions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior|last=Gluck|first=M.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Rita Dunn contends that kinesthetic and tactile learning are the same style.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Rita.  2009. Title: Impact of Learning-Style Instructional Strategies on Students' Achievement and Attitudes: Perceptions of Educators in Diverse Institutions.&lt;/ref&gt; Galeet BenZion asserts that kinesthetic and tactile learning are separate learning styles, with different characteristics. She defined kinesthetic learning as the process that results in new knowledge (or understanding) with the involvement of the learner's body movement. This movement is performed to establish new knowledge or extend existing knowledge. Kinesthetic learning is at its best, BenZion found, when the learner uses language (their own words) in order to define, explain, resolve and sort out how their body's movement reflects the concept explored. One example is a student using movement to work out the sum of 1/2 plus 3/4 via movement, then explaining how their motions in space reflect the mathematical process leading to the correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;BenZion(Westreich), Galeet.  1999.  An analysis of kinesthetic learners' responses: teaching mathematics through dance.  Doctoral Dissertation.  American University, Washington D.C..&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Denig (2004) in his article ‘Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions’, presented Dunn and Dunn’s Learning Styles Model, which addresses 21 elements that affect students’ learning. These elements are broken down into five stimuli: environmental, emotional, sociological, physiological and psychological variables. Under this model, physiological stimuli consist of four elements, one of which is perceptual. Perceptual depicts the auditory, visual, tactual and kinesthetic styles whereby learners learn more effectively. This gives meaning to the concept that kinesthetic learners learn best through whole-body activities and experiences while tactual learners learn best through manipulation of items with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Denig, S. J. (2004). Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions. Teachers College Record, 106(1), 96-111. Retrieved from https://journals-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.brocku.ca/pdf/01614681/v106i0001/96_mialstcd.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinesthetic memory==
Depending upon [[Mnemonic|memory systems]] the kinesthetic learners respond differently. The different kinds of learners mainly include whole body learners, hands-on learners, doodlers, students learning through emotional experiences. The learning and the memory is generally short term. To achieve a long term memory different techniques can be used depending on the learning style. Mind mapping, story mapping, webbing, drawing can be used to enhance the learning of a doodler.  For the hands-on learner, role play, clay, building and math manipulative can be used. The whole book body learner can learn better through role-playing, body mapping, puzzles and use of computer technology which allows for certain movement while learning. Students can be engaged in group activities and activities which involve bodily movement such as dance, drama, sports can be used to nurture their learning. The following strategies can be used to facilitate kinesthetic memory through procedural motor pathway such as:
* [[Dance]]: ideas, concepts and processes can be expressed through creative movements
* Laboratory demonstrations
* [[Sport]]s
* [[Gymnastics]]
* [[Charades]]
The kinesthetic learners who have memories associated with [[emotion]]s learning can be facilitated through dance, [[debate]], [[drama]], [[Role-playing|role-play]], and charades. This kind of learning leads to a [[long-term memory]] since it is associated with emotions such as [[wikt:excitement|excitement]], [[curiosity]], [[anger]], [[disappointment]] and success.&lt;ref name="Sprenger2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilee Sprenger|title=Differentiation Through Learning Styles and Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaVu2p5uDBkC&amp;pg=PA113|date=22 April 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-9504-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of skill memory ==
Perceptual-motor skills are skills learned by movement patterns guided by sensory inputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance.  A ballerina learns a specific set of moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option.  Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports.  A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can't know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful.  Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories.  Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well.  Cognitive skills are skills which require individuals to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move their bodies based on what they perceive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Solving a puzzle would be an example of a cognitive skill.

==Management strategies==
Learners with kinesthetic preferences learn through active movements and [[experience]]s. Activities such as [[Play (activity)|playing]], [[puppetry]], [[drama]], [[acting]] and [[design]]ing ensures involvement of the learners. Thus, it is also important to manage the students during such activities.&lt;ref name="SimsSims1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald R. Sims|author2=Serbrenia J. Sims|title=The Importance of Learning Styles: Understanding the Implications for Learning, Course Design, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECi3gFMEvh8C&amp;pg=PA53|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29278-1|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some effective [[Strategy|strategies]] used to involve unmotivated students during activities are:
* Motivate the students by giving attention and [[Reward management|reward]], avoid [[punishment]].
* Students should be provided with option to choose activities for learning a particular concept
* Grades can be allotted depending on the participation by using score rubrics
* Activities chosen should encourage all the students to succeed and feel that have accomplished [[learning]] through an activity
* Every student has to be given equal opportunity to participate
* Cooperative activities can be organized and positive feedback can be given to encourage [[teamwork]] in a class
Some effective strategies used to manage hyper motivated students are:
* Encourage the students to organize body movement during activities
* Regular monitoring of the students 
* Appropriate and accurate directions have to be given for any activity
* Before involving the students in the activity, the consequences of the task going out of control has to be clearly explained.&lt;ref name="LengelKuczala2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Traci Lengel|author2=Mike Kuczala|title=The Kinesthetic Classroom: Teaching and Learning Through Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUA4zKBlsrsC|date=26 January 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-7120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinesthetic Learners in the Classroom===

Subjects can be taught to cater for kinesthetic learners. Through a strength-based and learner-centered approach, educators should engage kinesthetic students in activities that require movements because they learn by doing. Activities could include role-plays, drama, dance, races and competitions, field trips and projects.

Favre (2009) stated that instructional strategies should include movement in a game-like format. Favre suggested designing kinesthetic games. For example, “game boards such as Tic-Tac-Toe affixed to the classroom floor and hopscotch template painted on the playground tarmac or sidewalks around the school” (p. 32). Favre also suggested that instructors can use “commercial games such as Twister, Jeopardy and Nerf basketball and create game cards that align with their lesson objectives” (pp.32-33) &lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009, March 1). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Reese &amp; Dunn (2007) in their research of college freshmen learning styles provided recommended that "to ensure success for kinesthetic learners, classes should provide active experiences for planning or carrying out objectives, such as visits, project, role playing, simulations and floor or wall games"(p. 108). &lt;ref&gt;Reese, V. L., &amp; Dunn, R. (2007). Learning-Style Preferences of a Diverse Freshmen Population in a Large, Private, Metropolitan University by Gender and GPA. Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice, 9(1), 95-112. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of evidence==
Although the concept of [[learning styles]] is popular among educators in some countries (and children and adults express preferences for particular modes of learning), there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes; on the contrary, there is substantial evidence that the meshing hypothesis (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

Proponents state that the evidence related to kinesthetic learners benefiting from specialized instruction (or targeted materials) appears mixed at best; the [[diagnosis]] of kinesthetic and tactile learning is coupled (rather than isolated), and teachers are likely to misdiagnose students' learning styles.

On the other hand, studies do show that mixed-modality presentations (for instance, using auditory and visual techniques) improve results in a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name=Coffield&gt;Coffield, F., Moseley, D., Hall, E., Ecclestone, K. (2004). [http://www.lsda.org.uk/files/PDF/1543.pdf ''Learning styles and pedagogy in post-16 learning. A systematic and critical review''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205043419/http://www.lsda.org.uk/files/PDF/1543.pdf |date=2008-12-05 }}. London: Learning and Skills Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Instruction that stimulates more than auditory learning (for example, kinesthetic learning) is more likely to enhance learning in a heterogeneous student population.&lt;ref&gt;BenZion, Galeet (2010).  Does a change in mathematics instructional strategies lead struggling third grade students to increase their performance on standardized tests?.  Master's thesis.  University of Maryland at College Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain substrates involved ==
There are three parts of the brain that are the most important to kinesthetic and skill learning.  The [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebral cortex]], and the [[cerebellum]] all play equally important roles in the ability to learn new skills and master them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience: A Brain-Mind Odyssey|last=Presti|first=D.|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basal ganglia are a collection of ganglia (clusters of neurons) that lie at the base of the forebrain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   The basal ganglia receive information from other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortical areas that send messages about the outside world.  Most of these messages are sensory, meaning what a person is physically feeling.  The basal ganglia then interpret this information and sends it on a path to the thalamus and the brainstem which both play large factors in physical movement. Therefore, the basal ganglia are the beginning of the process for somebody who is learning-by-doing to respond viscerally to the stimuli around them.  It is important once a skill is learned to practice it.  This can change how basal ganglia circuits participate in the performance of that skill and that synaptic plasticity is a basic neural mechanism enabling such changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The more a person practices, the more plasticity they develop.

The cerebral cortex is the brain tissue covering the top and sides of the brain in most vertebrates. It is involved in storing and processing of sensory inputs and motor outputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the human brain, the cerebral cortex is actually a sheet of neural tissue about 1/8th inch thick.  The sheet is folded so that it can fit inside the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The neural circuits in this area of the brain expand with practice of an activity, just like the synaptic plasticity grows with practice.  Clarification of some of the mechanisms of learning by neuro science has been advanced, in part, by the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (FMRI). These technologies have allowed researchers to observe human learning processes directly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How People Learn: Brian, mind, Experience and School|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these types of technologies, we are now able to see and study what happens in the process of learning.  In different tests performed the brain being imaged showed a greater blood flow and activation to that area of the brain being stimulated through different activities such as finger tapping in a specific sequence.  It has been revealed that the process at the beginning of learning a new skill happens quickly, and later on slows down to almost a plateau.  This process can also be referred to as The Law of Learning.  The slower learning showed in the FMRI that in the cerebral cortex this was when the long term learning was occurring, suggesting that the structural changes in the cortex reflect the enhancement of skill memories during later stages of training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   When a person studies a skill for a longer duration of time, but in a shorter amount of time they will learn quickly, but also only retain the information into their [[short-term memory]].  Just like studying for an exam; if a student tries to learn everything the night before, it will not stick in the long run.  If a person studies a skill for a shorter duration of time, but more frequently and long-term, their brain will retain this information much longer as it is stored in the [[long-term memory]].  Functional and structural studies of the brain have revealed a vast interconnectivity between diverse regions of the cerebral cortex.  For example, large numbers of axons interconnect the posterior sensory areas serving vision, audition, and touch with anterior motor regions.  Constant communication between sensation and movement makes sense, because to execute smooth movement through the environment, movement must be continuously integrated with knowledge about one's surroundings obtained via sensory perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The cerebral cortex plays a role in allowing humans to do this.

The cerebellum is critical to the ability for a human or animal to be able to regulate movement.  This area of the brain wraps around the brainstem and is very densely packed with neurons and neural connections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This part of the brain is involved in timing as well as movement.  It assists in predicting events, especially in the formation, execution, and timing of conditioned responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cerebellum plays a very important role in all forms of kinesthetic learning and motor function.  For a ballerina, it is important to be able to control their movements and time it exactly right for their routine.  For a football player it is important to be able to regulate movement when running throwing, and being able to have control over where the ball goes as well as the timing of it.

All three of these important systems in the brain function together as a team, one not being more important than the other.  They work together to allow for responding to sensory events, timing, controlling physical actions, and more.  However, it is important to remember than unless a person is actively practicing, these parts of the brain won't help them get to their full potential. Alterations in the brain that occur during learning seem to make the nerve cells more efficient or powerful. Studies have shown that animals raised in complex environments have a greater volume of capillaries per nerve cell—and therefore a greater supply of blood to the brain—than the caged animals, regardless of whether the caged animal lived alone or with companions. Overall, these studies depict an orchestrated pattern of increased capacity in the brain that depends on experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7255">'''Language learning aptitude''' refers to the "prediction of how well, relative to other individuals, an individual can learn a [[foreign language]] in a given amount of time and under given conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield, Charles W. "Language Aptitude Reconsidered." ''ERIC Digest''. Washington DC: ERIC Clearinghouse on Languages and Linguistics, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many measures of aptitude, language learning aptitude is thought to be relatively stable once a person matures. Many people show a remarkable learning aptitude for learning their language.

== Language learning disability ==

Some high schools, universities or other institutions will interpret low language learning aptitude as a sign of a language learning disability.  A pattern of evidence from several sources can help to diagnose a foreign language learning disability.  Evidence can come from scoring poorly on language learning aptitude assessments, like the [[Modern Language Aptitude Test]], [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]], [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary]] or [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], while attaining average or above-average scores on aptitude assessments in other areas, like general intelligence.  A history of scoring poorly on an array of language aptitude tests taken at the appropriate time ([[Modern Language Aptitude Test#Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary|MLAT-E]] for grades 3–6, [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery|PLAB]] for grades 7–12, [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|MLAT]] for adults) can provide even stronger evidence for a language learning disability.  Evidence can also come from comparing a poor past performance in foreign language courses with average or above-average performance in other courses unrelated to language learning.

Language aptitude is one of the important factors that determined L2 later learners' ultimate achievement, but it has less effect on L2 early learners.&lt;ref&gt; Ortega, L. (2013). Understanding second language acquisition. London : Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== John B. Carroll ==

[[John B. Carroll]], an influential psychologist in the field of educational linguistics, developed a theory about a cluster of four abilities that factored into language learning aptitude, separate from verbal intelligence and motivation.  Using these four distinct abilities (phonetic coding ability, grammatical sensitivity, rote learning ability, and inductive learning ability), Carroll developed the MLAT, a language aptitude assessment for adults.

The four ability components are defined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Component
!Definition
|-
|Phonetic coding ability
|ability to perceive distinct sounds, associate a symbol with that sound and retain that association
|-
|Grammatical memory
| ability to recognize the grammatical function of a lexical element (word, phrase, etc.) in a sentence without explicit training in grammar
|-
|Associative memory
| ability to learn associations between words in a foreign language and their meanings and retain that association
|-
|Inductive learning ability
| ability to infer or induce rules governing the structure of a language
|}

== Paul Pimsleur ==

[[Paul Pimsleur]], also known for the [[Pimsleur language learning system]], spent time researching four factors that he believed to be related to language learning aptitude.  Pimsleur included grade point average as an indication of general academic achievement as well as motivation in his factors.  In addition, the verbal ability factor indicated how well a student would be able to handle the mechanics of learning a foreign language and the auditory factor indicated how well a student would be able to listen to and produce phrases in a foreign language.  To test these four factors, Pimsleur developed the [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]].

== Uses of aptitude measurement ==

Measurements of language learning aptitude are used in many different ways.  The United States Department of Defense uses a measurement of language learning aptitude, the [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], to help place employees in positions that require them to learn a new language.

Governmental agencies use the MLAT as a tool to select and place employees in intensive language training programs.  Businesses and missionaries use the MLAT to select, place and plan for language training.  Universities, colleges and high schools use the MLAT to help in the diagnosis of foreign language learning disabilities.  Although each institution has its own policy, many will waive a foreign language requirement in cases of a foreign language learning disability in favor of a history or linguistic course.

Schools use the PLAB and MLAT-E to place students in suitable language courses, build a history of a foreign language learning difficulty, identify especially gifted students in respect to language learning and to match learning styles with instructional styles.

'''Language attrition''' is the process of losing a [[First language|native, or first, language]]. This process is generally caused by both isolation from speakers of the first language and the acquisition and use of a [[second language]], which interferes with the correct production and comprehension of the first. Such [[Language transfer|interference]] from a second language is likely experienced to some extent by all [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], but is most evident among speakers for whom a language other than their first has started to play an important, if not dominant, role in everyday life; these speakers are at a higher risk for experiencing language attrition.&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&amp;%20Kopke%202007.pdf Köpke, Barbara., Schimd, Monika (2007) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/Laboratoire de Neuropsycholinguistique, Université de Toulouse, Le Mirail, France "Bilingualism and Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this is found in immigrants, who may move to a country in which a language foreign to them is spoken, and go on to use that later-learned environmental language in their daily lives. Their gradual decline in proficiency in their first language, or L1, resulting from both isolation from other speakers of their L1 and interference from the L2 they are acquiring, is considered language attrition.

There are a number of factors which may affect the process of L1 attrition. Frequent exposure and use of a particular language is often assumed adequate to maintain the native language system intact. However, research has often failed to confirm this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babylonia.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2008-2/schmid_01.pdf Schimd, Monika (2008) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands "Defining Language Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A positive attitude towards the potentially attriting language or its speech community and motivation to retain the language are other factors which may reduce the effects of attrition. This factor too is difficult to confirm by research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&amp;%20Dusseldorp%202010.pdf Dusseldorp, Elise., Schimd, Monika (2010) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/TNO, Quality of Life &amp; Leiden University, The Netherlands "Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, age of the [[wikt:attriter|attriter]] can well predict the likelihood of attrition; children are demonstrably more likely to lose their first language than adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2009.00521.x | volume=59 | title=Maturational Constraints and First Language Attrition | year=2009 | journal=Language Learning | pages=687–715 | last1 = Bylund | first1 = Emanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/bookshl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YUQ9AAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=K%C3%B6pke,+B.+and+Schmid,+M.S.+2004:+First+language+attrition:+the+next+phase.+In+Schmid,+M.S.,+K%C3%B6pke,+B.,+Keijzer,+M.+and+Weilemar,+L.,+editors,+First+language+attrition:+interdisciplinary+perspectives+on+methodological++issues.+Amsterdam/Philadelphia:+John&amp;ots=qvh0yLDh5l&amp;sig=_8DMmm-r6aBAQ3xedGp7m9Ggotc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Köpke &amp; Schmid 2004] Schmid, M.

However, the overall impact of these factors is far less strongly pronounced than what has been found in second language acquisition.

Language attrition results in a decrease of language proficiency from what was previously acquired. The current consensus is that attrition manifests itself first and most noticeably in the vocabulary knowledge of speakers (in their lexical access and their mental lexicon)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Schmid, M. S., Köpke, B., Keijzer, M., &amp; Weilemar, L. (Eds.). (2004). First language attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues (Vol. 28). John Benjamins Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; while grammatical and especially phonological representations appear more stable among speakers for whom emigration took place after puberty.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | year = 2009 | title = On L1 attrition and the linguistic system | url = | journal = EUROSLA Yearbook | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 212–244 | doi = 10.1075/eurosla.9.11sch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The term ''first language attrition'' (FLA) refers to the gradual decline in native language proficiency. As speakers use their L2 frequently and become proficient (or even dominant) in it, some aspects of the L1 can deteriorate or become subject to L2 influence.

The study of language attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 conference at the University of Pennsylvania called "Loss of Language Skills".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Richard D., Freed, Barbara F.. 1982.&amp;nbsp;''The Loss of language skills''. The University of California&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of second language, or L2, attrition and to ideate on possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, as well as a series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European Second Language Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shmid | first1 = Monika | year = 2004 | title = First language attrition: The methodology revised | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 239–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"/&gt;

To study the process of language attrition, researchers initially looked at neighboring areas of linguistics to identify which parts of the L1 system attrite first; lacking years of experimental data of attrition itself, linguists studied [[language contact]], [[Creole genesis|creolization]], [[Second-language acquisition|L2 acquisition]], and [[aphasia]], and applied their findings to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"/&gt;

One issue that is faced when researching attrition is distinguishing between normal L2 influence on the L1 and actual attrition of the L1. Since all bilinguals experience some degree of [[Crosslinguistic influence|cross linguistic influence]], where the L2 interferes with the retrieval of the speaker's L1, it is difficult to determine if delays and/or mistakes in the L1 are due to attrition or cause by CLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Lowie | first3 = W. | year = 2011 | title = Introduction: From structure to chaos.&amp;nbsp; | url = | journal = Modeling Bilingualism Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1075/sibil.43.02intro }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, simultaneous bilinguals may not have a language that is indistinguishable from that of a native speaker or a language where their knowledge of it is less extensive than a native speaker's; therefore testing for attrition is difficult.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
===Lexical attrition===

The first linguistic system to be affected by first language attrition is the lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Köpke | first1 = B. | last2 = Schimd | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Keijzer | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Dostert | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Language attrition: theoretical perspectives | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical-semantic relationship usually starts to deteriorate first and most quickly, driven by Cross Linguistic Interference (CLI) from the attriter's L2, and it is believed to be exacerbated by continued exposure to, and frequent use of, the L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Lexical access and lexical diversity in first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 04| pages = 729–748 | doi = 10.1017/s1366728913000771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for such interlanguage effects can be seen in a study by Pavlenko (2003, 2004) which shows that there was some semantic extension from the L2, which was English, into the L1 Russian speakers' lexicons. In order to test for lexical attrition, researchers use tests such as picture naming tasks, where they place a picture of an item in front of the participant and ask them to name it, or by measuring lexical diversity in the speaker's spontaneous speech (speech that is unprompted and improvised). In both cases, attriters performed worse than non-attriters.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Ammerlaan, T. (1996). "You get a bit wobbly...": exploring bilingual lexical retrieval processes in the context of first language attrition. Nijmegen, Netherlands: S.n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hulsen, M. (2000). Language loss and language processing: three generations of Dutch migrants in New Zealand. S.l.: S.n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montrul | first1 = S. A. | year = 2009 | title = Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: re-examining the age factor | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism| volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | year = 2002 | title = First Language Attrition, Use and Maintenance | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 258 | doi = 10.1075/sibil.24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis suggests that when a speaker tries to access a lexical item from their L1 they are also competing with the translation equivalents of their L2 and that there is either a problem with activating the L1 due to infrequent use or with the inhibition of the competing L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

===Grammatical attrition===

Grammatical attrition can be defined as "the disintegration of the structure of a first language (L1) in contact situations with a second language (L2)".&lt;ref&gt;Seliger, H. W., &amp; Vago, R. M. (1991). First language attrition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of bilingual Swedes raised outside of Sweden, who in their late twenties returned to their home country for schooling, there was noted to be attrition of their L1. The participants demonstrated a complete retention of the underlying syntactic structure of their L1. Notably, they exhibited the V2, verb second, word order present in most Germanic languages, except English. This rule requires the tense-marked verb of a main clause to occur in the second position of the sentence, even if that means it comes before the subject (e.g. there is an adverb at the beginning of the sentence). These speakers' ability to form sentences with V2 word order was compared against L2 learners who often overproduce the rigid SVO word order rather than applying the V2 rule. Although the study did not show evidence for attrition of syntax of the person's L1, there was evidence for attrition in the expatriates' morphology, especially in terms of agreement. They found that the bilinguals would choose to use the unmarked morphemes in place of the marked one when having to differentiate between gender and plurality; also they tend to overgeneralize where certain morphemes can be used. For example, they may use the suffix /-a/, which is used to express an indefinite plural, and overextend this morpheme to also represent the indefinite singular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Håkansson | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Syntax and morphology in language attrition: a study of five bilingual expatriate Swedes | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 153–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1473-4192.1995.tb00078.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence to support the view that there is a complete restructuring of the language systems. That is, even under language attrition the syntax is largely unaffected and any variability observed is thought to be due to interference from another language, rather than attrition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Tsimpli, I., Sorace, A., Heycock, C., &amp; Filiaci, F. (2004). First language attrition and syntactic subjects: a study of Greek and Italian near-native speakers of English" ''International Journal of Bilingualism'' 8(3), 257-277. Retrieved from http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~antonell/TsimpliSoraceHeycockFiliaci2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsimpli | first1 = I. M. | year = 2007 | title = First language attrition from a minimalist perspective: Interface vulnerability and processing effects | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism Language Attrition | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 83–98 | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33.07tsi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use language differently from native speakers. In particular, they can have variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically.&lt;ref&gt;Sorace, A. 2005. "Selective optionality in language development". In: Cornips, L. &amp; Corrigan, K. P., (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Syntax and Variation: reconciling the biological and the social'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55–80 Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: the same individuals do not appear to encounter recurring problems with the same kinds of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2004. "Convergent outcomes in L2 acquisition and L1 loss". In: Schmid, M. S., Köpke, B., Keijzer, M. &amp; Weilemar, L. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''First Language Attrition: interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues''&amp;nbsp;(pp.&amp;nbsp;259–279). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2008.&amp;nbsp;''Incomplete Acquisition in Bilingualism: re-examining the age factor''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological attrition===

Phonological attrition is a form of language loss that affects the speaker's ability to produce their native language with their native accent. A study of five native speakers of American English who moved to Brazil and learned Portuguese as their L2 demonstrates the possibility that one could lose one's L1 accent in place of an accent that is directly influenced by the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It is thought that phonological loss can occur to those who are closer to native-like fluency in the L2, especially in terms of phonological production, and for those who have immersed themselves and built a connection to the culture of the country for the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A sociolinguistic approach to this phenomenon is that the acquisition of a native-like L2 accent and the subsequent loss of one's native accent is influenced by the societal norms of the country and the speakers' attempt to adapt in order to feel a part of the culture they are trying to assimilate into.&lt;ref&gt;Major, R. (1994). Sociolinguistic factors in loss and acquisition of phonology. In K. Hyltenstam &amp; A. Viberg (Eds.), Progression and Regression in Language: Sociocultural, Neuropsychological and Linguistic Perspectives (pp. 463-478). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511627781.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attrition is not to be confused with contact-induced change since that would mean speech production changes due to an increased use of another language and not due to the less frequent use of the L1.&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, C., &amp; Lin, Y. (2015). Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka. Prosody and Language in Contact Prosody, Phonology and Phonetics, 189-220. {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-662-45168-7_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and hypotheses==
Lambert and Moore&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, R. D. &amp; Moore, S. J. (1986). "Problem Areas in the Study of Language Attrition". In: Weltens, B., de Bot, K. &amp; van Els, T. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Language Attrition in Progress, Studies on Language Acquisition''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;177 – p.&amp;nbsp;186). Dordrecht, NL: Foris Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define numerous hypotheses regarding the nature of language loss, crossed with various aspects of language. They envisioned a test to be given to American [[State Department]] employees that would include four linguistic categories ([[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]], and [[phonology]]) and three skill areas ([[reading (activity)|reading]], [[listening]], and [[Speech communication|speaking]]). A translation component would feature on a sub-section of each skill area tested. The test was to include linguistic features that are the most difficult, according to teachers, for students to master. Such a test may confound testing what was not acquired with what was lost. Lambert, in personal communication with Köpke and Schmid,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; described the results as 'not substantial enough to help much in the development of the new field of language skill attrition'.

The use of translation tests to study language loss is inappropriate for a number of reasons: it is questionable what such tests measure; too much [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]]; the difference between attriters and [[multilingualism|bilinguals]] is complex; activating two languages at once may cause interference. Yoshitomi&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Yoshitomi, A. (1992). "Towards a Model of Language Attrition: neurological and psychological contributions". In:&amp;nbsp;''Issues in Applied Linguistics''; Vol 3, No 2: 293-318.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define a model of language attrition that was related to [[neurological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of language learning and unlearning. She discussed four possible hypotheses and five key aspects related to acquisition and attrition. The hypotheses are:
* 1. Reverse order: last learned, first forgotten. Studies by Russell&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Robert (1999). "Lexical maintenance and attrition in Japanese as a second language". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;114 – p.&amp;nbsp;141). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hayashi&lt;ref&gt;Hayashi, Brenda (1999). "Testing the regression hypotheis: the remains of the Japanese negation system in Micronesia". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).&amp;nbsp;''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;154 – p.&amp;nbsp;168). Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; both looked at the Japanese negation system and both found that attrition was the reverse order of acquisition. Yoshitomi and others, including Yukawa,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Yukawa, E. (1998).&amp;nbsp;''L1 Japanese Attrition and Regaining: three case studies of two early bilingual children''. Tokyo: Kurosio Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that attrition can occur so rapidly, it is impossible to determine the order of loss.
* 2. Inverse relation: better learned, better retained. Language items that are acquired first also happen to be those that are most reinforced. As a result, hypotheses 1 and 2 ''capture the main linguistic characteristics of language attrition''&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* 3. Critical period: at or around age 9. As a child grows, he becomes less able to master native-like abilities. Furthermore, various linguistic features (for example phonology or syntax) may have different stages or age limits for mastering. Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Viberg | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = Progression &amp; Regression in Language: sociocultural, neuropsychological, &amp; linguistic perspectives | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511627781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire "native-like-ness", but that there is no cut-off point in particular. Furthermore, they discuss a number of cases where a native-like L2 was acquired during adulthood.
* 4. Affect: motivation and attitude.

According to Yoshitomi,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; the five key aspects related to attrition are [[neuroplasticity]], consolidation, [[permastore]]/savings, decreased accessibility, and receptive versus productive abilities.

=== The regression hypothesis ===
The regression hypothesis, first formulated by Roman Jakobson in 1941 and originally formulated on the phonology of only Slavic languages,&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7i8ZLfGKcjcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=de+Bot,+K.+%26+B.+Weltens+(1991).+Recapitulation,+regression,+and+language+loss.+In+SELIGER+%26+VAGO+(eds),+31-51.&amp;ots=vX7Qy11wyl&amp;sig=Oe1D7OsTmyLCi7QLBl-cesHMuLE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false De Bot (1991)] De Bot, K., &amp; Weltens, B. (1991). Recapitulation, regression, and language loss. First language attrition, 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; goes back to the beginnings of psychology and psychoanalysis. It states that that which was learned first will be retained last, both in 'normal' processes of forgetting and in pathological conditions such as aphasia or dementia.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; As a template for language attrition, the regression hypothesis has long seemed an attractive paradigm. However, regression is not in itself a theoretical or explanatory framework.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Last in first out?: An investigation of the regression hypothesis in Dutch emigrants in Anglophone Canada | url = | journal = Toegepaste Taalwetenschap in Artikelen | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 131–139 | doi=10.1075/ttwia.78.12kei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both order of acquisition and order of attrition need to be put into the larger context of linguistic theory in order to gain explanatory adequacy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2010 | title = The regression hypothesis as a framework for first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 9–18 | doi=10.1017/s1366728909990356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keijzer (2007) conducted a study on the attrition of Dutch in Anglophone Canada. She finds some evidence that later-learned rules, such as diminutive and plural formation, indeed erode before earlier learned grammatical rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, there is also considerable interaction between the first and second language and so a straightforward 'regression pattern' cannot be observed.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Also, parallels in noun and verb phrase morphology could be present because of the nature of the tests or because of avoidance by the participants.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In a follow up 2010 article, Keijzer suggests that the regression hypothesis may be more applicable to morphology than to syntax.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Citing the studies on the regression hypothesis that have been done, Yukawa&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; says that the results have been contradictory. It is possible that attrition is a case-by-case situation depending on a number of variables (age, proficiency,&amp; [[literacy]], the similarities between the L1 and L2, and whether the L1 or the L2 is attriting). The [[threshold hypothesis]] states that there may be a level of proficiency that once attained, enables the attriting language to remain stable.

Children are more susceptible to (first) language attrition than adults.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Research shows an age effect around the ages of 8 through 13.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before this time period, a first language can attrite under certain circumstances, the most prominent being a sudden decline in exposure to the first language. Various case studies show that children who emigrate before puberty and have little to no exposure to their first language end up losing the first language. In 2009, a study compared two groups of Swedish-speaking groups: native Swedish speakers and Korean international adoptees who were at risk for losing their Korean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Bylund | first2 = E. | last3 = Abrahamsson | first3 = N. | last4 = Park | first4 = H. S. | year = 2009 | title = Dominant-language replacement: The case of international adoptees | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 121–140 | doi=10.1017/s1366728908004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Korean adoptees, those who were adopted the earliest essentially lost their Korean and those adopted later still retained some of it, although it was primarily their comprehension of Korean that was spared.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2007 study looked at Korean adoptees in France and found that they performed on par with native French speakers in French proficiency and Korean.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1615/ab35ebe2c40dfbb5463b3e1a66b67a6c3563.pdf Pallier 2007] Pallier, C. (2007). Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition. Language attrition: Theoretical perspectives, 155-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attrition of a first language does not guarantee an advantage in learning a second language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attriters are outperformed by native speakers of the second language in proficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2009 study tested the Swedish proficiency of Swedish speakers who had attrited knowledge of Spanish. These participants did show almost but not quite native-like proficiency when compared to native Swedish speakers, and they did not show an advantage when compared with bilingual Swedish-Spanish speakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the other hand, L1 attrition may also occur if the overall effort to maintain the first language is insufficient while exposed to a dominant L2 environment. Another recent investigation, focussing on the development of language in late bilinguals (i.e. adults past puberty), has claimed that maintenance of the mother tongue in an L1 environment requires little to no maintenance for individuals, whereas those in the L2 environment have an additive requirement for the maintenance of the L1 and the development of the L2 (Optiz, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opitz|first=Conny|date=2013-12-01|title=A dynamic perspective on late bilinguals' linguistic development in an L2 environment|url=http://ijb.sagepub.com/content/17/6/701|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=701–715|doi=10.1177/1367006912454621|issn=1367-0069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

there have been cases in which adults have undergone first language attrition. A 2011 study tested adult monolingual English speakers, adult monolingual Russian speakers and adult bilingual English-Russian speakers on naming various liquid containers (cup, glass, mug, etc.) in both English and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|last2=Malt|first2=Barbara C.|date=2011|title=Kitchen Russian: Cross-linguistic differences and first-language object naming by Russian-English bilinguals|url=|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=14|pages=19–45|doi=10.1017/s136672891000026x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that the bilinguals had attrited Russian vocabulary because they did not label these liquid containers the same way as the monolingual Russian speakers. When grouped according to Age of Acquisition (AoA) of English, the bilinguals showed an effect of AoA (or perhaps length of exposure to the L2) in that bilinguals with earlier AoA (mean AoA 3.4 years) exhibited much stronger attrition than bilinguals with later AoA (mean AoA 22.8 years). That is, the individuals with earlier AoA were the more different from monolingual Russian speakers in their labeling and categorization of drinking vessels, than the people with later AoA. However, even the late AoA bilinguals exhibited some degree of attrition in that they labeled the drinking vessels differently from native monolingual Russian-speaking adults.

==== Critical period hypothesis ====
Given that exposure to an L2 at a younger age typically leads to stronger attrition of the L1 than L2 exposure at later ages, there may be a relationship between language attrition and the [[critical period hypothesis]]. The critical period for language claims that there is an optimal time period for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research shows that the complete attrition of a language would occur before the critical period ends.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All available evidence on the age effect for L1 attrition therefore indicates that the development of susceptibility displays a curved, not a linear, function. This suggests that in native language learning there is indeed a Critical Period effect, and that full development of native language capacities necessitates exposure to L1 input for the entire duration of this CP.

====L2 attrition====

In Hansen &amp; Reetz-Kurashige (1999), Hansen cites her own research on L2-Hindi and Urdu attrition in young children. As young pre-school children in India and Pakistan, the subjects of her study were often judged to be native speakers of Hindi or Urdu; their mother was far less proficient. On return visits to their home country, the United States, both children appeared to lose all their L2 while the mother noticed no decline in her own L2 abilities. Twenty years later, those same young children as adults ''comprehend not a word from recordings of their own animated conversations in Hindi-Urdu; the mother still understands much of them''.

Yamamoto (2001) found a link between age and bilinguality. In fact, a number of factors are at play in bilingual families. In her study, bicultural families that maintained only one language, the minority language, in the household, were able to raise bilingual, bicultural children without fail. Families that adopted the one parent – one language policy were able to raise bilingual children at first but when the children joined the dominant language school system, there was a 50% chance that children would lose their minority language abilities. In families that had more than one child, the older child was most likely to retain two languages, if it was at all possible. Younger siblings in families with more than two other brothers and sisters had little chance of maintaining or ever becoming bilingual.

=== Age of arrival ===
There are few principled and systematic investigations of FLA specifically investigating the impact of AoA. However, converging evidence suggests an age effect on FLA which is much stronger and more clearly delineated than the effects that have been found in SLA research. Two studies that consider prepuberty and postpuberty migrants (Ammerlaan, 1996, AoA 0–29 yrs; Pelc, 2001, AoA 8–32 years) find that AoA is one of the most important predictors of ultimate proficiency, and a number of studies that investigate the impact of age among postpuberty migrants fail to find any effect at all (Köpke, 1999, AoA 14–36 yrs; Schmid, 2002, AoA 12–29 yrs; Schmid, 2007, AoA 17–51 yrs). A range of studies conducted by Montrul on Spanish heritage speakers in the US as well as Spanish-English bilinguals with varying levels of AoA also suggests that the L1 system of early bilinguals may be similar to that of L2 speakers, while later learners pattern with monolinguals in their L1 (e.g. Montrul, 2008; Montrul, 2009). These findings therefore indicate strongly that early (prepuberty) and late (postpuberty) exposure to an L2 environment have a different impact on possible fossilization and/or deterioration of the linguistic system.

===Frequency of use===
Frequency of use has been shown to be an important factor in language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosody and Language in Contact: L2 Acquisition, Attrition and Languages in Multilingual Situations|last=Yeh|first=Chia-Hsin|last2=Lin|first2=Yen-Hwei|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=194|chapter=Chapter 10: Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in use of a given language leads to gradual loss of that language.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First language attrition|last=Seliger|first=Herbert L.|last2=Vago|first2=Robert M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Interfaces: Second language acquisition and first language attrition of Spanish subject realization and word order variation|last=Domínguez|first=Laura|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2013|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of much evidence to the contrary, one study is often cited to suggest that frequency of use does not correlate strongly with language attrition.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254809520_Social_Determinants_of_Language_Loss|title=Social Determinants of Language Loss|last=Jaspaert|first=Koen|last2=Kroon|first2=S.|date=January 1989|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their methodology, however, can be called into question, especially concerning the small sample size and the reliance on self reported data.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Language Attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues|last=Köpke|first=Barbara|last2=Schmid|first2=Monika S.|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2004|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers themselves state that their findings may be inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The overall evidence suggests that frequency of use is a strong indicator of language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===Motivation===
Motivation could be defined as the willingness and desire to learn a second language, or, in the case of attrition, the incentive to maintain a language.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Archibald|first=John|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation can be split into four categories,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academypublication.com/issues/past/tpls/vol01/06/12.pdf|title=The Interrelationship of Instrumental, Integrative, Intrinsic, and Extrinsic Motivations and the Lexical-oriented Knowledge among Persian EFL Language Learners|last=Soureshjani|first=Kamal Heidari|last2=Naseri|first2=Noushin|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often simply split into two distinct forms: the instrumental and the integrative.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Instrumental motivation, in the case of attrition, is the desire to maintain a language in order to complete a specific goal, i.e. maintaining a language to maintain a job. Integrative motivation, however, is motivation that comes from a desire to fit in or maintain one's cultural ties.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; These inferences can be drawn, as strategies for knowledge maintenance will, by definition, precisely oppose actions that lead to forgetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227983368_The_Handbook_of_Applied_Linguistics|title=Language attrition|last=Schmid|first=Monika S.|last2=de Bot|first2=Kees|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences in attrition related to motivation depending on the type at hand. Instrumental motivation is often less potent than integrative motivation, but, given sufficient incentives, it can be equally as powerful.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A 1972 study by Gardner and Lambert emphasized the importance of integrative motivation in particular in regards to factors relating to language acquisition, and, by extension, language attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281000889X|title=Attitude, motivation, and difficulties involved in learning the English language and factors that affect motivation in learning it|last=Al Rifai|first=Nada|date=2010|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.849|volume=2|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=5216–5227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AACSB Accredited.svg|thumbnail|Logo of accredited schools]]
There are 182 schools that hold the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business's]] (AACSB) [[Accounting]] [[Accreditation]]. The AACSB accredits [[business school]]s by evaluating critical areas of each school to ensure that it provides top-quality education,&lt;ref name="AACSB Accreditation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/aacsb.asp|publisher=AACSB International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and schools can apply for the [[accounting]] accreditation, which focusses on the schools' accounting programs, in addition to business accreditation.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/|publisher=AACSB International|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation is gained and maintained via a peer-review system, and schools are assessed in the context of their respective missions rather than against a fixed standard.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=B-School Accrediting Body Retools Standards|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323820304578411071717286236|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To apply for accounting accreditation, a school is required either to already hold the business accreditation, or to apply for both the business and accounting accreditations at the same time.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt;

The initial accounting accreditation process starts with the submission of an eligibility application, and includes self-evaluations and peer reviews.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt; The business school and the accounting academic unit are evaluated on their alignment with the AACSB's accreditation standards; under the standard for accounting accreditation, an accounting academic unit is evaluated based on its mission, intellectual contributions, and financial strategies for achieving its mission. For example, one of the bases of evaluation is whether the academic unit has produced intellectual contributions that have affected [[accounting]], [[business]] and [[management]] "in ways that are consistent with the mission, expected outcomes, and strategies of the unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation Standards for Accounting Accreditation |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108093650/http://aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the accounting accreditation is extended via 5-year review cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook For Joint Business And Accounting Continuous Improvement Reviews |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175301/http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the AACSB estimated that 5% of all business programs internationally, and most top business programs in the [[United States]], held AACSB accreditation.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013" /&gt; AACSB accreditation is seen as a standard requirement in graduate business education, and universities are more likely to accept [[transfer credit]] earned from accredited schools;&lt;ref name="HK 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilpert|first=Ditmar|author2=Thomas Kern |title=Success Factors of American Business Schools or "How Business Schools Attract Promising Students"|journal=Applied Marketing|year=2003|pages=995–1012|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18981-4_87|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has been called "the hallmark of excellence in business education".&lt;ref name=SMU&gt;{{cite web|title=SMU is one of the youngest universities to receive accreditation from oldest global accrediting body AACSB International|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/news/2011/04/11/smu-one-youngest-universities-receive-accreditation-oldest-global-accrediting-body|publisher=Singapore Management University|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippine President [[Ramon Magsaysay]] created the Castro Committee on October 1954 to investigate the death. The eponymous committee was headed by [[Executive Secretary (Philippines)|Executive Secretary]] [[Fred Ruiz Castro]] joined by UP faculty members Arturo Garcia and V. Lontok. It submitted a 116-page report to Magsaysay find hazing to be the cause of Albert's death and also recommended the expulsion of 4 officers of Upsilon, suspension of 25 members for one year, suspension of 19 neophytes for a semester, and a reprimand the reprimand of 3 other members. It also called for reforms on university regulation on fraternities and sororities and the prohibition of all forms of physical initiation.

'''May Lucretia Shepard Cheney''' (May 11, 1862 – April 22, 1942) was born during the Civil War in Garden Grove, Iowa, and was named after the month in which she was born, and her maternal grandmother who influenced her childhood. May's early school attendance was in her hometown. She attended high schools in Oakland and Chico, California before enrolling at [[University of California, Berkeley|UCB]] in 1879. With her widowed mother, she settled at ''2020 Hearst Avenue'' (then ''College Way''), in a house with a watermill in the rear yard.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/cheney.html| title=U.C. offers the American Turgenev’s house for one dollar| work=[[Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residing in the same house was [[Lemuel Warren Cheney]] (1858–1921), a law student.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;

The following year, the Shepards moved to 2316 Allston Way, across the street from the campus. Before long, Cheney had moved there too. The Shepards’ last address before May’s graduation in 1883 was Club House No. 4 on the university grounds, again shared by Cheney, now a journalist. In addition to their shared living quarters, May and Lemuel had a common interest in literature. Both belonged to the Neolaean Literary Society, of which May was vice-president.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/studentpubs.html| title=Berkeley: Student Publications| work=[[University of California, Berkeley Libraries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1883, during her senior year, she married Cheney, the Bachelor of Letters degree was granted to her in December of that year. They left for Europe, where he served as [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] correspondent for the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]. Their first son, Charles Henry Cheney, was born in Rome in February 1884. Upon their return she and her husband had a house built close to UCB, on College Avenue in [[Lodi, California|Lodi]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

In 1886, when she was 24 years old, May founded Cheney’s Pacific Coast Bureau of Education in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. It was the first commercial teacher placement agency west of the Rockies, and her husband participated in its management. She decided that UCB owed some obligation to the graduates unable to find proper positions. The English universities had appointment secretaries. Harvard University had a similar official. UCB, she thought, should likewise give such a service to students. After she convinced UCB President [[Martin Kellogg]], her plan was accepted. She opened the UCB placement service in the president's office in South Hall on January 1, 1898, and continued to serve as the university’s Appointment Secretary for 40 years, placing countless university graduates as high-school teachers throughout the state.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

The Cheneys raised four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood. The eldest, Charles Henry Cheney (1884–1943), earned the first architectural degree awarded by UC before continuing his studies in Paris, eventually becoming a notable city planner and zoning expert. His son, Warren DeWitt Cheney (1907-1979), was a well-known sculptor and art teacher who took up psychology in midlife, founding the Transactional Analysis Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.invaluable.com/artist/cheney-warren-dewitt-e1e1hbp3gx| title=Warren Dewitt Cheney (1907-1979)| work=Invaluable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheldon Warren Cheney]] (1886–1980), entered his father’s real estate business before moving to Detroit, where he became a notable author and art critic. In 1916 he founded [[Theatre Arts Magazine]]. Marshall Chipman Cheney (1888–1972) became a physician. He did his residency at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] before returning to Berkeley, where he practiced near the campus and at Cowell Memorial Hospital. He lived with his widowed mother at 2241 College Avenue until 1940.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

At the end of 1939, May Cheney sold her two campus houses to the university, and the family soon moved to 116 Tunnel Road. The two Cheney houses on campus were designated City of Berkeley Landmarks in 1990. Built in 1885, 2241 College Avenue is the second oldest surviving structure in the Berkeley Property Tract.

May L. Cheney was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the [[American College Personnel Association]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In choosing a permanent home we seek that place above all others which promises abundance of life, stimulus, interests that postpone as long as possible the inevitable apathy of old age. Where do we find this precious boon more abundantly than in Berkeley?&lt;ref&gt;May L. Cheney, ''Berkeley Reporter'', December 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheney unhurt in campus shooting==
On August 4, 1919, Cheney was shot at by Roger Sprague, a chemistry assistant who was despondent at not being recommended for further advancement. She escaped unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19190805.2.6| title=Refused Position, Man Attempts Life Of Two Professors| work=[[The Sacramento Union]], Volume 209, Number 36 (Sacramento, California)| date=5 August 1919| page=1| accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myanmar National Education Law''' ({{lang-my|အမျိုးသားပညာရေး ဥပဒေ}}), enacted on 30 September 2014, is designed to reform the country's outdated education system. Drafted in March 2014, the bill was passed after being sent back to the floor by [[President of Burma|President]] [[Thein Sein]] with 25 proposed changes, 19 of which were accepted. From the beginning of its drafting process, the law faced criticism from students and teachers unions as well as various civil society groups. Concerns over the law later turned into protests, which were eventually cracked down by the [[Government of Burma|government]].

==National Education Law 2014==

'''Section 1''' includes definition of terms used in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=1–5|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As laid out in '''Section 2''', the main objectives of the law are to train students to become critical thinkers; to nurture students to become law-abiding citizens with democratic principles; to enable students to become citizens who could pass down their ethnic languages, traditions, literature and to value historical heritage and environmental sustainability; to enhance human resources in preparation for economic development and higher standards of living; to provide a learning environment that is up to date with international standards and to improve teaching, learning and research by using technology information and communication information; to help students excel in their own fields of interest; and to promote sportsmanship and school health projects.&lt;ref name=NEL&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=5–6|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 3''' of the law covers the fundamental policies of the law that include providing education for students with disabilities; providing education relevant to the lives of the students; and granting autonomy of colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=6–7|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 4''' outlines the formation of National Education Commission that will consist of ministers from related sectors, experts from nationality groups and relevant individuals. The duties of the committee include providing guidelines on implementation of the objectives and the policies of the law; setting policies to ensure the quality of education; working with the government and local administration to get funding for the education sector; making policies regarding shutting down or opening of domestic as well as international schools; and working with relevant departments and ministries on short-term and long-term educational goals. Article 7 of the Section 4 also states that the commission should not interfere with the management of institutions of higher education but only assist with policy-related issues for their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=7–8|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 5''' states that public education will be divided into primary education, vocational education and higher education. The section also talks about formal and informal education as well as self-learning education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=9–12|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 6''' covers the different types of schools that include public schools, private schools, monastic schools, volunteer schools, regional schools, government-funded schools, special schools and emergency mobile schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=12–13|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 7''' is about curriculum and it states that National Education Commission has to ensure curriculums used in the country have boundaries and standards and guarantee autonomy of curriculum formations if it meets these standards. Ministry of Education will set the standards of National Education Curriculum with approval from the Commission. Schools can teach in either Burmese or English or both languages and if necessary, an ethnic language and Burmese can be used in primary education. It also mentions that in States and Regions, ethnic language and literature program can be implemented through state and regional governments starting from elementary level and upgraded step by step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=13–15|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 8''' details educational duties and benefits and explain the roles of parent(s) or guardian(s) and local and regional administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=15–16|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 9''' focuses on requirements for and quality of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=16–17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 10''' covers monitoring and accessing the education quality and states that in every level of education there must be a quality assessment scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 11''' is on management and administrative duties of education. In Article 56 (a), it states the Ministry of Education, relevant ministries and Higher Education Committee will work together to manage related institutions of higher education based on this law and existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17–19|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 12''' covers budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=19–20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Section 13''', Article 66 states that existing schools before the implementation of the law must operate according to the law by five years of its enactment.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 covers more general issues including that the law does not govern schools that only teach religion.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"/&gt;

==Background==
In March 2014, Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC) drafted the National Education Bill,&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma's Teachers Chime in on Education Reform|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burmas-teachers-chime-in-on-education-reform-burma-myanmar/44176|accessdate=21 February 2015|publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went through both houses of [[Hluttaw]] on July 30, 2014.&lt;ref name="myanmar teachers' fed decry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yen|first1=Snaing|title=Myanmar Teachers' Federation Decry Lack of Consulatation|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-federation-decries-lack-consultation-burmas-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was waiting for the approval from President, students and teachers unions as well as the civil society groups raised concerns over whether the bill was drafted democratically . They claimed that even though the government held meetings to seek advice from the public, it ignored their recommendations.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aung|first1=San Yamin|title=Teachers' and Students' Organizations Join Up to Oppose Education Bill|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-students-organizations-join-oppose-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thein Sein sent back the bill to the parliament with some 25 proposed changes.  On September 26, the parliament accepted 19 of the proposed changes but denied 6 one of which is to delay the full implementation of the law to 2027&lt;ref name="students vow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lwin|first1=Sithu|last2=Zaw|first2=Mg|title=Student unions vow to continue protests against education law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became enacted on September 30. The next step is for Hluttaw to pass by-laws in the coming months to supplement the enacted law.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Seek Four-Party Dialogue on Education Law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Opponents of the law claimed that the government didn't seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; They also stated that under the new law, universities would not be independent from [[Ministry of Education (Burma)|Ministry of Education]]&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Min|first1=Myat|title=Myanmar students to hold emergency meeting over education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/13614-myanmar-students-to- hold-emergency-meeting-over-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of all, they point out that the law will not recognize the formation of student and teacher unions.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt;

On the other hand, members of Hluttaw responded that institutions of higher education would remain independent from central control. Khin Maung Yi, the secretary of the Joint Bill Committee, asserted that universities would have autonomy over creating their own policies. He also accused that protesters had "little understanding" of law.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; [[Yin Yin Nwe]], a member of the President Education Advisory Group, remarked that complete decentralization of education would be impossible. The advisory group also stated that government committees that would be established as mentioned in the law were not designed to control universities but just to allocate budget.&lt;ref name="limits to how far"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myint|first1=Nan|title=Limits to how far universities could be decentralized: gov't advisors|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/15009-limits-to-how-far- universities- could-be-decentralized-govt-advisers|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|issue=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National League for Democracy]], the main opposition party led by [[Aung San Su Kyi]], was rather silent on the issue. In fact, the party distanced itself from the student protests stating explicitly that they would not follow National Network for Education Reform and did not endorse its criticism of the law (behind the student protests). Moreover, [[Phyo Min Thein]], one the NLD's [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] Representatives, said that the current law was "practical" given the political constraints.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lone|first1=Wa|title=Behind the student protests|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/in-depth/12359-behind-the-student-protests.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Opponents of the Law===

====National Network for Education Reform====
NNER is one of the most vocal opponents of the national education bill since its drafting stage. It is a coalition of civil society groups that include student unions, teacher unions, ethnic education groups, faith-based education groups, disabled education groups, community-based education groups, alternative education groups, education branches of political organisations, scholars and interested persons. It was formed in 2012 and had held several discussions across the country to seek opinions from the public on the current education reform process and in June 2013, it held a nationwide conference, attended by 1200 participants.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt; During the drafting process of national education bill, NNER met with several government representatives and was even invited to meetings held in [[Naypyidaw]]. However, later it was left out from the discussion on the crafting of the bill.&lt;ref name="consider nothing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title='I Consider Nothing to Have Changed'|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/consider-nothing-changed.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student and Teacher Unions====
The two most eminent student unions involved in opposing the education law are [[All Burma Federation of Student Unions]] and Confederation of University Student Unions and Middle Myanmar Student Unions. These organizations are also the major force behind the student protests against the law.

MTF (Myanmar Teachers Federation), a nationwide teacher union, is also one of the major opponents of the bill. It released a statement on September 15, 2014 to publicly assert their position on the issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would like to announce to the people that we strongly believe that the National Education Law will affect not only the education sector but [also] the entire country and the people.  Therefore, the Myanmar Teachers Federation will fully cooperate with the student unions across the country who are pushing for the education reform that will benefit the country.&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

In the same statement, MTF also criticized the government for investigating the students' protests against the law and called for the drop of criminal charges.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt;

==Student Protests==

===''Initial Protest: May 2014 - Sept 2014''===
The earliest protests against the National Education Law came even before the passage of the bill. In [[Mandalay Region]], students at colleges and universities had held ongoing protests since May 2014. The protests were, however, postponed in early September due to upcoming exams but the students continued holding public talks to voice why they opposed the bill.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt; Initially, protesters also linked their campaigns against the bill to the arrest of an ABFSU member, Phyu Hnin Htwe, charged for allegedly kidnapping two Chinese workers from [[Letpadaung Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; Government authorities also initiated criminal investigations against these protests based on the ground that they were held without prior government approval.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt;

===''Emergency Student Meeting: October – 13 Nov 2014''===

On 4 October 2014, three days after the law was enacted, an organizing committee was formed composed of 10 members of ABFSU and 10 members of CUSU. On 10 October, ABFSU announced that they would be holding an emergency meeting with student representatives from across the country in November.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; The plan was to have a two-day meeting to discuss about the National Education Law on the first day and then make plans on how to proceed on the next day.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; Later, the meeting was held in Yangon from November 12 to 13, which concluded with the formation of Action Committee for Democratic Education - 15-person group that consists of members of ABFSU, CUSU and MMSU - in charge of planning the four-day protest in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Protest Education Law in Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-downtown-rangoon.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Four-Day March: Nov 14–17 2014''===
[[File:Myanmar National Education Law Protests 1.jpg|thumb|Students protests at Yangon University]]
On November 14, about 350 students gathered in front of [[Maha Bandula Park]] in downtown [[Yangon]] to stage a protest against the National Education Law.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students also later held subsequent protests at [[Yangon University]] and [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest was just the beginning of the fight to reform National Education Law.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students' opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The protest also coincided with [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s second visit to [[Yangon]] although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students' concerns.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn't respond within the deadline.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt;

===''60 day Ultimatum: Nov 18, 20 14– Jan 20, 2015''===

On November 18, a day after the students announced an ultimatum, Ministry of Education held a press conference, urging the students to attend a negotiating meeting with Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC), which drafted the legislation.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt; At the conference, Khin San Yee, the Minister of Education, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want them to negotiate freely and transparently. Every parent cannot fulfill all of the demands of their children. So think of us like the parents and demand and negotiate with us and we will do. But if the parents can't afford it, the children should understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 20, President's Education Advisory Group held a meeting at the Diamond Jubliee Hall at Yangon University, to assert their stance on the current controversy over National Education Law. While acknowledging the voice of the students on the importance of decentralization of education, the group claims that there are limits to how independent universities could be. It further claims that the formation of National Education Committee is the solely on the purpose of budget allocation but not to centralize control over institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt;

Zaw Htay, the Director General of [[Higher Education in Burma|Higher Education]] Department (Lower Myanmar) stated that negotiations were still open, after the students rejected a meeting with the ministry. He also said that students, parents and experts would be consulted in the process of crafting by-laws&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; [[Shwe Mann]], the speaker of [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]], also agreed to accept written submissions to the parliament while EPIC also offered to serve as an intermediary.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students, however, announced that they had no intention to write submissions to the parliament because they were waiting for the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students to Protest Education Law in Mandalay|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-mandalay.html|accessdate=26 November 2014|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, the Action Committee for Democratic Education announced that they were planning a seminar on National Education Law in mid-December and would invite experts unaffiliated with the government or the protesters. They also had plans to stage two more protests in the upcoming week and had held three in the previous week.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay" /&gt;

On November 27, about fifty students from [[Mandalay]], [[Sagaing]], [[Monywa]] and [[Myingyan]] staged an unauthorized protest in front of City Hall in Mandalay to reiterate their demand: to convene a quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=Government Neglecting Student Demands Mandalay Protesters Say|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-neglecting-student-demands-mandalay-protestors- say.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Myanmar Police Force|police]] at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers' children themselves would benefit from the protests and were able to march to the City Hall and ended their protest at [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]], a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect" /&gt;

On December 1, six students were threatened to get arrested for unauthorized protests that took place on November 29. They were told that they would be arrested for a day and then be eligible to be bailed out.&lt;ref name="6 students face"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=6 Students to Face Charge|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/6-students-face-charges-education-protest.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police left to inform the superiors and never returned after the students told them that they would not accept the release on bail but would rather get arrested.&lt;ref name="6 students face" /&gt; The six accused students, also the members of ABFSU, waited at [[Taungoo]] train station until 10 pm for the police to show up but then left.&lt;ref name="6 students face" /&gt;

On December 12, the Ministry of Education formed a teacher union consisting of two teachers from each department of Yangon [[University of Foreign Languages, Yangon|University of Foreign Languages]]. Myanmar Teachers Federation promptly rejected the ministry's attempt to form a union stating that it violated the internationally accepted principles of freedom of association.&lt;ref name="teacher rejects ministry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snaing|first1=Yen|title=Teacher Federation Rejects Ministry Plans for Official Union|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-federation-rejects-ministry-plans-official- unions.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement released by MTF also said that the ministry failed to recognize MTF even though Burma had agreed to adhere to 1955 International Labor convention that guaranteed the formation of union and the right to organize and despite MTF's compliance with the current Burma's labor draft law.&lt;ref name="teacher rejects ministry" /&gt;

===''The 404-Mile March: Jan 16 – Jan 31 2015''===

After the 60-day ultimatum to convene a quadripartite expired on Jan 16, students from far afield as [[Pakokku]], [[Sagaing]] and [[Monywa]] set out to join the march from Mandalay to Yangon.&lt;ref name="students resume protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=Students Resume Protests Against National Education Law|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-resume-protests-national-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing House|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Jan 20, more than a hundred students left Mandalay as the march began.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; The students also had plans to join other student protesters on their 404-mile journey to Yangon that they were planning to finish in 15 days.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; They also said that they would set up a camp after arriving in Yangon to urge the government to consult with students and teachers on future amendments to the law.&lt;ref name="students resume protests" /&gt; 
Immediately after the march began, President [[Thein Sein]], announced in a state-run newspaper on Jan 21 that the parliament should reconsider some parts of the National Education Law and said that amendments would lead to stability and allow the students to resume their studies.&lt;ref name="prez urge"&gt;{{cite news|title=President urges education law rethink in face Mandalay March|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/17066-president-urges-%20education-law-%20rethink-in-face-mandalay-march|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Mizzima|date=21 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, in a statement released by the parliament mentioned that it had agreed to consider changing the National Education Law and ordered the Ministry of Education to urgently come up with a draft that would incorporate inputs from both houses of the parliament, related government committees and commissions as well as relevant individuals.&lt;ref name="parliament presses"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Parliament Presses President on Six-Party Talks, Agrees to Revisit Education Law|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/parliament-presses-president-six-party-talks-agrees-revisit-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, ACDE released a statement that outlined the 11 issues that the students wanted to discuss at the quadripartite meeting:

:#Inclusion of representatives of teachers and students in legislation process of education policies and laws, by-laws and other related laws, 
:#The right to freely establish and operate student and teacher unions and legal recognition for them, 
:#Establishment of National Education Commission and University Coordination Committee mentioned in the approved National Education Law

On January 28, the student representatives and the government had a meeting in Naypyidaw – attended by ten student representatives, two members of parliament and Minister Aung Min as well as Deputy Education Minister Thant Shin.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt;  The government and the student leaders then released a joint statement announcing that they had agreed to stop the march to Yangon after the quadripartite meeting which would be held at the Diamond Jubilee Hall at [[Yangon University]] on February 1.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; The statement also said that 11 demand-points from the students would also be discussed at the meeting on February 1. Meanwhile, the students declared that until they met with their representatives who went to Naypyidaw for the meeting, they would still continue the march.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; On the other hand, the protesters in [[Pakokku]] and [[Dawei]] who were planning to join the march suspended their plans.&lt;ref name="students march on"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students march on, as talk date is agreed over Myanmar's education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Mizzima News|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Quadripartite Meetings: Feb 1–14, 2015''===

On February 1 as the quadripartite meeting was taking place, the NLD publicly announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member and the chairman of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt; It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. [[Han Tha Myint]], a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party's stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="NLD distances"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mon|first1=Kyaw Su|title=NLD Distances Itself from Leading Voice on Education|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/nld-distances-leading-voice-education.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt;

The first quadripartite meeting ended with the students reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators.&lt;ref name="protests continue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Protests Continue as Students, Govt Discuss Education Reform|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/protests-continue-students-govt-discuss-education-reform.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aung Min]], a [[Office of the President of Burma|President's Office]] Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president the responsibility of the students' safety until they arrived in [[Mount Popa|Popa]] in [[Mandalay Region]].&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt;

On February 3, in front of Ministry of Education headquarter in [[Naypyidaw]], the students announced that they would be resuming their nationwide protests.&lt;ref name="students vow action"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gyi|first1=Aung|title=Students vow action after govt delays talks|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-vow-action-after-govt-delays-talks-burma-myanmar/47968|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president's advice after a discussion.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; That early afternoon, the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]] released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; On the same day, [[Aung San Su Kyi]] confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER.&lt;ref name="NLD resign" /&gt; Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.&lt;ref name="NLD resign"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Soe Than|title=NLD committee member must resign or cease education activism, says Suu Kyi|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17456-nld-committee-member-%20must-%20resign-or-cease-education-activism-says-suu-kyi|agency=Mizzima News|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, the student demonstrators from [[Ayeyarwady Region]] have arrived near [[Kyaunggon]] after they received a welcoming reception from the town residents. About 800 people also temporarily joined the students marching from Mandalay on their way to [[Taungdwingyi]] after the leaders gave a speech at [[Magway University|Magwe]] Computer University. The students also planned to stay and protest in [[Pakokku]] for three days starting February 5 before they resumed their march to Yangon. At the same time, a committee representing about 260 civil society groups released a statement urging the government to continue quadripartite meetings and to refrain from the use of violence against student protestors.&lt;ref name="govt postpones"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=After Govt Postpones Education Talks, Students Continue March to Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-postpones-education-talks-students-continue-march-rangoon.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, it was confirmed that students from Ayeyarwady Region and [[Taninthayi Region]] had continued marching to Yangon to join other protesters.  That same day, the government announced that some political organization with intentions to destabilize the country were behind the student protests even though it did not identify them. It further urged the public to remind themselves of riots resulting in instability in the past.&lt;ref name="student rejects"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma Students Reject Govt Warning to Stop Protests|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burma-students-reject-govt-warning-stop-protests.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, [[Ko Ko (minister)|Ko Ko]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Burma)|Minister for Home Affairs]], said in the interview that some political extremists were manipulating students to use methods of confrontation and that in some cases, most of them were supported by foreign organizations.&lt;ref name="students are puppets" /&gt; Ye Yint Kyaw, a member of the ACDE, retaliated by accusing the government of having the same mentality as the former military regime.&lt;ref name="students are puppets"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students are puppets, says minister|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-are-puppets-says-minister-national-education-law-burma-myanmar/48103|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fourth quadripartite meeting on February 14 went without any issues, the student leaders and NNER began to craft the proposed amendment bill, which they finished on February 15.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt;  and the bill was submitted to the parliament on February 16.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; Student groups from Ayeyarwady Region and [[Tanintharyi Region]] decided to suspend their march after hearing the result of the meeting. Student organizers also stated one of the reasons they decided to go back was because of [[Sitagu Sayadaw|Ashin Nyanisarra]], one of the most respected monks in [[Myanmar]], who told them to take pride in what they achieved and go back to continue their education for the future of the country.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; In another statement, Ashin Nyanisarra told the government to forgive the students and to accept their demands.&lt;ref name="southern students" /&gt; Meanwhile, the main group of protesters from Mandalay continued to march from [[Minla]] to Letpadan in Bago Region and planned to arrive in Yangon in ten days &lt;ref name="southern students"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Southern Student Protests Disband, as Mandalay Marchers Press Ahead|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/southern-student-protests-disband-mandalay- marchers-press- ahead.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite announcement by the government the day before that it would be taking legal actions against the protesters if they continued their march to Yangon.&lt;ref name="minister threatens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linn|first1=Soe Than|title=Minister threatens legal action against protest students|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17859-minister-threatens-legal-action-against-protest-students/17859-minister-threatens-legal-action-against-protest-students|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Mizzima News|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, the protesters from Ayeyarwaddy Region stalled their march and set up temporary camps in [[Maubin]] and [[Pathein]] Townships as they waited for the decision from the parliament while giving public talks on the latest updates on the agreements they had with the government and the content of the proposed amendment bill.&lt;ref name="ayeyarwaddy students build"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ayeyawady students build temporary protest camps|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9081:ayeyawady-students-build-temporary-protest-camps&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Union Nationalities Alliance announced that they were in support of the student protests and donated $1000 while at the same time urging the parliament to quickly pass the amendments.&lt;ref name="parlament urged"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament urged to speedily approve national education bill|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9087:parliament-urged-to-speedily-approve-national-education-bill&amp;catid=32&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some 30 students from [[Dagon University]] in Yangon staged a sit-in in front of the rector's office from 9:30 am to noon after they were unknowing invited to a campus event earlier that week that condemned the student protests.&lt;ref name="students stage sit-in"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Stage Sit-In at Dagon University|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-stage-sit-dagon-university.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sit-in was also a response to the article featured in [[Kyemon|The Mirror]], a state-owned newspaper that claimed that students had organized the event by themselves.&lt;ref name="students stage sit-in" /&gt;

On February 20, the main column of student protesters from Mandalay announced that they would take a break from marching until March 1 due to primary and middle school exams coming up at the end of February.&lt;ref name="marching students pause"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Marching Student Protesters Pause for Exams|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/marching-student-protestors-pause-exams.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students also stated that they wanted to give time to the parliament and see how it would handle the amendment bill.&lt;ref name="marching students pause" /&gt;

On February 22, at a press conference in Yangon, the students accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education's version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings.&lt;ref name="gov't violates"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students, NGOs Say Govt Violates Agreement on Education Law Overhaul|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-ngos-say-govt-violates-agreement-education-law-overhaul.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them.&lt;ref name="gov't violates" /&gt; The bill that the Ministry of Education proposed, according to Thein Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the quadripartite meeting but agreed to be discarded by the government.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thu|first1=Mrat Kyaw|title=Students meet speaker as MPs ready for debate|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/13249-dispute-erupts-over-competing-education-law-amendment-bills.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min Thein, a member of parliament representing the NLD.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker" /&gt;  Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years.&lt;ref name="students meet speaker" /&gt;

Meanwhile, on February 24, the [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (the Upper House) invited six major groups of stakeholders - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant members of the public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on the current issue to attend public hearings between March 5 – 15.&lt;ref name="parliament invites"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Parliament invites students for Edu Law briefing|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/parliament-invites-students-for-edu-law-briefing-burma-myanmar/48695|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Media Group|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the [[State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee]] (SSMNC) – a body of government-appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma – issued a statement to the parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="NSC rejects"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=National Sangha Committee Rejects Education Reform Demands|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/national-sangha-committee-rejects-education-reform-demands.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), "schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law".&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt; Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill.&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt;

On February 25, in response to the accusation from the students, Khin Maung Yi, the chairperson of Joint Bill Committee, stated that the committee was not just buying time.&lt;ref name="bill committee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill committee: Education law amendment will not meet student deadline|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9153:bill-committee-education-law-amendment-will-not-meet-student-deadline&amp;catid=32:politics&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the budget bill, the taxation bill and the national planning bill.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt; Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt;

On February 27, the students met with Shwe Mann, the Speaker of the [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]] and the Joint Bill Committee to voice their concerns over the competing bills but they were told that the bills were already submitted to the parliament.&lt;ref name="students cry foul"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Cry Foul Over Education Ministry Proposals|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-cry-foul-education-ministry-proposals.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanda Sit Aung, member of the ACDE, said that it was the violation of the quadripartite agreements because the bill that was submitted as the one proposed by students and the NNER was actually the one that everyone agreed at the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="students cry foul" /&gt;
 
On March 2, as the students prepared to resume their march to Yangon from [[Letpadan Township|Letpadan]], the police surrounded the monastery where they were staying.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar Prevents Students From Marching Against Academic Law|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/myanmar-prevents-student-protesters-marching-yangon-29316968|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABC News|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students then agreed to delay their march and were joined by another group of students that pushed through a barricade of riot police.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents" /&gt;

On March 3, a confrontation broke out between the student protesters and the police when a group of female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike.&lt;ref name="students face off"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Students face off against police in Letpadan|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-face-off-aginst-police-in-letpadan-burma-myanmar/48884|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col.

On March 4, the students woke up to find that the government had reinforced the blockade with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="tension sparks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letpadan tension sparks return to nationwide education protests|url=https://www.dvb.no/dvb-video/letpadan-tension-sparks-return-nationwide-education-protests/48943|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot police also stopped a group of student protesters who left [Pyay] to join the students in Letpadan.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; The truck the students were on was checked on its way to Letpadan and was not allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; A police officer said that they were ordered to stop the protesters and that the students should wait for the results of the negotiation scheduled for the next day.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; Police Lt.

On March 5, the student representatives boycotted the parliamentary hearings due to police blockade of the protesters in Letpadan.&lt;ref name="students exit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar students exit education bill hearing in solidarity with protesters|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20150305095639-djaos/|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thomas Reuters Foundation|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, the protest staged right outside of [[Yangon City Hall]] to show solidarity with the student protesters in Letpadan was cracked down by the riot police and civilians with "duty" armbands.&lt;ref name="police charge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amarasinghe|first1=Gemunu|title=Myanmar police charge at student protesters with batons|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_MYANMAR_PROTEST_CRACKDOWN?SI|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABQ Journal|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were in total about fifty protesters and eight people were arrested - five students and three members from 88 Generation Peace and Open Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police coral student protesters|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/18405-police-coral-student-|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Agence France‑Presse|publisher=Mizzima News|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of detaining them in a police station, they were taken to the former office of Ministry of Agriculture in [[Yankin Township]].&lt;ref name="students activist alleged"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students, Activists Allege Violence in Rangoon Protest Crackdown|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-activists-allege-violence-in-rangoon-protest-crackdown.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, all eight students were released but they were charged under Article 18 of Peaceful Assembly Law for organizing unlawful protest, which could result in up to one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; The same morning, another five student protesters near the town market in Letpadan were arrested and the Letpadan local police also announced that 11 people present at a rally two days earlier would  be charged under the same article used to arrest protesters in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; There were also two rallies that day, one near the Yangon University campus and one at the entrance of Mandalay University campus to criticize the government's violent crackdown of the protests a day earlier in Yangon and to urge the government to let the students continue their march from Letpadan.&lt;ref name="rallies in ygn and man"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rallies in Rangoon, Mandalay to Condemn Police Crackdown|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia-burma/rallies-in-rangoon-mandalay-to-condemn-police-crackdown.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, the students after going a hunger strike since March 3 announced the deadline at 10 am on March 10, asking the government to bring an end to the standoff in Letpadan and to allow them to continue marching to Yangon.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scenes of Indiscriminate Violence in Letpadan as Police Attack Ambulance Workers, Students, Reporter|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/photo/scenes-of-indiscriminate-violence-in-letpadan-as-police-attack-ambulance-workers-students-reporter.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, as the deadline expired, the students began to remove the barbed wire set up by the police but their attempt was futile.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; After their second attempt an hour later, the police declared that the protest was illegal and ordered the students to evacuate the monastery five persons at a time and not to leave Yangon in one group.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The students refused and turned themselves in for peaceful arrests.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police then initiated an assault on the protesters including those inside the monastery.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The exact number of injured people was not confirmed but the estimate was around 100.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police also attacked on volunteers working to escort the injured.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; Zar Zar Tun from [[Free Funeral Service Society]], an organization in support of the movement from the beginning, announced that the first ambulance provided by the organization transported six men and two women one of whom suffered a severe head injury. In a statement released by the Ministry of Information, a total of 127 people – 100 men and 27 women – were arrested.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The Myanmar Council also released a statement later that afternoon condemning the arrest of the journalists during the crackdown.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; At 2:30 pm on the same day, a group of students marching from Hledan junction in Yangon to downtown was also dispersed using force, minutes after the protest began. Several people were injured and initially one of the protesters was handcuffed but later released at the scene after the students plead and agreed to disband.&lt;ref name="rangoon student protest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title=Rangoon Student Protest Quashed Within Minutes|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/rangoon-student-protest-quashed-within-minutes.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letpadan crackdown received criticism from the [[European Union]] as well as the NLD, which was not in support of the current student movement.

One of the most visible approaches to '''peer learning''' comes out of [[cognitive psychology]], and is applied within a "mainstream" [[education]]al framework: "Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."&lt;ref name="peer-learning-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it can be compared to the practices that go by the name [[cooperative learning]]. However, other contemporary views on peer learning relax the constraints, and position "'''peer-to-peer learning'''" as a mode of "learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything."&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt&gt;Jeff Brazil, May 23, 2011, [http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it takes place in a [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[Informal learning|informal]] learning context, in small groups or [[Social peer-to-peer processes|online]], peer learning manifests aspects of [[self-organization]] that are mostly absent from [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] models of teaching and learning.

==Connections with other practices==
=== Constructivism===
In his 1916 book, [[Democracy and Education]], [[John Dewey]] wrote, “Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” In a later essay, entitled "Experience and Education",&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ndemers/colloquium/ExperiencEducationDewey.pdf Experience and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey went into greater detail about the science of child development and developed the basic [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist]] theory that knowledge is created through experience, rather than passed down from teacher to student through rote memorization.  Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], who developed the concept of the [[Zone of Proximal Development]], was another proponent of constructivist learning: his book, ''Thought and Language'', provides evidence that students learn better through collaborative, meaningful problem-solving activities than through solo exercises.

The three distinguishing features of constructivist theory are claims that:&lt;ref name=akhras-and-self&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning occurs within a context that is itself part of what is learned
* Knowing and doing cannot be separated
* Learning is a process that is extended over time
These are clearly meaningful propositions in a social context with sustained relationships, where people work on projects or tasks that are collaborative or otherwise shared.

Educational Psychology Professor Alison King explains in "Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning"&lt;ref name=alisonking&gt;Alison King, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1477535?seq=4 Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; that peer learning exercises as simple as having students explain concepts to one another are proof of social constructivism theory at work; the act of teaching another individual demands that students “clarify, elaborate on, and otherwise reconceptualize material.” Joss Winn, Senior Lecturer in Educational Research at University of Lincoln, proposes that schools radically redefine the teacher-student relationship to fit this constructivist theory of knowledge in his December 2011 paper, "Student as Producer".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Joss Winn, [http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/01/28/pedagogy-technology-and-student-as-producer/ Student as Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]]' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"&lt;ref name=carlrogers&gt;[http://www.panarchy.org/rogers/learning.html Carl Rogers' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"]&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the individual’s experience of effective learning, and eventually conclude that nearly the entire traditional educational structure is at odds with this experience. Self-discovered learning in a group that designates a facilitator is the “new approach” Rogers recommends for education.

In general, peer learning may adapt [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] or [[discovery learning]] methods for the peer-to-peer context: however, peer learning typically manifests constructivist ideas in a more informal way, when [[learning]] and [[collaboration]] are simply applied to solve some real shared problem.

===Critical pedagogy===

[[Critical pedagogy]] engages students and instructors in analyzing and critiquing power structures around them. The most influential scholar in the development of this field was [[Paulo Freire]], whose book [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] described the traditional teaching framework as a “banking system” in which students are thought of as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge and concepts.  Instead, Freire advocated a more equitable relationship between teachers and students, one in which information is questioned and situated in political context, and all participants in the classroom work together to create knowledge.

Freire’s vision for dialogical education, where learning is situated within students’ lived experience, has been commonly deemed idealistic by modern educators.  Yet Paulo Blikstein, Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford University wrote in ''Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation''&lt;ref name=troy&gt;[http://www.blikstein.com/paulo/documents/books/Blikstein-TravelsInTroyWithFreire.pdf Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation]&lt;/ref&gt; that through exploratory building activities, “Not only did students become more autonomous and responsible, they learned to teach one another.”

=== Connectivism ===

[[Yochai Benkler]] explains how the now-ubiquitous computer helps us produce and process knowledge together with others in his book, [[The Wealth of Networks]]. [[George Siemens]] argues in [http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories of the past.  In practice, the ideas of connectivism developed in and alongside the then-new social formation, "[[massive open online course]]s" or MOOCs.

[[Connectivism]] proposes that the knowledge we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, as if we are a member of a large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.

Rita Kop and Adrian Hill, in their critique of connectivism,&lt;ref name=connectivism-critique&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that:
: it does not seem that connectivism’s contributions to the new paradigm warrant it being treated as a separate learning theory in and of its own right.  Connectivism, however, continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.

== Perspectives of other modern theorists ==

In a joint paper, Roy Williams, Regina Karousou, and Jenny Mackness argue that educational institutions should consider "emergent learning," in which learning arises from a self-organized group interaction, as a valuable component of education in the Digital Age.  Web 2.0 puts distributed individuals into a group setting where emergent learning can occur. However, deciding how to manage emergence is important; “fail-safe” management drives activity towards pre-determined outcomes, while “safe/fail experiments” steer away from negative outcomes while leaving space open for mistakes and innovation.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{Cite journal

| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ''et al.'' also distinguish between the term “environment” as controlled, and “ecology” as free/open.

[[Cathy Davidson]] and [[David Theo Goldberg]] write in ''The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age'' about the potential of “participatory learning,” and a new paradigm of education that is focused on mediated interactions between peers.
They argue that if institutions of higher learning could begin to value this type of learning, instead of simply trying to implement “Instructional Technology” in classrooms, they could transform old models of university education. Davidson and Goldberg introduce “Ten Principles for the Future of Learning,”  which include self-learning, horizontal structures, and open source education.  [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s recent book "You Must Change Your Life" proposes similar ideas in the context of a "General Disciplinics" that would "counteract the atrophy of the educational system" by focusing on forms of learning that takes place through direct participation in the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Sloterdijk-change"&gt;{{Cite book

Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff proposed the label “paragogy” to describe a collection of “best practices of effective peer learning.”&lt;ref name=paragogy-paper&gt;Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff, [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Arided/ParagogyPaper Paragogy: Synergizing individual and organizational learning]&lt;/ref&gt; They published a short book&lt;ref name="paragogy-book"&gt;{{Cite book

along with several papers in which they discuss five "paragogical principles" that form the core of their proposed [[Learning theory (education)#Informal and post-modern theories|learning theory]].  These were generated by rethinking [[Malcolm Knowles]] principles of [[andragogy]] for a learning context that is co-created by the learners.

==Experiments==

The learning theories and approaches described above are currently being tested in peer-learning communities around the world, often adapting [[educational technology]] to support [[informal learning]], though results in formal learning contexts exist too.  For example, [[Eric Mazur]] and colleagues report on "Ten years of experience and results" with a teaching technique they call "[[Peer Instruction]]":

: Peer Instruction engages students during class through activities that require each student to apply the core concepts being presented, and then to explain those concepts to their fellow students.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Peer instruction: Ten years of experience and results,

| year=2001
| doi=10.1119/1.1374249
| citeseerx=10.1.1.113.6060
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach made early use of a variant of the technique that is now known as the "[[flipped classroom]]":

: To free up class time for ConcepTests, and to prepare students better to apply the material during class, students are required to complete the reading on the topics to be covered before class.

[[P2PU|Peer 2 Peer University]], or P2PU, which was founded in 2009 by Philipp Schmidt and others, is an example from the informal learning side.  Speaking about the beginnings of P2PU, Schmidt echoes Siemens’ connectivism ideas and explains that, “The expertise is in the group. That’s the message, that everyone can bring something to the conversation.”&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt /&gt;  In numerous public talks, Schmidt argues that current educational models are "broken" (particularly on the basis of the high cost of university-level training).   He suggests that social assessment mechanisms similar to those applied in open-source software development can be applied to education.&lt;ref name="jps"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jeff Young’s article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas",&lt;ref name=young&gt;Jeff Young, Chronicle of Higher Education, [http://chronicle.com/article/When-Professors-Print-Their/1185/ When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a conversation about the necessity of formal degrees in an age when class lectures can be uploaded for free. The MIT Open Teaching initiative, for example, has since 2001 put all of its course materials online.  But [[David A. Wiley]], then Psychology Professor at Utah State, went further, signing certificates for whoever takes his class.  A similar practice has become even more visible in learning projects like [[Udacity]], [[Coursera]], and [[EdX]].  Although these projects attempt to "scale education" by distributing learning materials produced by experts (not classic examples of peer learning), they do frequently feature peer-to-peer discussions in forums or offline.&lt;ref name=anya&gt;Anya Kamenetz, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2012/06/kamenetz Who can Learn Online, And How?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in development ==

In the forward to a book on the ''Power of peer learning'' by Jean-H. Guilmette, Maureen O'Neil, then president of Canada's International Development Research Centre, states that
: Our experience has proven that [peer learning] is an efficient way to transmit knowledge across a wide range of groups or regions. Peer learning, based on jointly generated evidence, is also an effective means to build capacity and foster scientific excellence. The body of knowledge it generates is a powerful tool for the development of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref name=power-peer&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = IDRC, Ottawa, ON, CA
| url = http://hdl.handle.net/10625/28624
| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilmette suggests that peer learning is useful in the development context because
:It is my view that managing networks, especially those that are made up of sovereign nations, is fundamentally different from managing companies, organizations, or ministries that fall under a single authority. In essence, the dominant management approach for companies and institutions rests on cybernetics, with the view of keeping communications and accountability simple and clear. Managing methods that are successful in such a context [are] counterproductive when managing networks.

Guilmette cites Anne K. Bernard, who in a report based on extensive interviews, concludes:

: Effective networks act not simply on the basis of optimizing within constraints by attempting to force-fit predicted, linear and regulated programmes of work onto dynamic policy and client communities. Rather, they hone capacities and create mechanisms for the regular feedback and reflected analyses which are needed to deal with the ambiguity of these environments, and to adapt interactively with them.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{Cite book

==Challenges==

[[Marlene Scardamalia|Scardamalia]] and [[Carl Bereiter|Bereiter]] explain in "Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities"&lt;ref name=s-and-b&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466822 Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; that computers in the classroom have the opportunity to restructure the learning environment, but too often they are simply used to provide a digital version of a normal lesson or exam. They propose that classrooms be exchanged for “[[Knowledge building|knowledge-building communities]]” where students can use computers to connect to and create knowledge in the outside world.  However, as illustrated in citations above, this way of thinking about learning is often at odds with traditional educational praxis.

In "The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning", Kurliha, Miettinen, Nokelainen, and Tirri found a "difference in
learning outcomes based on the tools used."&lt;ref name=k-and-m&gt;J. Kurhila, M. Miettinen, P. Nokelainen, and H. Tirri, [http://cosco.hiit.fi/Articles/hiit-2004-10.pdf The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variables at work are not well understood, and are the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=alpine-retreat&gt;Call for participation: Workshop at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 January, 28 - February, 1st 2013 [http://engaged.hnlc.org/story_comments/list/18 It's About Time: Addressing the Many Challenges of Analyzing Multi-Scale Temporal Data]&lt;/ref&gt;   Within a formal education setting, a 1994 study found that students were more responsive to feedback from a teacher than they were to [[Peer feedback#Limitations|peer feedback]].  However, another later study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive impact on individual student performance.

A classic study&lt;ref name=garbarino&gt;{{cite journal

Although other more recent work has shown that non-monetary rewards or acknowledgement can make a difference in ''performance'' (for certain populations of peer producers),&lt;ref name=barnstar&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid=22479610
| pmc=3315525
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact motivations for going out of the way to teach or tutor someone else are not clearly understood. As mentioned [[Peer Learning#Connections with Constructivism|above]], learning is often just part of solving a problem, so "peer learning" and "peer teaching" would tend to happen informally when people solve problems in groups.

==Peer learning in practice==
===Research on peer learning===

Research on peer learning may involve [[participant observation]], and may itself be [[Commons-Based Peer Production|peer produced]].  Some of this research falls under the broader umbrella of [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]].  [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] is one obvious context in which to study peer learning, since in such settings "learning is observably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity."&lt;ref name=koschmann&gt;{{Cite journal
| last=Koschmann
| first=T.
| year=2001
| title=Revising the paradigms of instructional technology
| journal=Meeting at the Crossroads: 8th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, peer learning can play a role in settings where traditional conceptions of both "teaching" and "learning" do not apply, for instance, in [[peer review|academic peer review]], in [[organizational learning]], in development work, and in public health programmes.  Research in these areas may fall within the area of [[organizational studies|organization science]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS) or other fields.

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Staff was founded&lt;ref&gt;Заявление о создании штаба по защите русских школ. Published in: "Ракурс" No. 1/2003 The text of the founding statement is available [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/party/istorija/18988-/ online {{ru icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being [[ForHRUL]], and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the [[Freedom House]] and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=473c550523 Freedom in the World 2005.

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

      <comment>The page included uncited claims about students in self-directed education programs. It also stated that there isn't research on outcomes for students in SDE programs, described a narrow definition of SOLE, and implied that play is a distraction rather than a productive part of a child's development (see the work of Peter Gray and David Lancy). I removed the unsubstantiated claims and explained how the definition of SOLEs has expanded. The spelling of "organized" is still mismatched.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">A '''Self Organized Learning Environment''' ('''SOLE''') is a program designed to support self-directed education. [[Sugata Mitra]], an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his [[Sugata Mitra#Hole in the Wall|Hole in the Wall]] experiments.&lt;ref name="TT SM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education/transcript?language=en | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education (transcript) | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and "[r]esearch since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the [[School in the Cloud]] project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding "Granny" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs.

==Initial Experiments &amp; Project SOLE==
One of the things that was learned through the program is that children are often smarter than given credit for. Rather than providing lectures or spoon-feeding information to the students, it is better to ask "engaging, provocative questions" and let them work out the answers. It was also determined to be good to let the students self-direct in the areas that are of interest to them, with the idea that students will then often stretch to comprehend information that might have otherwise been too difficult for them.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

Other findings were that the educational experience is enhanced through collaboration and teamwork, that speech-to-text software is an effective tool for learning to speak a new language, and that tests asking students to solve real-life problems are more effective at prompting students to apply and demonstrate their learning than standard tests.&lt;ref name="IATEFL"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.academia.edu/7475327/Classrooms_in_the_cloud_or_castles_in_the_air |title=Classrooms in the clouds or castles in the air | magazine=Voices | publisher=International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL)|date=July–August 2014 | number=239 | via=academia.edu |author=Michał Paradowski |pages=8–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first student in India to use the program was Gouri Chindarkar (born about 1996) from Sangli in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sunny-Leone-Neha-Singh-on-BBCs-100-most-influential-women-list/articleshow/55559311.cms|title=Sunny Leone, Neha Singh on BBC’s 100 most influential women list - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianewsbulletin.com/bbc-2016-100-women-list-sunny-leone-mallika-srinivasan-neha-singh-saalumarada-thimmakka-gourichindarkar|title=BBC 100 Women 2016 List: Sunny Leone and 4 Indian women in inspirational and influential list|website=India News Bulletin|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned about the program through a mentor, an American woman named Ann Thomas, who met with her at 6:30 in the morning. She used a computer for the first time, and her schoolwork delivered in English; her native language is [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37405969|title=100 Women 2016: The girl who learnt in the cloud|date=2016-11-22|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouri Chindarkar has since studied Computing Engineering at the [[Kankavli|Kankavali]] campus of [[Mumbai University]] and she was selected as one of the BBC's [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women in 2016]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Project SOLE was begun in 10 locations in [[Hyderabad]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], with an 11th one in [[Sindhudurg district|Sindhudurg]] rural area of [[Maharashtra]] over a period of 2 years, 2008 to 2009. It is not clear to what extent the learning is effective over the long-term.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

== The School In The Cloud ==
In their own words, "The School in the Cloud platform was originally launched at the 2014 TED conference to help accelerate this research by helping educators — be they teachers, parents or community leaders — to run their own SOLEs and to contribute to the global experiment by sharing their experiences with others. It is now managed by SOLE Central at Newcastle University, a global hub for SOLE research and practice directed by Sugata Mitra."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are currently experimenting to refine and increase access to education programs that blend the SOLE approach of encouraging student groups to self-direct online learning with lessons from the [[Philosophy for Children|Philosophy For Children]] (P4C) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/blogpost/3430/|title=A philosophical approach to SOLE {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation Within Institutionalized Education==
Though Mitra's initial experiments focused on children living in unstable environments and in poverty, his findings inspired educators in a wide variety of environments to adapt his work. Teachers in both traditional and progressive environments have found ways to incorporate the SOLE approach in their work, whether for the span of a lesson or a semester. One prominent education blog suggests, "Consider it a tool for introducing and generating interest in a new topic, as well as broadening your students’ understanding of a familiar topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edutopia.org/blog/getting-started-self-organized-learning-environments-jacquelyn-omalley|title=Getting Started With Self-Organized Learning Environments {{!}} Edutopia|work=Edutopia|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the SOLE is just one element in a larger inquiry or project-based learning cycle.

==Adaptation Beyond Institutionalized Education==
For some, the initial SOLE projects showed the immense potential for learning in settings where students leverage technology and social learning to explore their interests with minimal interference. The US nonprofit Black Mountain SOLE opened a community center "inspired by the idea that human curiosity is the best motivation for learning" and identifying as an adaptation from earlier SOLE projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blackmountainsole.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Blackmountainsole|work=Blackmountainsole|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agile Learning Centers]] and a number of the projects that are part of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education also consider themselves to either be or be inspired by SOLEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://self-directed.org/|title=Alliance for Self-Directed Education {{!}} Home Page|work=Alliance for Self-Directed Education|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2337">'''Shokuiku''' ([[Kanji]]: 食育) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "[[food]] [[education]]". The law defines it as the "acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]".

It was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.&lt;ref name="GotoMurayama2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goto|first1=Keiko|last2=Murayama|first2=Nobuko|last3=Honda|first3=Sayaka|title=The Perceived Roles of Fast Foods and Shokuiku (Food and Nutrition Education) in Healthy and Sustainable Food Practices in Japan|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=41|issue=4|year=2009|pages=S2–S3|issn=14994046|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2009.03.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Major concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:
* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.
* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Families not eating meals together.

Classes in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Frank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">{{About|the two-body problem of dual-career academic couples|the two-body problem in classical mechanics|two-body problem}}

The '''two-body problem''' is a [[dilemma]] for life partners (for e.g. spouses or any other couple) in [[academia]], relating to the difficulty of both spouses obtaining jobs at the same university or within a reasonable commuting distance from each other. The central dilemma is thus a [[no-win situation]] in which if the couple wishes to stay together one of them may be forced to abandon an academic career, or if both wish to pursue academic careers the relationship may falter due to the spouses being constantly separated.&lt;ref name="Benton2009"&gt;Benton, Thomas H. (pen name of [[William Pannapacker]]) (2009). "[http://chronicle.com/article/Just-Dont-Go-Part-2/44786/ Just Don't Go, Part 2]". ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 13 March 2009, accessed 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Compromises the couple makes while trying to negotiate the two-body problem have implications for gender inequality.&lt;ref name="Wong2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong|first1=Jaclyn|date=16 March 2017 |title=Competing Desires: How Young Adult Couples Negotiate Moving for Career Opportunities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217695520|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=31|issue=2|pages=171–196|doi= 10.1177/0891243217695520 |access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''two-body problem'' has been used in the context of working couples since at least the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Benton2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil &amp; Sher"&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil|first=Laurie|title=REPORT ON THE DUAL-CAREER-COUPLE SURVEY|url=http://www.physics.wm.edu/~sher/survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alludes to the insolvable [[three-body problem]] in classical mechanics.

More than 70 percent of academic faculty have a working partner, while more than a third of faculty have an academic partner.&lt;ref name=clayman&gt;{{cite web|author1=Londa Schiebinger |author2=Andrea Davies Henderson |author3=Shannon K. Gilmartin |title=Dual-Career Academic Couples: What Universities Need to Know|url=https://gender.stanford.edu/publications/dual-career-academic-couples-what-universities-need-know|accessdate=19 March 2012|publisher=The Clayman Institute for Gender Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2017}}
Typical solutions include:
* two [[tenure-track]] positions at the same university
* two tenure-track positions at two nearby universities (daily commutes possible)
* two tenure-track positions with one or both partners commuting between two geographically separate institutions (daily commutes impossible because of distance; partners may be separated weekly or for semesters at a time, depending on their circumstances)
* one tenure-track position shared (if they are in the same field)
* one tenure-track position and one instructor position
* one tenure-track position and one industry position
* one tenure-track position and one administration position at a same university
* one tenure-track position and one position in government or with a private consulting firm (feasible in fields such as [[engineering]] and [[management]], probably infeasible in [[humanities]])

Although it is not an ideal solution, a possible outcome is a break-up of the relationship. Long distance commuting certainly places a strain on relationships, especially when maintained over long periods (years or even decades). Many academic institutes recognize the two-body problem is a challenging issue when they hire a new faculty member, and prepare policies to help dual-career academic couples to settle down at their institutions.  An institution in a small, rural state such as [[Wyoming]] may be under increased pressure to hire a spouse than in a large metropolitan area with many colleges and universities such as [[Boston]].

More proactive institutions may establish funds and procedures to assist with this situation.  Frequently a university will seek to hire one person in a couple, thereby making the other the "trailing spouse." One approach is for a tenure-track position to be funded for the trailing spouse be a combination of funds from both academic departments involved with additional funds from the dean and/or provost. Substantial resources must be offered external to the department that would accept the trailing spouse, as this department would not typically be in the position to hire said person nor would that particular person necessarily rank highly if a search were to be conducted.  For this reason, it is not unusual for departments to reject the trailing spouse even if substantial external funds are made available.  This makes the problem particularly intractable, as qualified persons may remain unemployed simply because they are not an ideal fit for the trailing department.  More commonly, institutions do not have such proactive programs in place.

The original [[Latin]] word ''universitas'' refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, [[corporation]], etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Charlton T. | last2 = Short | first2 = Charles | title = A Latin Dictionary | place = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | origyear = 1879 | year = 1966 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the emergence of urban town life and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[guild]]s, specialized "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia L. Colish, ''Medieval Foundations of the Western Intellectual Tradition, 400-1400,'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1997), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage the word has come to mean "An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly non-vocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = university, n. | year = 2010 | title = OED Online | edition = 3rd  | contribution-url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/214804?rskey=Owl6ZY&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false |accessdate = 27 August 2013 | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press| title-link = OED Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = university, n. | year = 2010 | title = OED Online | edition = 3rd  | contribution-url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/214804?rskey=Owl6ZY&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false |accessdate = 27 August 2013 | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | quote = …In the Middle Ages: a body of teachers and students engaged in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of study … and regarded as a scholastic guild or corporation.| title-link = OED Online }} Compare {{Citation | contribution = University | year = 1989 | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd  | editor-last = | editor-first = | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | quote = The whole body of teachers and scholars engaged, at a particular place, in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of learning; such persons associated together as a society or corporate body, with definite organization and acknowledged powers and privileges (esp. that of conferring degrees), and forming an institution for the promotion of education in the higher or more important branches of learning….| title-link = Oxford English Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], where this form of legal organisation was prevalent, and from where the institution spread around the world.

====Academic freedom====
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of [[academic freedom]]. The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the [[University of Bologna]], which adopted an academic charter, the ''[[Authentica habita|Constitutio Habit]]a'',&lt;ref&gt;Malagola, C. (1888), Statuti delle Università e dei Collegi dello Studio Bolognese. Bologna: Zanichelli.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1158 or 1155,&lt;ref name="Rüegg, W. 2003 pp 4-34"&gt;Rüegg, W. (2003), Mythologies and Historiography of the Beginnings, pp 4-34 in H. De Ridder-Symoens, editor, A History of the University in [[Europe]]; Vol 1, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, P. (2005), Ideas. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 373&lt;/ref&gt; This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the ''[[Magna Charta Universitatum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.unibo.it/avl/charta/charta.htm |title=Magna Charta delle Università Europee |publisher=.unibo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115001914/http://www2.unibo.it/avl/charta/charta.htm |archivedate=15 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. The number of universities signing the ''Magna Charta Universitatum'' continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.

Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made early [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] universities similar to Islamic [[madrasa]]s, although madrasas were generally smaller, and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pryds | first = Darleen | editor-last = Courtenay | editor-first = William J. | editor2-last = Miethke | editor2-first = Jürgen | editor3-last = Priest | editor3-first = David B. | publication-date = 2000 | title = Universities and Schooling in Medieval Society | chapter = ''Studia'' as Royal Offices: Mediterranean Universities of Medieval Europe | series = Education and Society in the Middle Ages and Renaissance | volume = 10 | publisher = Brill | publication-place = Leiden | pages = 96–98 | url = https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:9004113517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars like [[Arnold H.

===Medieval universities===
[[File:Bologna-vista02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[University of Bologna]] in [[Italy]], founded in 1088, is the oldest university, the word ''university'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''universitas'') having been coined at its foundation.]]
{{Main|Medieval university|List of medieval universities}}
The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Catholic]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"&gt;Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword. The University as a European Institution", in: ''A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-521-36105-2}}, pp. XIX–XX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verger |first=Jacques |title=Gentes del saber: en la Europa de finales de la Edad Media |year=1999 |publisher=Editorial Complutense |pages=259 |isbn=9788489784697 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Wf3aqgLY-_wC&amp;printsec=frontcover |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; European higher education took place for hundreds of years in [[Christianity|Catholic ]] [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp. 126-7, 282-98&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the [[Latin Church]] by [[papal bull]] as ''[[Studium Generale|studia generalia]]'' and perhaps from Catholic cathedral schools. It is possible, however,  that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Leff, ''Paris and Oxford Universities in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. An Institutional and Intellectual History'', Wiley, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Later they were also founded by Kings ([[University of Naples Federico II]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian University in Kraków]]) or municipal administrations ([[University of Cologne]], [[University of Erfurt]]). In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. (2000). The Renaissance : a short history. Modern Library chronicles (Modern Library ed.). New York: Modern Library, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gregory VII]] was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of Catholic cathedral schools  that transformed themselves into the first European universities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Oestreich (1913). "Pope St. Gregory VII". In Herbermann, Charles. Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first universities in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the [[University of Bologna]] (1088), the [[University of Paris]] (c.1150, later associated with the [[Sorbonne]]), and the [[University of Oxford]] (1167).

The University of Bologna began as a law school teaching the ''[[jus gentium|ius gentium]]'' or [[Roman law]] of peoples which was in demand across Europe for those defending the right of incipient nations against empire and church. Bologna's special claim to ''[[Alma Mater Studiorum]]''{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} is based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, and other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution&lt;ref name="Rüegg, W. 2003 pp 4-34"/&gt; independent of kings, emperors or any kind of direct religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G.

The conventional date of 1088, or 1087 according to some,&lt;ref&gt;Huff, T. (2003), The Rise of Early Modern Science. Cambridge University Press, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; records when [[Irnerius]] commences teaching Emperor Justinian's 6th century codification of Roman law, the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'', recently discovered at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into 'Nationes', divided between that of the Cismontanes and that of the Ultramontanes. The students "had all the power … and dominated the masters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Kerr|first = Clark|date=2001|title = The Uses of the University|publisher = Harvard University Press|pages =16 and 145|isbn = 978-0674005327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, W. (2003), Mythologies and Historiography of the Beginnings, pp 4-34 in H. De Ridder-Symoens, editor, A History of the University in Europe; Vol 1, Cambridge University Press.p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]–the preparatory arts of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectic]] or [[logic]]–and the [[quadrivium]]: [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].

All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]'s works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated–fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, R. E. (2003). Aristotle's children: how Christians, Muslims, and Jews rediscovered ancient wisdom and illuminated the dark ages (1st ed.). Orlando, Florida: Harcourt, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works "a turning point in the history of Western thought."&lt;ref&gt;Dales, R. C. (1990). Medieval discussions of the eternity of the world (Vol. 18). Brill Archive, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this "[[scholasticism]]" were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.

[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Heidelberg University]] is the oldest [[List of universities in Germany|university in Germany]] and among Europe's best ranked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/university/rankings/ Rankings: Universität Heidelberg in International Comparison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921065348/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/university/rankings/ |date=21 September 2014 }} - Top Position in Germany, Leading Role in Europe (Heidelberg University)&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1386.]]

The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, [[disputation]]s and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, [[natural philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]]; while [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]] were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = J. C. | year = 2006 | title = The mission of the university: Medieval to Postmodern transformations | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education | volume = 77 | issue = 1| page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a "self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars" and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were "founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pryds | first = Darleen | editor-last = Courtenay | editor-first = William J. | editor2-last = Miethke | editor2-first = Jürgen | editor3-last = Priest | editor3-first = David B. | publication-date = 2000 | title = Universities and Schooling in Medieval Society | chapter = ''Studia'' as Royal Offices: Mediterranean Universities of Medieval Europe | series = Education and Society in the Middle Ages and Renaissance | volume = 10 | publisher = Brill | publication-place = Leiden | pages = 84–85 | url = https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:9004113517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern universities===
{{See also|List of early modern universities in Europe|List of colonial universities in Latin America}}

During the [[Early Modern period]] (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first European university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term "university" was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In Mediterranean countries, the term ''[[studium generale]]'' was still often used, while "Academy" was common in Northern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Class at Salamanca.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|17th century classroom at the [[University of Salamanca]]]]
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the [[Thirty Years' War]], disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, [[regicide]], and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This era was also affected by the rise of the [[nation-state]]. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = J. C. | year = 2006 | title = The mission of the university: Medieval to Postmodern transformations | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education | volume = 77 | issue = 1| pages = 10–13 | doi=10.1353/jhe.2006.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty "masters", provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at [[University of Oxford]] where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization.&lt;ref&gt;Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: [[natural philosophy]], logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and [[rhetoric]]. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, W. (1992). Epilogue: the rise of humanism. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in the Middle Ages, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the [[studia humanitatis]]. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Professors of medicine such as [[Niccolò Leoniceno]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, [[Andreas Vesalius]] was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the ''[[Corpus Juris]]'' with a humanist perspective, while [[Jacques Cujas]] humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] cited the works of [[Erasmus]] as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, W. (1996). Themes. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, pp. 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]], who taught at the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[University of Padua|Padua]], and [[Martin Luther]], who taught at the [[University of Wittenberg]] (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research.&lt;ref&gt;Bylebyl, J. J. (2009). Disputation and description in the renaissance pulse controversy. In A. Wear, R. K. French, &amp; I. M. Lonie (Eds.), The medical renaissance of the sixteenth century (1st ed., pp. 223-245). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices.&lt;ref&gt;Füssel, S. (2005). Gutenberg and the Impact of Printing (English ed.). Aldershot, Hampshire: Ashgate Pub., p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution. Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university, the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution. Historians such as [[Richard S. Westfall]] have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, R. S. (1977). The construction of modern science: mechanisms and mechanics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors, usually in princely courts, and associations with newly forming scientific societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, M. (1928). The role of scientific societies in the seventeenth century. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westman | first1 = R. S. | year = 1975 | title = The Melanchthon circle:, rheticus, and the Wittenberg interpretation of the Copernicantheory | doi = 10.1086/351431| journal = Isis | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 164–193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 245-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a "general scholar" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time, as individual scientists, associations and universities were vying for limited resources. There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions, they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 =  | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = M | year = 1995 | title = The snakestone experiments: an early modern medical debate | doi = 10.1086/357237 | pmid =  7591659| journal = Isis | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 394–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.

===Modern universities===
{{Main|History of European research universities|List of modern universities in Europe (1801–1945)}}
[[File:Strand102.jpg|thumb|[[King's College London]], established by Royal Charter having been founded by [[King George IV]] and [[Duke of Wellington]] in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the [[University of London]].]]
[[File:Uni KA Portal.jpg|thumb|[[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], a German technical university, founded in the 19th century]]
By the 18th century, universities published their own [[academic journal|research journals]] and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of [[academic freedom|freedom]], [[seminar]]s, and [[laboratory|laboratories]] in universities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.

Until the 19th century, [[religion]] played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses. In the United States, the [[Johns Hopkins University]] was the first to adopt the (German) [[research university]] model; this pioneered the adoption by most other American universities.  In Britain, the move from [[Industrial Revolution]] to [[modernity]] saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on [[science]] and [[engineering]], a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray (chairman of the University Grants Committee) and [[Samuel Curran|Sir Samuel Curran]], with the formation of the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306083652/http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British also established universities worldwide, and [[higher education]] became available to the masses not only in Europe.

In 1963, the [[Robbins Report]] on universities in the [[United Kingdom]] concluded that such institutions should have four main "objectives essential to any properly balanced system: instruction in skills; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women; to maintain research in balance with teaching, since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|title=The 'Idea of a University' today|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=March 2010|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127065822/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|archivedate=27 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, concerns were raised over the increasing managerialisation and standardisation of universities worldwide. Neo-liberal management models have in this sense been critiqued for creating "corporate universities (where) power is transferred from faculty to managers, economic justifications dominate, and the familiar 'bottom line' ecclipses pedagogical or intellectual concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Berg &amp; Barbara Seeber. The Slow Professor: Challenging the Culture of Speed in the Academy, p. x. Toronto: Toronto University Press. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Academics' understanding of time, pedagogical pleasure, vocation, and collegiality have been cited as possible ways of alleviating such problems.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Berg &amp; Barbara Seeber.

===National universities===
A [[national university]] is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national [[cultural]], [[religious]] or [[political]] aspirations, for instance the [[National University of Ireland]], which formed partly from the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] which was created almost immediately and specifically in answer to the non-denominational universities which had been set up in Ireland in 1850. In the years leading up to the [[Easter Rising]], and in no small part a result of the Gaelic Romantic revivalists, the NUI collected a large amount of information on the [[Irish language]] and [[Irish culture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reforms in Argentina were the result of the [[University Revolution]] of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic{{explain|date=August 2016}} higher education system.

===Intergovernmental universities===
[[File:Cornell University, Ho Plaza and Sage Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Campus university|Campus universities]] with most buildings clustered closely together became especially widespread since the 19th century ([[Cornell University]])]]
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]]. An example is the [[Academy of European Law]], which offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (Pôle Universitaire Euclide, Euclid University)]] is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries, and the [[United Nations University]] engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations, its peoples and member states. The [[European University Institute]], a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organisation, set up by the member states of the [[European Union]].

==Organization==
[[File:SydneyUniversity MainQuadrangle panorama 270.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[University of Sydney]] is [[Australia]]'s oldest university.]]
Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president, [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], or [[Rector (academia)|rector]]; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. [[Public university]] systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards. They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] autonomy. [[private university|Private universities]] are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.

==Around the world==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges by country}}

The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|title=Basic Classification Technical Details|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=2007-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613225633/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|archivedate=13 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

{{Further|Category:Higher education by country}}

The definition of a university varies widely, even within some countries.  Where there is clarification, it is usually set by a government agency.  For example:

In Australia, the [[Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency]] (TEQSA) is Australia's independent national regulator of the higher education sector.  Students rights within university are also protected by the Education Services for Overseas Students Act (ESOS).

In the United States there is no nationally standardized definition for the term ''university'', although the term has traditionally been used to designate [[research institution]]s and was once reserved for doctorate-granting research institutions. Some states, such as [[Massachusetts]], will only grant a school "university status" if it grants at least two [[doctoral degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.edu/forinstitutions/academic/documents/610CMR.pdf |title=Massachusetts Board of Education: Degree-granting regulations for independent institutions of higher education |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] is responsible for approving the use of the word ''university'' in the name of an institution, under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=2007-12-06 |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223084511/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |archivedate= 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a new designation [[deemed university|deemed universities]] has been created for institutions of higher education that are not universities, but work at a very high standard in a specific area of study ("An Institution of Higher Education, other than universities, working at a very high standard in specific area of study, can be declared by the Central Government on the advice of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] as an Institution 'Deemed-to-be-university'"). Institutions that are 'deemed-to-be-university' enjoy the academic status and the privileges of a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deemed University|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/deemed-university|website=mhrd.gov.in|publisher=MHRD|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207204836/http://mhrd.gov.in/deemed-university|archivedate=7 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this provision many schools that are commercial in nature and have been established just to exploit the demand for higher education have sprung up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=&amp;mdash; Peter Drucker |url=http://learnhub.com/news/1254- |title='Deemed' status distributed freely during Arjun Singh's tenure - LearnHub News |publisher=Learnhub.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707120057/http://learnhub.com/news/1254- |archivedate=7 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, ''college'' generally refers to a two-year, non-degree-granting institution, while ''university'' connotes a four-year, degree-granting institution. Universities may be sub-classified (as in the [[Rankings of universities in Canada|Macleans rankings]]) into large research universities with many PhD-granting programs and medical schools (for example, [[McGill University]]); "comprehensive" universities that have some PhDs but are not geared toward research (such as [[University of Waterloo|Waterloo]]); and smaller, primarily undergraduate universities (such as [[St. Francis Xavier University|St. Francis Xavier]]).

In [[Germany]], universities are institutions of higher education which have the power to confer bachelor, master and PhD degrees. They are explicitly recognised as such by law and cannot be founded without government approval. The term Universitaet (i.e. the German term for university) is protected by law and any use without official approval is a criminal offense. Most of them are public institutions, though a few private universities exist. Such universities are always research universities. Apart from these universities, Germany has other institutions of higher education (Hochschule, [[Fachhochschule]]). Fachhochschule means a higher education institution which is similar to the former [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] in the British education system, the English term used for these German institutions is usually 'university of applied sciences'. They can confer master degrees but no PhDs. They are similar to the model of [[teaching universities]] with less research and the research undertaken being highly practical. Hochschule can refer to various kinds of institutions, often specialised in a certain field (e.g. music, fine arts, business). They might or might not have the power to award PhD degrees, depending on the respective government legislation. If they award PhD degrees, their rank is considered equivalent to that of universities proper (Universitaet), if not, their rank is equivalent to universities of applied sciences.

==Colloquial usage==
{{main|College}}
Colloquially, the term ''university'' may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland, ''college'' is often used instead: "When I was in college..."). In Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the [[German-speaking countries]], ''university'' is often contracted to ''uni''. In Ghana, New Zealand, Bangladesh and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} "Varsity" is still in common usage in Scotland.

In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States was US$30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095420/http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |archivedate=21 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students at Public Universities, Colleges Will Bear the Burden of Reduced Funding for Higher Education|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|accessdate=14 January 2013|work=Time|date=25 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309192745/http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in [[Nordic countries]] were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. Citizens of [[EU]] and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf "Studieavgifter i högskolan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515222157/http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf |date=15 May 2013 }} [[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2006:7 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation in Germany is similar; public universities usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge tuition fees.

'''Vision Forum''' was an [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Christian]] organization based in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. It was founded in 1998; its president was [[Doug Phillips]], son of [[U.S. Constitution Party]] leader [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]]. '''Vision Forum Ministries''' was a [[501(c)(3)|501(c)]] non-profit organization which was closed by its board of directors in November 2013 after Doug Phillips' confession of marital infidelity.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;Ingersoll, Julie, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-ingersoll/doug-phillips-biblical-patriarchy_b_5151442.html Doug Phillips’ Biblical Patriarchy Scandal Moves to the Courts], [[Huffington Post]] 17 June 2014.

Vision Forum advocated [[Biblical patriarchy]], [[creationism]], [[homeschooling]], [[Family Integrated Church]]es and [[Quiverfull]] beliefs.

==Distinctive beliefs==
{{See also|Biblical patriarchy}}
Vision Forum was an advocate of "biblical patriarchy". The "Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy" article on its website advocated such beliefs as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626134919/http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-26 |title=The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy |website=Vision Forum |access-date=2007-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

*God reveals Himself as [[Gender of God in Christianity|masculine]], not feminine.
*God ordained [[Complementarianism|distinct gender roles]] for man and woman as part of the created order. 
*A husband and father is the head of his household, a family leader, provider, and protector.
*Male leadership in the home carries over into the church: only men are permitted to hold the ruling office in the church. A God-honoring society will likewise prefer male leadership in civil and other spheres.
*Since the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a "keeper at home," the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household and that which is connected with the home.
*God's command to "[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]" [[Quiverfull|still applies]] to married couples.
*Christian parents must provide their children with a thoroughly Christian education, one that teaches the Bible and a biblical view of God and the world.
*Both sons and daughters are under the command of their fathers as long as they are under his roof or otherwise the recipients of his provision and protection.
*The [[Family integrated church|age-integrated]] communities of family and church are the God-ordained institutions for training and socialization and as such provide the preferred pattern for social life and educational endeavors.

== Events ==
The organization sponsored the Christian Filmmakers Academy and the [[San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/christian_filmmakers_to_discuss_replacement_industry_for_hollywood/|title=Christian filmmakers to discuss replacement industry for Hollywood|date=July 23, 2007|website=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christianpost.com/Entertainment/Events/2009/01/over-700-students-to-converge-ahead-of-top-christian-film-fest-04/index.html |title=Over 700 Students to Converge Ahead of Top Christian Film Fest |last=Kimball |first=Josh |date=January 4, 2009 |work=[[The Christian Post]] |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the group organized an alternative celebration of the 400th anniversary of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|founding of Jamestown, Virginia]], saying that the official celebration did not give enough emphasis to the Christian perspective of the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Geroux, Bill, "An alternative Jamestown fete: Christian group says it wants to shine more light on role of God", ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Vision Forum was criticized for allegedly holding views that demean women and view them as property. Don and Joy Veinot of [[Midwest Christian Outreach]] interpreted the Vision Forum statement to imply that "women really cannot be trusted as decision makers" and "unless a daughter marries, she functionally remains pretty much the ''property'' of the father until he dies."&lt;ref&gt;Veinot &amp; Veinot 2007, p=4 – emphasis original.&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that Vision Forum promoted a "pagan top-down view of authority".&lt;ref&gt;Veinot &amp; Veinot 2007 p=7&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar criticisms were voiced when a lawsuit was filed against Doug Phillips and Vision Forum, Inc. by a woman who had worked as the Phillips family's nanny. Her suit alleged that Phillips had sexually abused her for years. Phillips acknowledged an "inappropriate relationship" but denied all charges of sexual abuse, "calling them sensationalist and suggesting that they are motivated by a desire for financial gain."&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6698">The WAC Clearinghouse publishes [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access|open-access]] journals and books, as well as other professional resources for teachers and instructional materials for students. [[Writing across the curriculum|Writing-across-the-curriculum]] (WAC) refers to a formal programmatic approach within contemporary secondary and higher education composition studies that promotes the importance of writing in classes outside of composition. 

Working in partnership with the Association for Writing Across the Curriculum Programs (AWAC), the WAC Clearinghouse operates as a publishing collaborative, drawing on contributions from more than 125 individuals serving on the editorial boards of [[Academic journal|academic journals]] supported by the Clearinghouse, as editors or reviewers of its book series, as editors of resource pages on its website, and as members of the overall Clearinghouse editorial board. The open-access character of the scholarship available through the Clearinghouse book series provides free access to scholarly books and [[Textbook|textbooks]], providing students and teachers with an alternative to purchasing scholarly and classroom instructional materials. For individuals and libraries who wish to own print copies of its books, the Clearinghouse works with [[University Press of Colorado|University Press of Colorado]] to make print books available in low-cost editions. The Clearinghouse also collaborates with other open-access publishers in the field of [[Composition_studies|writing studies]], including Computers and Composition [[Digital printing|Digital Press]] and Writing Spaces, which both publish  open-access scholarly work, including innovative, [[Multimodality|multimodal]] digital writing projects, using traditional academic peer reviewed processes. The WAC Clearinghouse addresses several disciplinary areas within writing studies, such as [[Second language writing|second-language writing]], [[Writing fellow|writing fellows]], and writing in the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.

==History==
Established in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/about/brief-history/|title=A Brief History of the WAC Clearinghouse|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Clearinghouse is among the most successful open-access publishing projects in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Charles|title=Open access book publishing in writing studies: A case study|journal=First Monday|date=7 January 2008|volume=13|issue=1|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2088/1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmquist|first1=Mike|last2=Mullin|first2=Joan|last3=Blalock|first3=Glenn|editor=Lee Nickoson|others=Mary P.

The Clearinghouse also has published 90 books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neff|first1=Joyce Magnotto|last2=Whithaus|first2=Carl|title=Writing Across Distances and Disciplines: Research and Pedagogy in Distributed Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f-OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135596767|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides access to peer-reviewed resources for teachers who wish to use writing in courses across the disciplines, including a bibliography (published in collaboration with CompPile, which became part of the Clearinghouse in 2018), resource pages on writing fellows programs and [[Second language|second-language]] learners, conference proceedings, WAC program descriptions, a list of scholarly journals, and the 2014 Statement on WAC Principles and Practices, among others.

==Sustainable Publishing Initiative==

In May 2012, to mark its fifteenth year of operation, the WAC Clearinghouse launched the 25 Collective, a demonstration project for sustainable publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/sustain/|title=The Sustainable Publishing Initiative|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project was to publish 25 new books for a total expenditure of $50,000—a cost far below that borne by traditional academic presses. Leveraging university resources (office space, computing resources, and web servers), the project operated within its budget and had, by March 2017, reached its goal, producing 29 books at an average cost of less than $2000 per book. The success of the project led to the launch of the Colorado State University Open Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.colostate.edu/|title=Colorado State University Open Press|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a publishing project that supports the use of the publishing collaborative model developed through the WAC Clearinghouse in other disciplines.

==Support==

The Clearinghouse is hosted by [[Colorado State University]] and receives support from the Colorado State University Open Press. It also receives support from donations and funds from purchases of selected books in print form. Donations are used to defray costs associated with honoraria for graduate students who serve as copy editors and designers for Clearinghouse books, for accessibility to the Web site and publications, for the purchase of [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN numbers]], and for software and equipment expense. Interested patrons my donate online or by check through the Clearinghouse Web site.

Technological innovation has brought more computing to schools, and with it a need to protect students from inappropriate content across the web, while also allowing students to use content-rich educational sites that can enhance the learning experience.&lt;ref name=edweek&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/technology-in-education/ "Technology in Education"], [http://www.edweek.org/ew/index.html/ http://www.edweek.org/ew/index.html], 1 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply blocking off large portions of the Internet, many schools are utilizing customizable web filtering systems that allow them greater control over which sites are allowed and which are blocked. The [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA) requires that U.S. schools have appropriate measures in place to protect students from obscene or harmful online content in order to be eligible for discounts on internet access or internal connections through the Schools and Libraries Program of the [[Universal Service Fund]], commonly known as the [[E-Rate|E-Rate program]].&lt;ref name=CIPA&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act "Children's Internet Protection Act"], [http://www.fcc.gov/ http://www.fcc.gov], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of commercially available free and paid services that allow schools to meet CIPA requirements and receive the discount.

==Types of Filtering==

The FCC and CIPA do not specify how the filtering needs to be done, so most schools are using a combination of DNS, Browser and Firewall-based filtering.

=== DNS Filtering ===

The DNS filtering happens at the domain resolution layer of the Internet and does not allow the IP address of an obscene or harmful website to be discovered. There are multiple paid products that perform such work, but many schools are leveraging free solutions to filter non-safe sites.

===  Browser Filtering ===

Some Browser extensions allow parental control to be enabled to restrict non desirable websites categories. For CIPA, those categories include any website with adult-only content.

=== Firewall-based Filtering ===

Firewall-based filtering can be done at the IP layer or using Web proxies to intercept and filter HTTP and HTTPS requests to websites that are not kid safe. This type of solution is difficult to implement as much of the web is moving to HTTPS, so it does not have a high efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">A '''Wittgenstein's ladder''' is a simplified explanation of a technical or complex subject that is used as a teaching tool, despite being technically wrong.

The term stems from proposition number 6.54 in Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s 1921 philosophical work ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', in which he states that although his propositions are at some level incorrect, they can be used like steps on a ladder to help one reach an understanding of higher level concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/ |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Side-by-Side-by-Side Edition |publisher=People.umass.edu |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.}}&lt;ref&gt;Original in [[German language|German]]:
{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Meine Sätze erläutern dadurch, dass sie der, welcher mich versteht, am Ende als unsinnig erkennt, wenn er durch sie—auf ihnen—über sie hinausgestiegen ist. (Er muss sozusagen die Leiter wegwerfen, nachdem er auf ihr hinaufgestiegen ist.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Er muss diese Sätze überwinden, dann sieht er die Welt richtig.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers before Wittgenstein including [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Fritz Mauthner]] had used a similar metaphor before him.&lt;ref name=gakis&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wittgensteinrepository.org/agora-alws/article/view/2891/3506|title=Throwing Away the Ladder Before Climbing it|last=Gakis|first=Dimitris|work=Papers of the 33rd IWS (eds. E. Nemeth, R. Heinrich, W. Pichler)|volume=|issue=|page=|date=2010|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Wittgenstein rejected his own "ladder" idea, stating:&lt;ref name=gakis/&gt;

The term '''30 million word gap''' (often shortened to just the '''word gap''') was coined in a 2003 article by [[Betty Hart]] and [[Todd R. Risley]] titled "The Early Catastrophe: The 30 Million Word Gap by Age 3".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hart |first=Betty |last2=Risley |first2=Todd |date=2003 |title=The early catastrophe: The 30 million word gap by age 3 |url=http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf |journal=American Educator |pages=4–9 |accessdate=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley used LENA devices, an electronic microphone that measured how many words the child hears to record samples of the utterances of entire families over 2.5 years. Families were classified by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) into "high" (professional), "middle" (working class), and "low" (welfare) SES. They found that the average child in a professional family hears 2,153 words per waking hour, the average child in a working class family hears 1,251 words per hour, and an average child in a welfare family only 616 words per hour. Extrapolating, they stated that, "in four years, an average child in a professional family would accumulate experience with almost 45 million words, an average child in a working-class family 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family 13 million words."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The authors found a correlation between word exposure and the rate of [[vocabulary acquisition]] in the subject children. The recordings showed that high SES toddlers spoke approximately 2 new words a day between their second and third birthdays, middle SES children 1 word per day, and low SES children 0.5 words per day. Spoken words are a measure of [[Vocabulary#Productive and receptive knowledge|productive vocabulary]]. It is thought that during children's vocabulary development the productive vocabulary mirrors their underlying [[Vocabulary development|receptive vocabulary growth]].

The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap–or certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition–partially explains the [[achievement gap in the United States]], the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Valerie Strauss |title=The famous 'word gap' doesn't hurt only the young. It affects many educators, too. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/16/the-famous-word-gap-doesnt-hurt-only-the-young-it-affects-many-educators-too |work=Washington Post |location= |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics theorize that the language and achievement gaps are not a result of the amount of words a child is exposed to, but rather alternative theories suggest it could derive from the disconnect of linguistic practices between home and school. Thus, judging academic success and linguistic capabilities from socioeconomic may ignore bigger societal issues. The ongoing word gap discourse can be seen as a modern movement in educational discussion.

== History of language gap research ==

=== Before Hart &amp; Risley ===
Prior to the 30 million word gap study, extensive research had noted strong institutional variation in student success on standardized tests. The initial attention to achievement gap started with a 1966 publication from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] titled “Equality of Educational Opportunity.” The publication begins the onset of achievement gap by acknowledging that there is a great disparity within educational outcomes as a result of inequitable institutions, especially those that were not seen as part of the purview of schools such as cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic realities of students at home. The National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP) had further been used to census information that various studies used to show achievement gaps across a number of demographics. The idea of equity in education had also given rise to similar gap discourse around the world.

=== Hart &amp; Risley's contribution ===
Hart and Risley (2003) spent 2 ½ years observing 42 families for an hour each month to learn what typical home life was like for 1 and 2 year old children.  The families were grouped into 4 variables, upper SES, middle SES, lower SES and just a few that were on welfare. They found that by age 3 children in welfare families had a vocabulary of 525 words where children in upper SES families had vocabulary of 1,116 words. They also found that the children in upper class families were learning vocabulary at a faster rate. The researchers suggested the reason for this difference is because the welfare children heard on average 616 words per hour where professional-family children heard on average 2,153 words per hour. Thus, proposing the 30 Million Word Gap. The achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age.

=== Socioeconomic status studies ===
Fernald, Marchman, and Weisleder (2013) conducted a study with 48 children from diverse backgrounds ages 18–24 months old. The families were divided into low-SES (socioeconomic status) and high-SES.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning. Their second goal was to examine difference in aspects of early language development in relation to their SES. Their results showed that children at the same age from the lower class families had lower vocabulary scores when compared to children in higher class families. Fernald et al (2013) also found that by 18 months old language processing and vocabulary disparities were already evident, and by 24 months old there was a 6 month gap between the SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/desc.12019 |pmid=23432833 |pmc=3582035 |title=SES differences in language processing skill and vocabulary are evident at 18 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=234–48 |year=2013 |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne |last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A |last3=Weisleder |first3=Adriana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernald et al found fast reaction time as a child can translate into reaction time as an adult. Adults who have high reaction time tend to have better memories, reasoning abilities, language skills and are better able to learn new skills (fluid intelligence). Having better processing speed means having a stronger working memory, and a stronger working memory leads to a better cognitive competence. The authors express the importance of vocabulary knowledge because it sets a foundation for later literacy and language proficiency in preschool and that is predictive of academic success. Implications of long term developmental trajectories. Thus, the issue of the language gap and achievement gap are prevalent in our youth, which can be resolved by teaching families how to work and speak with their children.

=== Educational system studies ===
Sperry, Sperry, and Miller (2018) replicated Hart and Risley’s study and found that the amount of word gaps varied within the same backgrounds of socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A longitudinal study observed families with their children in their homes and the researchers spoke to the participants as if they were a family friend. They used similar social classes as HR for comparison. Middle class, working class, lower class, poor “welfare” group. During the visit, three analyses were made and transcribed for research. The first was how many words the primary caregiver spoke to the child. The second was that the words spoken by all caregivers to the child showed social class alone did not determine either the composition of households or consequently the amount of a speech a child heard. Lastly, all ambient speech, like language addressed to other individuals but overheard by language learning children was considered. In the poor community sample when you took into consideration the ambient speech, or the words that primary caregivers said to extended family, the amount of words a child hears increased by 54%, in the working class by 210%. This study was the first attempt to replicate Hart and Risley and their findings did not support the previous claims.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/cdev.13072 |title=Reexamining the Verbal Environments of Children from Different Socioeconomic Backgrounds |journal=Child Development |year=2018 |last1=Sperry |first1=Douglas E |last2=Sperry |first2=Linda L |last3=Miller |first3=Peggy J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the variation within communities was greater than when simply comparing socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) were interested in the origins and validity of the Language Gap, and how the preconceptions of it impact bilingual and bidialectical children, specifically from Latino and Black backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They focused more so on how people talk about and understand language as a whole, especially within the education system. Their argument claims language is a semiotic process that involves sound, touch, and gestures and should be seen as a translanguaging-internalist perspective.  She offers historical context to give insight to the creation of the Language Gap and the biases it may hold. They suggest it began when ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown vs The Board of Education]]'' (1954) and the [[Civil Rights Act]] (1964) made it illegal to judge based on one’s color or race; thus, exclusions needed to be made based on another trait. They build on Flores and Rosas (2017) idea of [[raciolinguistics]] that suggests a new way to separate whites and non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149 |title=Undoing Appropriateness: Raciolinguistic Ideologies and Language Diversity in Education |journal=Harvard Educational Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2015 |last1=Flores |first1=Nelson |last2=Rosa |first2=Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to give historical context on the Achievement Gap in that it was a result of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (2001), despite its good intentions, it compared every race and background on a standardized test written in a White monolingual way.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/19313152.2016.1258190 |title=Interrogating the Language Gap of Young Bilingual and Bidialectal Students |journal=International Multilingual Research Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=52–65 |year=2016 |last1=García |first1=Ofelia |last2=Otheguy |first2=Ricardo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the educational system functions on the dominant groups of society (i.e. white, Standardized English, middle-upper class), it ignores the linguistic and cultural practices of minorities. The theory here is that it is not that families of differing backgrounds are not adequate in teaching their children how to speak, but teach them a different linguistic culture at home than the one taught in schools.

Similarly, Johnson (2015) draws on from Faltis (2006) socialization mismatch hypothesis that the culture of the schooling system that is based around middle to upper class, White, Standardized English principles do not match the language socialization of backgrounds that may not fit into these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Faltis, C.F. (2005), ''Teaching English Language Learners in Elementary School Communities'' , Pearson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the Language Gap was not a result of vocabulary or literary deficiency in a child, but rather not understanding the language socialization of different cultural backgrounds. He drew from a previous linguistic anthropologist Hymes (1972) term of “communicative competence” in that social expectations within a speech community shape the member’s use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes, D. (1972), “On communicative competence”, in Pride, J.B. and Holmes, J. (Eds),''Sociolinguistics'' , Penguin, London, pp. 269-285.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diverse backgrounds in language have a different set of expectations that a member conforms to. As language differs, so does the developmental process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric J|year=2015|title=Debunking the 'language gap'|journal=Journal for Multicultural Education|volume=9|issue=1|pages=42–50|doi=10.1108/jme-12-2014-0044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (2015) argues the Language Gap is not fair because it does not consider the various ways children use words and create meaning. Therefore, it is not the parents at fault leading their children to fall behind, but the school’s fault for not accommodating to children’s backgrounds.Thus, the Language Gap is not a result of a child’s capabilities to understand, but a result of how a linear function of language ignores the needs of the various ways to make meaning.

== Implications ==

=== Social implications ===
There are possible social implications to Hart and Risley’s theories of the issue of the Language Gap in society. The first possible implication is that this Language Gap is affecting youth’s success because they are not exposed to the same amount of vocabulary and literary skill as other kids from middle-upper classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hart and Risely suggest that possible solutions include interventions on how to improve vocab and literary skills for caregivers in low SES. However, the second possible implication of this theory is that it ignores the fact that language and culture are taught differently. In stating other backgrounds cannot be as successful as the dominant groups in society, It reinstates the homogeneity of language, in that it proposes one “true” way of speaking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) implies the Language and Achievement Gap derive from racist ideals that reinforce the idea that some cultures are seen as “disadvantaged”. To place the blame on different backgrounds is to invalidate their way to make meaning just because they have different cultures. Thus, to not consider the responsibility of the schooling system is to promote the homogeneity of Standardized English and this notion that anyone who doesn’t speak or understand it is inferior and prone to future failure. Garcia argues it deligitimatizes backgrounds of families and their linguistic and cultural practices because it is not seen to be “successful” in the eyes of the education system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Political implications ===
Sperry, Sperry and Miller discussed some of the consequences of the original Hart and Risley (2003) article. The 30 Million Word Gap has received widespread media attention. In 2013 Bloomberg Philanthropies mayors challenge awarded providence Rhode Island its grand prize to “providence talks” - a project proposed to teach poor parents how to speak to their children with the aid of the LENA Device. The Clinton foundations “Too Small to Fail” initiative which hosted the White House Word Gap event in 2014, resulted in the US department of Health and Human services funding remedial efforts to address the Word Gap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, Georgia has a policy “Talk with Me Baby” that is a public action strategy aimed at increasing the number of words children are exposed to in early childhood. "Talk With Me Baby" is a program that provides professional development of nurses, who will then coach new parents how they should talk to their children. This program is funded by Greater United Way of Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The University of Chicago, School of Medicine's Thirty Million Words Initiative provides intervention for caregivers and teaches to show them how to optimize their talk with their kids. This program is funded by the PNC Foundation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shankar, M. (2014) Empowering our children by bridging the word gap. ''The White House President Barack Obama'' retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/06/25/empowering-our-children-bridging-word-gap&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gap discourse ===
The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the [[Achievement gap in the United States|Achievement Gap]] discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems  public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. ''Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient'' are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to [[James Paul Gee]]’s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis.&lt;ref name="Carey2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Roderick L|year=2013|title=A Cultural Analysis of the Achievement Gap Discourse|journal=Urban Education|volume=49|issue=4|pages=440–68|doi=10.1177/0042085913507459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the Achievement Gap Discourse cause several cultural phenomena- “cultural gate-keeping,” in which policy makers and education reformers decide and label students as more or less capable and worthy than others. Schools might be called under-performing, which can further affect the policy and financing prescribed by their districts, or even higher authorities.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt;

Using metric standards to understand the cause in Achievement Gap as a result of ineffective cultural practices also tends to place blame on the families unless there is ample socio-linguistic inquiry to individual family circumstance, which still often creates a Discourse against deemed underachieving students’ culture.

The Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). ''The gap Discourse'' does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st Century, pin-headed by the 30 million Word Gap. Among critics are many linguists, anthropologists, and social discipline specialists, as well as organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015" /&gt;

The achievement gap became an especially strong interest for study in the turn of the century, and the early 2000's when a plethora of studies looked at factors such as standardized test scores, presence in class, GPA, enrollment, and dropout rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The problem came in the analyses of the studies which were  criticized for looking at race and socioeconomic explanations to explain educational outcome without taking into account others such as S. J. Lee, 2005, Pang, Kiang, &amp; Pak, 2004, and Rothstein 2004 which provided broad postulations as to why race and SES accounted for varied success.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, V. O., Kiang, P. N., &amp; Pak, Y. K. (2004). Asian Pacific American students: Challenging a biased educational system. In J. A. Banks &amp; C. A. M. Banks (Eds.), Handbook of research on multicultural education (2nd ed., pp. 542-563). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, T. (2003). Up from the parched earth: Toward a theory of African American achievement. In T. Perry, C. Steele, &amp; A. G. Hilliard III (Eds.), Young, gifted and Black: Promoting high achievement among African-American students (pp. 1-108). Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. J. (2005). Up against whiteness: Race, school and immigrant youth. New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; President George W. Bush's administration’s [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] rhetoric of 2001 and 2002 left researchers limited to the type of research they could conduct for educational equity due to a need to appease policy makers among educational stakeholders. According to Roderick L Carey, Word Gap researcher, the NCLB “mandated objective and quantitative ‘scientifically based’ research, which left little room for qualitative research agendas that unpack contextual factors that add nuance to the understandings of how high-stakes accountability is felt and lived by students, teachers, and their families.”&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The rhetoric also posed ideas that placed responsibility of achievement in institutions on their most proximal function oriented members, shifting responsibility to achieve positive outcomes on high-stakes standardized tests nearly entirely on teachers and schools, whilst the difference in achievement was largely believed to be due to factors outside of the classroom. Various studies culminated to suggest general and vague underlying problems within specific communities which caused deficit in learning outcomes under this context.

Among these studies, Hart and Risley  stumbled upon the idea of word gap when working with youth who used cochlear implants, to form their the idea: they hypothesized exposure to spoken word might explain an achievement gap in standardized test scores, then used standardized testing data on language as well as an in depth study to conclude their 30 million word gap publication.

== Additional information ==

=== Word Gap internationally ===
The ''Oxford Word Gap'' is used to describe the word gap found between races and socioeconomic classes in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The report study “Why Closing the Word Gap Matters: Oxford Language Report” details out statistics collected in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom, along the same ideas as the American Word Gap idea, citing ''Hart and Risley (2003)'' in the report. It was published in 2018, so all of its implications are yet to be seen.

A great number of states have paid attention to Achievement Gap across hundreds of criteria including demographics, access to language and economic resources and race around the world: notably in the United Kingdom, France, South Africa as named in one comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fulcher |first1=Taylor J. |title=A Comparative Analysis of the Racial and Class Achievement Gap in Schooling in the United States, France, and South Africa |year=2015 |series=Senior Honors Projects |volume=108 |url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/honors201019/108 |type=Thesis }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has held strongly in its principles the importance on aspects of educational equity, and other educational movements similar to that of the United States Word Gap are numerous throughout Europe and some other members of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14664208.2014.979649 |title=Language rights and language policy: Addressing the gap(s) between principles and practices |journal=Current Issues in Language Planning |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=355–9 |year=2014 |last1=May |first1=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe also has its own varied standards on the ideas of multilingual competence per state, which stress the apprehension and exposure to secondary language vocabulary in students of all ages.

=== Other Word Gaps ===
The Word Gap has largely been defined to mean the idea of the observed gap between the spoken and read language in the specific context of American education reform described in this article, however other proposed ideas or active research have used it to describe differences in access to language varieties experienced in public settings, such as signage in Orellana, 2017's ''Another Type of Word Gap'', as well as other linguistic resources such as using media for language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana, M. F. (2017, December 07). A Different Kind of Word Gap. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-faulstich-orellana/a-different-kind-of-word-_b_10030876.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of linguistic resource studies could change the language or may attempt to use terms to remain distinct from the stigma of word gap.
