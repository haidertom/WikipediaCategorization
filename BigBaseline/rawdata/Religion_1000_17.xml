'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

[[Image:JO200109337.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The 2001 '''About-Picard law''' [abu pika:r] (named after French parliament members [[Nicolas About]] and [[Catherine Picard]]), a controversial piece of [[France|French]] legislation, broadly speaking, makes it possible to act against organisations (legal entities) when such organisations have become involved in certain crimes. The law, in its own words, aimed at movements deemed cultic (''mouvements sectaires'') that "undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms".  The law has caused controversy internationally, with some commentators alleging that it infringes [[religious freedom]] while proponents content it reinforces religious freedom.

==Background on Government and Religion in France ==
:{{Main|Status of religious freedom in France}}

[[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the [[French Revolution]] and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Separation of religion and state in France takes the form of ''[[laïcité]]'', by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand "freedom of religion" primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not to believe what any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the [[Catholic Church]]), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the wake of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] murders and suicides, the [[French National Assembly|French Parliament]] established the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] to investigate cults. In December 1995 the Commission delivered a report on cults which caused much controversy, some of it due to a list extracted from a report by the [[French National Police]] on purported cults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp
&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission assimilated information and analysis from the French police secret service, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]].)

Following the recommendations of the report, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] set up in 1996 the "Interministerial board of observation of sects", followed in 1998 by the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects" ([[Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes|MILS]]). In 2002 the "Interministerial Monitoring Mission Against Sectarian Abuses" ([[MIVILUDES]]) replaced MILS.

Other action of the French government against potential abuses by cults resulted in the passing of the About-Picard law.

== The About-Picard law==

Commentators often refer to the Law 2001-504 of June 12, 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9903887L    &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021114222634/http://religionandpolicy.org/show.php?p=1.1.105 approximate translation into English]&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the About-Picard law, from the name of its ''[[rapporteur]]s'' (parliamentarians who report upon the draft law), [[French Senate|senator]] [[Nicolas About]] ([[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]] center-right party)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.fr/rap/l99-131/l99-131.html
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Catherine Picard]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]] center-left party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208022636/http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |archivedate=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parliament adopted the law with broad cross-party support under the government of center-right president [[Jacques Chirac]] and socialist prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].

'''Article 223-15-2 of Penal code:'''&lt;br /&gt;(Act no. 2001-504 of 12 June 2001, article 10 Official Journal of 13 June 2001 ; Ordinance No. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, article 3 Official Journal of 22 September 2000, into force 1 January 2002) 
       
« Fraudulently abusing the ignorance or state of weakness of a minor, or of a person whose particular vulnerability, due to age, sickness, infirmity, to a physical or psychological disability or to pregnancy, is apparent or known to the offender, or abusing a person in a state of physical or psychological dependency resulting from serious or repeated pressure or from techniques used to affect his judgement, in order to induce the minor or other person to act or abstain from acting in any way seriously harmful to him, is punished by three years' imprisonment and a fine of € 375,000.
Where the offence is committed by the legal or de facto manager of a group that carries out activities the aim or effect of which is to create, maintain or exploit the psychological or physical dependency of those who participate in them, the penalty is increased to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of € 750,000. »

The additional penalties that natural or legal persons may incur are mentioned in the following articles 223-15-3 and 4.

===Main points ===
Notable new points introduced by the law include:
* In the case of certain crimes, the law extends legal responsibility from individuals to organizations (corporations, associations, and other [[Juristic person|legal entities]]...).
* Courts can order the dissolution of organizations if they or their executives have been found guilty of these crimes.
 
The initial draft of the About-Picard law included the criminalization of "mental manipulation". Many organizations criticised this clause for its vagueness.  [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Élisabeth Guigou]] pushed for the removal of this clause, which the legislators excluded from the final version of the law. However, the law makes it a crime to defraud a person weakened by illness, old age, etc., but also of a person in a state of ''psychological or physical subjection resulting from grave or reiterated pressures or techniques able to alter judgement''.

=== Application of the law ===
There was one famous application of the law since its adoption: that of [[Arnaud Mussy]], leader of the tiny ''Néo-Phare'' (New Lighthouse) cult. Mussy, who claims that he is the [[Christ]], had announced imminent [[apocalypse]], resulting in the suicide of one of his followers and the attempted suicides of two others, who were severely wounded in 2001. The criminal court in Nantes sentenced him to three years in prison and 90,000 [[French Franc|FF]] damages in November 2004. It ruled that he had "abused fraudulently the state of ignorance and weakness of several persons in the state of bodily or mental dependence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0506.htm#6a&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court in Rennes confirmed the sentence in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0507.htm#12
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Law ==
:''See [[Status of religious freedom in France]] for expressed concerns about other aspects of French policies with respect to minority religions.''

The French government, when challenged on issues of religious discrimination, states that it has no concern in any way with religious doctrine ''per se''. The government has taken the position that it will deal with the concrete consequences of cult affiliation, especially with respect to children. The government sees this as particularly important in the light of past abuse committed in some criminal cults, such as [[sexual slavery]] and [[mass suicide]].  According to government sources, none of the criteria listed in related government documents on sects discuss [[theology]]; they only focus on the actions and the methods of the groups.

Critics of the law see this as merely a semantic change &lt;!-- change from what? --&gt; and maintain that no empirical studies support claims of the use of techniques of coercive persuasion by NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theology.homestead.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions inside France ===
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in France#Complaints by minority religions and groups|l1=Status of religious freedom in France: Complaints by minority religions}}

The [[Bishop of Soissons]], [[Marcel Herriot]], defended the law on 25 June 2000 asserting it was necessary to protect by law persons, family, society and religions themselves from sects that are violating fundamental freedoms and human dignity.

Some groups claim that the Parliamentary Reports and the controversy surrounding the About-Picard law have created an unhealthy atmosphere, resulting in minority religious groups suffering from excessively strict, uneven, or even abusive discrimination in the application of other laws by local authorities. For example, the group ''Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience'' (Co-ordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience) requested the repeal of the law, asserting laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report has described this group as a partisan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella association of French [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sued the French government in the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] in case #53430/99, alleging that the publication of the parliamentary reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law infringed its civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=671525&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the application.

In other cases (#53934/00), the Court affirmed that the publication of a Parliamentary Report disparaging to some groups did not constitute an infringement of human rights, even though these groups were not given a [[legal recourse]] for the removal of their name from the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=682416&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149
&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights activists dubbed the law "un délit d'opinion" (a thought crime).&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by the Council of Europe ===

Forty different religious and human-rights groups submitted a petition to the [[Council of Europe]]'s Parliamentary Assembly. This petition led to a report (Report 9612 of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of Europe) containing an expert paper by Swiss professor Joseph Voyame, who concluded:
:''"On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not incompatible with the Council of Europe’s values."''
Voyame deduces that the law clearly responds to a need, that the measure of dissolution appears radical, but also effective and reliable, and that judicial guarantees surround it. He also discusses the title with its mentioning of "cultic groups", but comes to the conclusion that the uncertainty regarding the definition has little importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title is undeniably part of the [Act], but has no legislative authority in itself. Although it may be useful for the purposes of interpretation, it cannot be used in making a ruling that runs counter to a clear legal provision [...] As we will see, [Sections] 1, 19 and 20 of this [Act] identify the targeted incorporated organizations and groups with the greatest possible precision. It is these standard-setting texts that are decisive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discussed several objections regarding the word "secte" (cult):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the word ‘sect’ has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, the world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of groups both large and small, all with various beliefs and observances, which are not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true that among these groups are some which have committed criminal acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements is not enough to condemn all the rest (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The act for the most part simply reiterates existing provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2002, the Council of Europe passed a resolution inviting the Government of France to reconsider the About-Picard Law and to clarify certain terms in the law. It referred, however, to the Recommendation 1412 (1999) on the illegal activities of sects, where it had concluded that it was ''"essential to ensure that the activities of groups, whatever religious, esoteric or spiritual description they adopted, were in keeping with the principles of democratic societies and, in particular, the provisions of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."'' and it stated that ''"ultimately, should the case arise, it will be for the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and it alone, to say whether or not this law is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."'' .

=== Reactions outside of France===
In an open letter dated June 2000 to Alain Vivien about religious freedom in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rhodes]], Executive Director of the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We question ourselves how such a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible with the concept of tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alain Vivien responded: "[The IHFHR] seems today to have passed into the hands of [[Scientology|Scientologists]] and perhaps other transnational organizations". [[Aaron Rhodes]] then acknowledged that the Moscow office of the IHFHR had received funding from the [[Church of Scientology]] to print a leaflet about religious freedom in Russia, and voiced his astonishment at the charge. Rhodes voiced his embarrassment: "[...]for you and your fellow French citizens by your recourse to methods of denunciations and insinuations that remind us of those sometimes used by totalitarian and backward regimes."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Reaction of the government of the United States of America ====
Some groups sought the help of their governments to fight what they saw as religious intolerance in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/090500-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Church of Scientology]] utilised pressure groups against the French government, and had some success with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, which repeatedly brought the matter before the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193106/http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pastor [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], head of the French Protestant federation and himself a strong critic of the first draft of the law, the complaints originating in the United States concerning religious freedom in France were largely based on biased, poor information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an010521-20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newspaper article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; the French government considered American interference regarding religious freedom in France as unwarranted meddling by the US government in France's internal affairs. Paul Webster wrote that President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Clinton that religious freedom would no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, "in the light of what has been officially described as 'shocking' White House support for [[Church of Scientology|Scientologists]] and [[Unification Church|Moonies]]". The French government also described the  [[United States Congress]]'s introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally as "an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs". [[Alain Vivien]], former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), and the president of the ''Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales'' (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, "because they offer an indispensable source of [[campaign finance|political financing]]", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html "France to crack down on sects"], by Paul Webster; Wednesday June 14, 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The French did not alter their law following these requests; and the claims and actions of the US government regarding the religious situation in France largely ceased with the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.

Some critics of French legislation have voiced concerns that countries which do not have the same legal safeguards and constitutional rights as France may emulate this legislation. In the words of a US official:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064332/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet the law itself remains problematic not only because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to [[rule of law]] and human rights. Such a model serves only too well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 September 2006 the United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] released a report on religious freedom in France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This report noted that "The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice." It reported mostly anonymous concerns over repression of religious freedom in France, notably in regards to what the report referred to in one case as "cult groups", as well as the law banning religious symbols in schools, and rising anti-semitism in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chakravarti''' ([[Sanskrit]] [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=cakravartin&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3 चक्रवर्तिन्] ''cakravartin'', [[Pali]] ''cakkavattin'') {{bo|t=འཁོར་ལོས་སྒྱུར་བའི་རྒྱལ་པོ་ |w=khor los bsgyur ba'i rgyal po}},  is a [[Sanskrit]] term used to refer to an ideal universal ruler&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 81|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rules ethically and benevolently over the entire world.
{{Indo-Persian royal and noble ranks}}
Such a ruler's reign is called ''sarvabhauma''. The word is a [[bahuvrihi|bahuvrīhi]] compound word, figuratively meaning "whose wheels are moving", in the sense of "whose chariot is rolling everywhere without obstruction". It can also be analysed as an 'instrumental bahuvrīhi: "through whom the wheel is moving" in the meaning of "through whom the [[Dharmachakra]] ("Wheel of the [[Dharma]]) is turning" (most commonly used in Buddhism). The Tibetan word translates "monarch who controls by means of a wheel".

[[File:Indian_relief_from_Amaravati,_Guntur._Preserved_in_Guimet_Museum.jpg|thumb|Possibly [[Ashoka]] of [[Mauryan Empire]] at [[Guimet Museum]].]]
The first references to a ''Chakravala Chakravartin'' appear in monuments from the time of the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE), dedicated to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and his grandson [[Ashoka]]. In Buddhism, the Chakravarti came to be considered the secular counterpart of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. In general, the term applies to temporal as well as spiritual kingship and leadership, particularly in [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]] and Jainism. In [[Hinduism]], the term generally denotes a powerful ruler whose dominion extended to the entire earth.

== Hindu tradition ==

A history of the Imperial Guptas, p.137. Central Book Depot.&lt;/ref&gt; which also led to the Chakravartin Concept.&lt;ref name=begley65&gt;Wayne Edison Begley (1973).

New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; There are relatively few examples of chakravartins in both northern and southern India.

In Southern India, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava period]] beginning with Simhavishnu (575 CE{{Dash}}900 CE) was a transitional stage in southern Indian society with monument building, establishment of (bhakti) sects of [[Alvars]] and [[Nayanars]], flowering of rural Brahmanical institutions of Sanskrit learning, and the establishment of ''Chakravartin'' model of kingship over a territory of diverse people; which ended the pre-Pallavan era of territorially segmented people, each with their culture, under a tribal chieftain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] period extolled ranked relationships based on ritual purity as enjoined by the ''shastras''.&lt;ref name=stein&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton distinguishes between the ''Chakravatin'' model and the ''[[Kshatriya]]'' model, and likens kshatriyas to locally based warriors with ritual status sufficiently high enough to share with ''[[Brahmin]]s''; and states that in south India the kshatriya model did not emerge.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt; As per Burton, South India was aware of the Indo-Aryan ''Varna'' organized society in which decisive secular authority was vested in the ''Kshatriyas''; but apart from the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]], [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] line of warriors which claimed ''Chakravartin'' status, only few locality warrior families achieved the prestigious kin-linked organization of northern warrior groups.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

==Jain tradition==
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}

[[File:14 Ratna of Chakravartin.png|thumb|14 Ratnas of Chakravartin]]
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Salakapurusa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 12 Chakravartin regularly appear.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} The [[Jain cosmology]] or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. As per Jain cosmology, Chakravartins are ''Universal Monarchs'' or ''World Conquerors''. Golden in complexion, they all belonged to the ''[[Kasyapa]]'' [[gotra]]. The mother of a Chakravartin sees some dreams at the time of conception. A chakravartin is considered an ideal human being endowed with thirty-two major signs of excellence and many minor signs of excellence.

The list of 12 chakravartin of ''Avasarpini'' as per [[Jainism]] is as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Jagmanderlal |last=Jaini |title=Outlines of Jainism |editor=F.W. Thomas}} appendix III.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cakravarti King in Buddhism==
[[File:Mandala of the Six Chakravartins.JPG|thumb|Tibetan [[mandala]] of the six chakravartis]]
The concept of the cakravarti existed in Buddhism as well as in Jainism. The [[Early Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]'' (1.259f) and the ''[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]]'', as well as the [[Theravada|Theravadin]] [[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]], describe the marks of the cakravarti as ruler: {{IAST|[[Ushnisha|''uṣṇīṣa'']]}}, [[chhatra]] "parasol", "horn jewel" or [[vajra]], [[whisk]] and [[sandal]]s. These were the marks of the [[kshatriya]]. Plastic art of early [[Mahayana]] Buddhism illustrates [[bodhisattva]]s in a form called {{IAST|''uṣṇīṣin''}} "wearing a turban/hair binding", wielding the mudras for "nonviolent cakravarti rule".&lt;ref name=Falk&gt;Falk, Harry, "Small-Scale Buddhism" in {{cite book|editor1-last=Voegeli|editor1-first=François|editor2-last=Eltschinger|editor2-first=Vincent|editor3-last=Candotti|editor3-first=Maria Piera|editor4-last=Diaconescu|editor4-first=Bogdan|editor5-last=Kulkarni|editor5-first=Malhar|title=Devadattīyam : Johannes Bronkhorst felicitation volume|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Bern|isbn=9783034306829}}, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cakravarti King is a king who rules all of the great continents (Pubbavideha, Jambudipa, 
Aparagoyana, Uttarakuru) of earth. The King wins all of the continents with peace. Since he's virtuous, seven miracle treasures appear including a large wheel spinning (Chakraratnaya) in the sky. King and his army can travel anywhere with that spinning wheel in the sky. He travels over the world and teaches all kings how to rule with peace [[Dasavidha-rājadhamma]]. He can travel to the lower heaven realms with the power of Chakraratnaya if he wants. Cakravarti king only appears when humans are virtuous and long lived. [[Jataka tales]] a part of the [[Pali Canon]] describe Buddhist Cakravarti Kings.

Under the '''[[Ottoman Empire]]''''s [[millet system]], Christians and Jews were considered ''[[dhimmi]]'' (meaning "protected") under [[Ottoman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Millet system - Oxford Reference| accessdate = 2017-11-18| url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199290543.001.0001/acref-9780199290543-e-1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-0-85771-757-3| last = Kieser| first = Hans-Lukas| title = Turkey Beyond Nationalism: Towards Post-Nationalist Identities| date = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Christians]] were the largest non-Muslim group. With the rise of [[Imperial Russia]], the Russians became a kind of protector of the Orthodox Christians in
the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Peace Treaties and International Law in European History: from the late Middle Ages to World War One, Randall. Lesaffer, 2004, p.357&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion to Islam in the Ottoman Empire involved a combination of individual, family, communal and institutional initiatives and motives. The process was also influenced by the balance of power between the Ottomans and the neighboring Christian states.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt; However, most Ottoman subjects in Eastern Europe remained Orthodox Christian, such as [[Wallachia]], [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Ottoman Greece|Greece]] while present-day [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] had larger Muslim populations as a result of Ottoman influence.

==Civil status==
Ottoman religious tolerance was notable for being a bit better than that which existed elsewhere in other great past or contemporary empires, such as Spain or England {{dubious|date=November 2017}}. By the Byzantine Empire, apart from during the time of Theodosius, generally did not condemn other religious groups either, there being a mosque built in Constantinople, a Latin Quarter filled with Roman Catholic Churches and even a synagogue. Of course, there were isolated instances of gaps between established policy and its actual practical application, but still, it was the mode of operation of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;G. Georgiades Arnakis, "The Greek Church of Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire", ''The Journal of Modern History'' '''24''':3. (Sep., 1952), p. 235 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1875481?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102533984363 JSTOR], archived [https://www.scribd.com/doc/156506983/Arnakis-The-Greek-Church-of-Constantinople-and-the-Ottoman-Empire here]&lt;/ref&gt;
Lewis and Cohen point out that until relatively modern times, tolerance in the treatment of non-believers, at least as it is understood in the West after [[John Locke]], was neither valued, nor its absence condemned by both Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1995) p. 211, Cohen (1995) p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ottoman rule, [[dhimmi]]s (non-Muslim subjects) were allowed to "practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy" (see: [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]) and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984) pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt; While recognizing the inferior status of dhimmis under Islamic rule, [[Bernard Lewis]], Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], states that, in most respects, their position was "very much easier than that of non-Christians or even of heretical Christians in medieval (Catholic) Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984) p. 62, Cohen (1995) p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dhimmis rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and with certain exceptions, they were free in their choice of residence and profession.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999) p.131&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is understood that Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state where the non-Muslims were inferior. There were strict divisions between religions which prevented integration.&lt;ref&gt;Todorova Maria, "The Ottoman Legacy in the Balkans", in Carl L. Brown (ed.), ''Imperial Legacy: The Ottoman Imprint on the Balkans and the Middle East'', New York, 1996, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative attitudes towards dhimmis harbored by the Ottoman governors were partly due to the "normal" feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups, to the contempt Muslims had for those whom they perceived to have willfully chosen to refuse to accept the truth and convert to Islam, and to certain specific prejudices and humiliations. The negative attitudes, however, rarely had any ethnic or racial components.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984) p. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the Ottoman Empire decreed that people of different [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]] should wear specific colors of, for instance, turbans and shoes — a policy that was not, however, always followed by Ottoman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 20–21 {{Nonspecific|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion as an Ottoman institution==
[[Image:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]] receives [[Gennadius II Scholarius]] ([[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1454 to 1464)]]

The Ottoman Empire constantly formulated policies balancing its religious problems. The Ottomans recognized the concept of [[clergy]] and its associated extension of religion as an institution. They brought established policies (regulations) over religious institutions through the idea of "legally valid" organizations.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} But all had to accept Islam as dominant, and could not criticize Islam or the Sultan. To do so invited execution.

The state's relationship with the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] was mixed, since the Orthodox were not killed, they were in the beginning the vast majority and taxpayers, they were encouraged through bribes and exemptions to convert to Islam. In turn they could not proselytize Muslims. The church's structure was kept intact and largely left alone (but under close control and scrutiny) until the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1821–1831 and, later in the 19th and early 20th centuries, during the rise of the Ottoman [[constitutional monarchy]], which was driven to some extent by nationalistic currents. But the Church was greatly affected by the corruption brought in by the Ottoman system of choosing the Patriarch of Constantinople, and putting up the position of Patriarch for bribes. Other churches, like the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] (1766) and [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]] (1767), were dissolved and their dioceses placed under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Churches had to be placed in inconspicuous areas, where the everyday populace would not see them.

Eventually, [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]] (contracts with European powers) were negotiated, [[Protectorate of missions|protecting the religious rights of Christians]] within the Empire. The [[Russian Empire|Russians]] became formal protectors of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] groups in 1774, the [[France|French]] of the Catholics, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] of the Jews and other groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rienner.com/uploads/53e278dea4631.pdf|title=Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: The Abridged Edition|last=Braude|first=Benjamin|date=2014|website=Lynne Rienner Publishers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conversion===

Conversion to Islam in the Ottoman Empire involved a combination of individual, family, communal and institutional initiatives and motives. The process was also influenced by the balance of power between the Ottomans and the neighboring Christian states.&lt;ref name=krstic&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5x8XD66bUAhWEu48KHZwuBJcQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|chapter="Conversion"|author=Tijana Krstić|title=''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire''|editor= Ed. Gábor Ágoston and Bruce Alan Masters|publisher=InfoBase Publishing|year=2009|pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is insufficient documentation of the process of conversion to Islam in Anatolia before the mid-15th century. By that time it was about 85% complete according to an Ottoman census, although in lagged in some regions such as [[Trabzon]]. In the Balkans, the general trend of conversion started slowly in the 14th century, reached its peak in the 17th century, and gradually petered out by the end of the 18th century, with significant regional variations.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt;

The earliest converts to Islam came from the ranks of the Balkan nobility and military elites, who helped the Ottomans administer their native provinces. Although conversion was not required to obtain these posts, over time these local ruling elites tended to adopt Islam. Some scholars view proselyting Sufi mystics and the Ottoman state itself as important agents of conversion among broader populations. Other scholars argue that intermarriage and professional patronage networks were the most important factors of religious transformation of the broader society.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt; According to [[Halil İnalcık]], the wish to avoid paying the jizya was an important incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, while Anton Minkov has argued that it was only one among several motivating factors.&lt;ref name="Tramontana"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tramontana | first=Felicita | title=The Poll Tax and the Decline of the Christian Presence in the Palestinian Countryside in the 17th Century | journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=56 | issue=4-5 | year=2013 | pages=631–652 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685209-12341337 | doi=10.1163/15685209-12341337 | ref=harv | accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 14th to the mid-17th century, the Ottomans pursued a policy of imposing a levy of male children (''[[devşirme]]'') on their Christian subjects in the Balkans with the goal of supplying the Ottoman state with capable soldiers and administrators. The compulsory conversion to Islam which these boys underwent as part of their education is the only documented form of [[forced conversion]] carried out by the Ottoman state.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt;

According to Islamic law, religion of the children was automatically changed after their parents converted. Many families collectively converted and their petitions as per Islamic customs for monetary help to the Ottoman Imperial Council are known. As marriages between non-Muslim men and Muslim women were forbidden under Sharia law, the refusal of husband to convert to Islam resulted in a divorce and the wife gaining custody of the children. Seventeenth-century sources indicate that non-Muslim women throughout the empire used this method to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt;

The Ottomans tolerated [[Protestant]] missionaries within their realm, so long as they limited their [[proselytising]] to the Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;The Crimean war: A holy war of an unusual kind: A war in which two Christian countries fighting a third claimed Islam as their ally, [[The Economist]], September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing influence of Western powers and Russia in the 18th century, the process of conversion slowed down, and the Ottomans were pressured to turn a blind eye to re-conversion of many of their subjects to Christianity, although apostasy was prohibited under penalty of death according to Islamic law and the Ottomans had punished it strictly in earlier centuries.&lt;ref name=krstic/&gt;

==Religion and the legal system==
The main idea behind the Ottoman legal system was the "[[confessional community]]". The Ottomans tried to leave the choice of religion to the individual rather than imposing forced classifications. However, there were grey areas.

Ottoman practice assumed that law would be applied based on the religious beliefs of its citizens. However, the Ottoman Empire was organized around a system of local [[jurisprudence]]. Legal administration fit into a larger schema balancing central and local authority.&lt;ref name="Colonial1"&gt;Lauren A. Benton “Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400-1900” pp.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;  The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire aimed to facilitate the integration of culturally and religiously different groups.&lt;ref name="Colonial1"/&gt;

There were three court systems: one for Muslims, another for non-Muslims ([[dhimmi]]s), involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, capital offences, or threats to public order. Christians were liable in a non-Christian court in specific, clearly defined instances, for example the assassination of a Muslim or to resolve a trade dispute.

The Ottoman judicial system institutionalized a number of biases against non-Muslims, such as barring non-Muslims from testifying as witnesses against Muslims. At the same time, non-Muslims "did relatively well in adjudicated interfaith disputes", because anticipation of judicial biases prompted them to settle most conflicts out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kuran, T., &amp; Lustig, S.|year=2012|title=Judicial biases in Ottoman Istanbul - Islamic justice and its compatibility with modern economic life|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=55|pages=631–666|registration=yes |jstor=665537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ottoman Empire of the 18th and 19th centuries, dhimmis frequently used the Muslim courts not only when their attendance was compulsory (for example in cases brought against them by Muslims), but also in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were brought against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi’s own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance to Muslim courts so that they would be decided under shari'a law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis’ beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;al-Qattan (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian sources points that although Christians were not Muslims, there were instances which they were subjected to shari'a law.&lt;ref&gt;A Concise History of Bulgaria, Richard J. Crampton, 2005, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; According to some western sources, "the testimony of a Christian was not considered as valid in the Muslim court as much as the testimony of a Muslim". In a Muslim court, a Christian witness had a problem of building trust; a Christian who took a "Muslim oath" over the [[Koran]] ("God is Allah and there is no other God"), committed perjury.

==Persecution==
[[File:1895erzurum-victims.jpg|thumb|A photograph taken of the Hamidian Massacres, 1895. It is estimated that between 200,000 - 300,000 Christians lost their lives]]
The Ottoman Empire's treatment of its Christian subjects varied during its history. During the golden age of the empire, the millet system promised its Christian subjects better treatment than non-Christian populations experienced in Christian Europe, while during the decline and fall of the empire, the Christian minorities suffered a number of atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George A. Bournoutian|authorlink=George Bournoutian|title=A Concise History of the Armenian People|publisher=Mazda Publishers|edition=5th|year=2006|page=191|quote=At its best, during the Ottoman golden age, the millet system promised non-Muslims fairer treatment than conquered or non-Christian subjects enjoyed under the Europeans. At its worst, during the decline and fall of the empire, the Christian minorities were subjected to extortion and pogroms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cases of persecution include the [[Batak massacre]], the [[Hamidian massacres]], the [[Adana massacre]], the ethnic cleansing of [[Thracian Bulgarians]] in 1913 and the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]] and [[Assyrian Genocide]], all of which occurred during the last few decades of the empire under the influence of [[Pan-Turkism#Criticism|Pan-Turkism]].

==''Devşirme''==
{{see also|Christian tattooing in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Beginning with [[Murad I]] in the 14th century and extending through the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire employed ''[[Devshirmeh|devşirme]]'' (دوشيرم), a kind of tribute or conscription system where young Christian boys were taken from communities in the Balkans, enslaved and converted to Islam and later employed either in the [[Janissary]] military corps or the Ottoman administrative system. The most promising students were enrolled in the [[Enderun School]], whose graduates would fill the higher positions. Most of the children collected were from the Empire's Balkan territories, where the ''devşirme'' system was referred to as the "blood tax". When the children ended up becoming Islamic due to the milieu in which they were raised, any children that they had were considered to be free Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Kjeilen, Tore. "[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/devsirme.htm Devsirme]," ''Encyclopaedia of the Orient''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
{{see also|Taxation in the Ottoman Empire}}
Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis was "a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes"&lt;ref name="Cahen"&gt;Cl.

==Religious architecture==
The Ottoman Empire regulated how its cities would be built (quality assurances) and how the architecture (structural integrity, social needs, etc.) would be shaped.

Prior to the [[Tanzimat]] (a period of reformation beginning in 1839), special restrictions were imposed concerning the construction, renovation, size and the bells in Orthodox churches. For example, an Orthodox church's [[bell tower]] had to be slightly shorter than the [[minaret]] of the largest [[mosque]] in the same city. [[Hagia Photini]] in [[İzmir]] was a notable exception, as its bell tower was the tallest landmark of the city by far. They also must not exceed in grandeur or elegance. Only some churches were allowed to be built, but this was considered suspect, and some churches even fell into disrepair.

The majority of churches were destroyed or converted over time by the Ottoman Empire. Some others - notably the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Chora Church]], [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotonda]], and [[Hagios Demetrios]] - were converted into mosques (this was the majority). Indeed, Chora Church is the only church left with most of its mosaics still intact. Most of the churches in Turkey date now from the 19th century or 18th, like the small Patriarchate of Constantinople. Only Mary of the Mongols has continued to be a church. Many of the relics, icons, bells, etc., from the Byzantine Empire have been lost forever.

'''Clergy''' are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain [[religion]]s.  The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's [[doctrine]]s and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are ''clergyman'', ''clergywoman'' and ''churchman''. Less common terms are ''churchwoman'', ''clergyperson'' and ''cleric''.

In [[Christianity]] the specific names and roles of clergy vary by [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including [[deacon]]s, elders, [[priest]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[preacher]]s, [[pastor]]s, [[Religious minister|minister]]s and the [[Pope]]. In [[Islam]], a religious leader is often known formally or informally as an [[imam]], [[qadi]], [[mufti]], [[mullah]] or [[ayatollah]]. In Jewish tradition, a religious leader is often a [[rabbi]] (teacher) or [[hazzan]] (cantor).

== Etymology ==
The word "Cleric" comes from the [[ecclesiastical Latin]] ''Clericus'', for those belonging to the priestly class. In turn, the source of the Latin word is from the [[Ecclesiastical Greek]] ''Clericus'', meaning appertaining to an inheritance, in reference to the fact that the [[Levitical]] priests of the [[Old Testament]] had no inheritance except the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cleric
|title=cleric |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clergy" is from two [[Old French]] words, ''clergié'' and ''clergie'', which refer to those with learning and derive from [[Medieval Latin]] ''clericatus'', from [[Late Latin]] ''clericus'' (the same word from which "cleric" is derived).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clergy
|title=clergy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clerk", which used to mean one ordained to the ministry, also derives from ''clericus''. In the Middle Ages, reading and writing were almost exclusively the domain of the priestly class, and this is the reason for the close relationship of these words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clerk
|title=clerk |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Christianity]], especially in [[Eastern Christianity]] and formerly in Western [[Roman Catholicism]], the term ''cleric'' refers to any individual who has been ordained, including [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[bishop]]s.&lt;ref name=cathenc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04049b.htm Cleric] - ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Roman Catholicism]], the [[tonsure]] was a prerequisite for receiving any of the [[minor orders]] or [[major orders]] before the tonsure, [[minor orders]], and the [[subdiaconate]] were abolished following the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, Apostolic letter ''motu proprio'' ''Ministeria quaedam'' nos. 2–4, 64 AAS 529 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the clerical state is tied to reception of the diaconate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ministeria quaedam'' no. 1; CIC Canon 266 §&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minor Orders]] are still given in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and those who receive those orders are 'minor clerics.'&lt;ref&gt;CCEO Canon 327; George Nedungatt, ''Clerics'', ''in'' A Guide to the Eastern Code 255, 260 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "Cleric" is also appropriate for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] minor clergy who are tonsured in order not to trivialize orders such as those of Reader in the [[Eastern Church]], or for those who are tonsured yet have no minor or major orders. It is in this sense that the word entered the Arabic language, most commonly in Lebanon from the French, as ''kleriki'' (or, alternatively, ''cleriki'') meaning "[[seminarian]]." This is all in keeping with Eastern Orthodox concepts of clergy, which still include those who have not yet received, or do not plan to receive, the diaconate.

A priesthood is a body of [[priest]]s, [[shaman]]s, or [[oracle]]s who have special religious authority or function. The term priest is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[presbyter]] (πρεσβύτερος, ''presbýteros'', elder or senior), but is often used in the sense of [[Sacerdotalism|sacerdos]] in particular, i.e., for clergy performing [[ritual]] within the sphere of the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] or [[numinous]] communicating with the [[gods]] on behalf of the community.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Bhikkhu}}
[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso in 2007]]
[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clergy are often collectively referred to as the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and consist of various orders of male and female monks (originally called [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s respectively). This diversity of monastic orders and styles was originally one community founded by [[Gautama Buddha]] during the 5th century BC living under a common set of rules (called the [[Vinaya]]). According to scriptural records, these celibate monks and nuns in the time of the Buddha lived an austere life of meditation, living as wandering beggars for nine months out of the year and remaining in retreat during the rainy season (although such a unified condition of [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]] is questioned by some scholars). However, as Buddhism spread geographically over time - encountering different cultures, responding to new social, political, and physical environments - this single form of Buddhist monasticism diversified. The interaction between Buddhism and Tibetan [[Bon]] led to a uniquely [[Tibetan Buddhism]], within which various sects, based upon certain teacher-student lineages arose. Similarly, the interaction between Indian Buddhist monks (particularly of the Southern [[Madhyamika]] School) and Chinese [[Confucian]] and [[Taoist]] monks from c200-c900AD produced the distinctive [[Ch'an]] Buddhism. Ch'an, like the Tibetan style, further diversified into various sects based upon the transmission style of certain teachers (one of the most well known being the 'rapid enlightenment' style of [[Linji Yixuan]]), as well as in response to particular political developments such as the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] and the Buddhist persecutions of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]. In these ways, manual labour was introduced to a practice where monks originally survived on alms; layers of garments were added where originally a single thin robe sufficed; etc. This adaptation of form and roles of Buddhist monastic practice continued after the transmission to Japan. For example, monks took on administrative functions for the Emperor in particular secular communities (registering births, marriages, deaths), thereby creating Buddhist 'priests'. Again, in response to various historic attempts to suppress Buddhism (most recently during the [[Meiji Era]]), the practice of celibacy was relaxed and Japanese monks allowed to marry. This form was then transmitted to [[Korea]], during later Japanese occupation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Buddhism#Buddhism during Japanese colonial rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; where celibate and non-celibate monks today exist in the same sects. (Similar patterns can also be observed in Tibet during various historic periods multiple forms of monasticism have co-existed such as "[[ngagpa]]" lamas, and times at which celibacy was relaxed). As these varied styles of Buddhist monasticism are transmitted to Western cultures, still more new forms are being created.

In general, the [[Mahayana]] schools of Buddhism tend to be more culturally adaptive and innovative with forms, while [[Theravada]] schools (the form generally practised in [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Sri Lanka]]) tend to take a much more conservative view of monastic life, and continue to observe precepts that forbid monks from touching women or working in certain secular roles. This broad difference in approach led to a major schism among Buddhist monastics in about the 4th century BCE, creating the [[Early Buddhist Schools]].

While female monastic (''[[bhikkhuni]]'') lineages existed in most Buddhist countries at one time, the [[Theravada]] lineages of Southeast Asia died out during the 14th-15th Century AD. As there is some debate about whether the bhikkhuni lineage (in the more expansive Vinaya forms) was transmitted to Tibet, the status and future of female Buddhist clergy in this tradition is sometimes disputed by strict adherents to the Theravadan style. Some Mahayana sects, notably in the United States (such as [[San Francisco Zen Center]]) are working to reconstruct the female branches of what they consider a common, interwoven lineage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfzc.org/sp_download/liturgy/35_Names_of_Women_Ancestors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of Buddhist traditions makes it difficult to generalize about Buddhist clergy. In the United States, [[Pure Land]] priests of the Japanese diaspora serve a role very similar to Protestant ministers of the Christian tradition. Meanwhile, reclusive Theravada forest monks in Thailand live a life devoted to meditation and the practice of austerities in small communities in rural Thailand- a very different life from even their city-dwelling counterparts, who may be involved primarily in teaching, the study of scripture, and the administration of the nationally organized (and government sponsored) Sangha. In the Zen traditions of China, Korea and Japan, manual labor is an important part of religious discipline; meanwhile, in the Theravada tradition, prohibitions against monks working as laborers and farmers continue to be generally observed.

Currently in North America, there are both celibate and non-celibate clergy in a variety of Buddhist traditions from around the world. In some cases they are forest dwelling monks of the Theravada tradition and in other cases they are married clergy of a Japanese Zen lineage and may work a secular job in addition to their role in the Buddhist community. There is also a growing realization that traditional training in ritual and meditation as well as philosophy may not be sufficient to meet the needs and expectations of American lay people. Some communities have begun exploring the need for training in counseling skills as well. Along these lines, at least two fully accredited Master of Divinity programs are currently available: one at Naropa University in Boulder, CO and one at the University of the West in Rosemead, CA.

==Christianity==
{{main article|Minister (Christianity)}}
In general, Christian clergy are [[ordained]]; that is, they are set apart for specific [[Catholic ministry|ministry]] in religious rites. Others who have definite roles in worship but who are not ordained (e.g. [[Laity|laypeople]] acting as [[acolytes]]) are generally not considered clergy, even though they may require some sort of official approval to exercise these ministries.

Types of clerics are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. An archbishop is not a distinct type of cleric, but is simply a bishop who occupies a particular position with special authority. Conversely, a youth minister at a [[parish]] may or may not be a cleric. Different churches have different systems of clergy, though churches with similar [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]] have similar systems.

===Anglicanism===
{{main article|Anglican ministry}}
[[File:IEAB 2006 mauricio saulo crosier.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bishop Maurício Andrade, [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], gives the [[crosier]] to Bishop Saulo Barros.]]
In [[Anglicanism]], clergy consist of the orders of [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s (presbyters) and [[bishop]]s in ascending order of seniority. ''[[Canon (priest)|Canon]]'', ''[[archdeacon]]'', ''[[archbishop]]'' and the like are specific positions within these orders. Bishops are typically overseers, presiding over a [[diocese]] composed of many [[parish]]es, with an archbishop presiding over a [[province]], which is a group of dioceses. A [[parish]] (generally a single church) is looked after by one or more priests, although one priest may be responsible for several parishes. New clergy are ordained deacons. Those seeking to become priests are usually ordained priest after a year. Since the 1960s some Anglican churches have reinstituted the diaconate as a permanent, rather than transitional, order of ministry focused on ministry that bridges the church and the world, especially ministry to those on the margins of society.

For the forms of address for Anglican clergy, see [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom]].

For a short period of history before the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops began within Anglicanism they could be "deaconesses". Although they were usually considered having a ministry distinct from deacons they often had similar ministerial responsibilities.

In Anglican churches all clergy are permitted to marry. In most national churches women may become deacons or priests, but while fifteen out of 38 national churches allow for the consecration of women as bishops, only five have ordained any. Celebration of the [[Eucharist]] is reserved for priests and bishops.

National Anglican churches are presided over by one or more [[primate (bishop)|primates]] or [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] (archbishops or presiding bishops). The senior archbishop of the [[Anglican Communion]] is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who acts as leader of the [[Church of England]] and 'first among equals' of the primates of all Anglican churches.

Being a deacon, priest or bishop is considered a function of the person and not a job. When priests retire they are still priests even if they no longer have any active ministry. However, they only hold the basic rank after retirement. Thus a retired archbishop can only be considered a bishop (though it is possible to refer to 'Bishop John Smith, the former Archbishop of York'), a canon or archdeacon is a priest on retirement and does not hold any additional honorifics.

=== Catholicism ===
{{See also|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Deacon}}
[[File:Belgische Bisschoppen.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop]] Karl-Josef Rauber, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Godfried Danneels]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] [[Roger Vangheluwe]] and Bishop [[Jozef De Kesel]]]]
[[Holy Orders|Ordained]] clergy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are either deacons, priests, or bishops belonging to the diaconate, the presbyterate, or the episcopate, respectively. Among bishops, some are [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]], [[archbishop]]s, or [[patriarch]]s. The [[Pope]] is the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], the supreme and universal hierarch of the Church, and his authorization is now required for the ordination of all Catholic bishops. With rare exceptions, [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] are bishops, although it was not always so; formerly, some cardinals were people who had received [[clerical tonsure]], but not [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]]. [[Secular clergy]] are ministers, such as deacons and priests, who do not belong to a religious institute and live in the world at large, rather than a religious institute ([[Secularity|''saeculum'']]). The [[Holy See]] supports the activity of its clergy by the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/]), a [[dicastery]] of [[Roman curia]].

[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] indicates (canon 207) that "[b]y divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, Canon 207 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction of a separate ministry was formed in the early times of Christianity; one early source reflecting this distinction, with the three ranks or orders of [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], [[presbyter|priest]] and [[deacon]], is the writings of Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]].

Holy Orders is one of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]], enumerated at the [[Council of Trent]], that the Magisterium considers to be of divine institution. In the Roman Catholic Church, only men are permitted to be clerics, although in antiquity women were ordained to the diaconate{{dubious|date=July 2018}}.

In the [[Latin Church]] before 1972, [[tonsure]] admitted someone to the clerical state, after which he could receive the four [[minor orders]] (ostiary, lectorate, order of exorcists, order of acolytes) and then the [[major orders]] of [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], diaconate, presbyterate, and finally the episcopate, which according to Roman Catholic doctrine is "the fullness of Holy Orders". Since 1972 the minor orders and the subdiaconate have been replaced by [[Catholic ministry|lay ministries]] and clerical tonsure no longer takes place, except in some [[Traditionalist Catholic]] groups, and the clerical state is acquired, even in those groups, by Holy Orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html|title=Ministeria quaedam - Disciplina circa Primam Tonsuram, Ordines Minores et Subdiaconatus in Ecclesia Latina innovatur, Litterae Apostolicae Motu Proprio datae, Die 15 m. Augusti a. 1972, Paulus PP.VI - Paulus PP. VI|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Latin Church the initial level of the three ranks of Holy Orders is that of the diaconate. In addition to these three orders of clerics, some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], or "Uniate", Churches have what are called "minor clerics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP. II - Ioannes Paulus II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] and [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are clerics only if they have received Holy Orders. Thus, unordained monks, [[friar]]s, [[nun]]s, and religious brothers and [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s are not part of the clergy.

The Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches prescribe that every cleric must be enrolled or "[[incardination and excardination|incardinated]]" in a [[diocese]] or its equivalent (an [[apostolic vicariate]], [[territorial abbey]], [[personal prelature]], etc.) or in a [[religious institute]], [[society of apostolic life]] or [[secular institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PX.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP. II - Ioannes Paulus II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for this requirement arose because of the trouble caused from the earliest years of the Church by unattached or vagrant clergy subject to no ecclesiastical authority and often causing scandal wherever they went.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law'' (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Current canon law prescribes that to be ordained a priest, an education is required of two years of [[philosophy]] and four of [[theology]], including study of dogmatic and moral theology, the Holy Scriptures, and canon law have to be studied within a [[seminary]] or an ecclesiastical faculty at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 342-356]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholicism mandates [[clerical celibacy]] for all clergy in the predominant [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]], with the exception of deacons who do not intend to become priests. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopacy]] is excluded (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy|personal ordinariate]]). [[Clerical marriage]] is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some [[particular Church]] celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy only for bishops.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], clergy in [[Western Europe]] had four privileges:{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
# '''Right of Canon''': whoever committed real violence on the person of a cleric committed a [[sacrilege]]. This decree was issued in a Lateran Council of 1097 (requested by [[Pope Urban II]]), then renewed in the [[Second Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council II]] (1139)
# '''Right of Forum''': by this right clergy could be judged by ecclesiastical [[tribunal]]s only. [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Emperor Constantine I]] granted this right for bishops, which was subsequently extended to the rest of the clergy by Imperial Decree
# '''Right of Immunity''': clergy could not be called for military service or other duties or charges incompatible with their role
# '''Right of Competence''': a certain part of the income of clergy, necessary for sustenance, could not be sequestered by any action of creditors

===Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has no dedicated clergy, and is governed instead by a system of lay priesthood leaders. Locally, unpaid and part-time [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood holders]] lead the church; the worldwide church is supervised by full-time [[General authority|general authorities]], some of whom receive modest living allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/11/questions-and-answers?lang=eng|title=Questions and Answers - ensign|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/General_Authorities "General Authorities,"] [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]], p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; No formal theological training is required for any position. All leaders in the church are called by [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] and the [[laying on of hands]] by one who holds authority. [[Jesus Christ]] stands at the head of the church and leads the church through revelation given to the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Twelve Apostles]], all of whom are recognized as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]] and have lifetime tenure. Below these men in the hierarchy are [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]], which are assigned geographically over the [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]] of the church. Locally, the church is divided into [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]]; each stake has a [[stake president|president]], who is assisted by two counselors and a [[high council (Latter Day Saints)|high council]]. The stake is made up of several individual congregations, which are called "[[ward (LDS Church)|wards]]" or "branches." Wards are led by a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] and his counselors and branches by a [[branch president|president]] and his counselors. Local leaders serve in their positions until released by their supervising authorities.&lt;ref&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://www.mormon.org/faq/no-paid-clergy "Why Don't Mormons Have Paid Clergy?"], mormon.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, all worthy males age 12 and above receive the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]]. Youth age 12 to 18 are ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] as [[deacon (Latter Day Saints)|deacons]], [[teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]], or [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]], which authorizes them to perform certain [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and sacraments. Adult males are ordained to the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]], as [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]], seventies, [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]], or [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]] in that priesthood, which is concerned with spiritual leadership of the church. Although the term "clergy" is not typically used in the LDS Church, it would most appropriately apply to local bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding an office in the priesthood does not imply authority over other church members or agency to act on behalf of the entire church.

=== Orthodoxy ===
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=organization}}
[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] clergy: [[bishop]] (right, at [[altar]]), [[priest]] (left), and two [[deacon]]s (in gold)]]
[[File:StMichaelEOTC03b.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ethiopian Orthodox]] clergy lead a procession in celebration of [[Saint Michael]] ]]

The [[Orthodox Church]] has three ranks of holy orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. These are the same offices identified in the [[New Testament]] and found in the [[Early Church]], as testified by the writings of the [[Holy Fathers]]. Each of these ranks is ordained through the [[Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament) of the [[laying on of hands]] (called ''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'') by bishops. Priests and deacons are ordained by their own [[diocesan bishop]], while bishops are [[consecration|consecrated]] through the laying on of hands of at least three other bishops.

Within each of these three ranks there are found a number of titles. Bishops may have the title of [[archbishop]], [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], and [[patriarch]], all of which are considered [[honorific]]s. Among the Orthodox, all bishops are considered equal, though an individual may have a place of higher or lower honor, and each has his place within the [[order of precedence]]. Priests (also called [[presbyter]]s) may (or may not) have the title of [[archpriest]], [[protopresbyter]] (also called "protopriest", or "protopope"), [[hieromonk]] (a [[monk]] who has been ordained to the priesthood) [[archimandrite]] (a senior hieromonk) and [[hegumen]] (abbot). Deacons may have the title of [[hierodeacon]] (a monk who has been ordained to the deaconate), [[archdeacon]] or [[protodeacon]].

The lower clergy are not ordained through ''cheirotonia'' (laying on of hands) but through a blessing known as ''cheirothesia'' (setting-aside). These clerical ranks are [[subdeacon]], [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]] and [[altar server]] (also known as [[taper-bearer]]). Some churches have a separate service for the blessing of a [[cantor (church)|cantor]].

Ordination of a bishop, priest, deacon or subdeacon must be conferred during the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist)—though in some churches it is permitted to ordain up through deacon during the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]]—and no more than a single individual can be ordained to the same rank in any one service. Numerous members of the lower clergy may be ordained at the same service, and their blessing usually takes place during the [[Little Hours]] prior to Liturgy, or may take place as a separate service. The blessing of readers and taper-bearers is usually combined into a single service. Subdeacons are ordained during the Little Hours, but the ceremonies surrounding his blessing continue through the Divine Liturgy, specifically during the [[Great Entrance]].

Bishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the archimandrites, and are required to be celibate; however, a non-monastic priest may be ordained to the episcopate if he no longer lives with his wife (following Canon XII of the [[Quinisext Council|Quinisext Council of Trullo]])&lt;ref&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-136.htm#P6201_1388746 CCEL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary usage such a non-monastic priest is usually [[tonsure]]d to the monastic state, and then elevated to archimandrite, at some point prior to his consecration to the episcopacy. Although not a formal or canonical prerequisite, at present bishops are often required to have earned a university degree, typically but not necessarily in [[theology]].

Usual titles are ''Your Holiness'' for a patriarch (with ''Your All-Holiness'' reserved for the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]), ''Your Beatitude'' for an archbishop/metropolitan overseeing an [[autocephaly|autocephalous Church]], ''Your Eminence'' for an archbishop/metropolitan generally, ''Master'' or ''Your Grace'' for a bishop and ''Father'' for priests, deacons and monks,&lt;ref&gt;Clergy Etiquette [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/clergy_etiquette.aspx Orthodoxinfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although there are variations between the various Orthodox Churches. For instance, in Churches associated with the Greek tradition, while the Ecumenical Patriarch is addressed as "Your All-Holiness," all other Patriarchs (and archbishops/metropolitans who oversee autocephalous Churches) are addressed as "Your Beatitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goarch.org/resources/etiquette|title=Forms of Addresses and Salutations for Orthodox Clergy - Parish &amp; Church Life - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=goarch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox priests, deacons, and subdeacons must be either married or celibate (preferably monastic) prior to ordination, but may not marry after ordination.  ''Re''marriage of clergy following divorce or widowhood is forbidden. Married clergy are considered as best-suited to staff parishes, as a priest with a family is thought better qualified to counsel his flock.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Parry, David Melling, Dimitri Brady, Sidney Griffith &amp; John Healey (eds.), 1999, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'', Oxford, pp116-7&lt;/ref&gt; It has been common practice in the Russian tradition for unmarried, non-monastic clergy to occupy academic posts.

=== Protestantism ===
[[File:LutheranClergy.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Lutheran pastor confirming the youth of his congregation]]
Clergy in [[Protestantism]] fill a wide variety of roles and functions. In many [[Religious denominations|denominations]], such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], the roles of clergy are similar to Roman Catholic or Anglican clergy, in that they hold an [[ordained]] pastoral or priestly office, administer the sacraments, proclaim the word, lead a local church or parish, and so forth. The [[Baptist]] tradition only recognizes two ordained positions in the church as being the elders (pastors) and deacons as outlined in the third chapter of I Timothy{{bibleref2c|1Tim|3}}  in the Bible. The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] ordains two types of [[presbyter]]s or elders, teaching (pastor) and ruling (leaders of the congregation which form a council with the pastors). Teaching elders are seminary trained and ordained as a presbyter and set aside on behalf of the whole denomination to the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Ordinarily, teaching elders are installed by a presbytery as pastor of a congregation. Ruling elders, after receiving training, may be commissioned by a presbytery to serve as a pastor of a congregation, as well as preach and administer sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ''Book of Order: 2009-2011'' (Louisville: Office of the General Assembly), Form of Government, Chapter 6 and 14. See also {{cite web |url=http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307070026/http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-07 |title=Theology and Worship }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the [[Baptist]] and other [[Congregational]] groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.

Some Protestant denominations require that candidates for ordination be "licensed" to the ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries, such as music ministry or youth ministry.

Many Protestant denominations reject the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress the ''priesthood of all believers''. Based on this theological approach, most Protestants do not have a [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders|ordination]] like the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule, as the [[Book of Concord|Lutheran Book of Concord]] allows ordination to be received as a sacrament.

Some Protestant denominations dislike the word ''clergy'' and do not use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as [[pastor]]s or [[Religious minister|minister]]s, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as he or she holds a particular office.

== Islam ==

[[Islam]], like [[Judaism]], has no clergy in the [[sacerdotal]] sense; there is no institution resembling the Christian priesthood. Islamic religious leaders  do not "serve as intermediaries between mankind and God",&lt;ref name="pipes-1983-38"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pipes |first1=Daniel |title=In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power |date=1983 |publisher=Routledge. |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK00DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=clerics+in+Islam+are+more+like+rabbi+than+priest+daniel+pipes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2-camq7vbAhVk4YMKHQU1DSUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clerics%20in%20Islam%20are%20more%20like%20rabbi%20than%20priest%20daniel%20pipes&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have "process of ordination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

The title ''[[mullah]]'' (a Persian variation of the Arabic ''maula'', "master"), commonly translated "cleric" in the West and thought to be analogous to "priest" or "rabbi", is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The title ''[[sheikh]]'' ("elder") is used similarly.

Most of the religious titles associated with Islam are scholastic or academic in nature: they recognize the holder's exemplary knowledge of the theory and practice of ''ad-d&amp;iacute;n'' (religion), and do not confer any particular spiritual or sacerdotal authority. The most general such title is ''`alim'' (pl. ''[[Ulama|`ulamah]]''), or "scholar". This word describes someone engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences ''(`ulum)'' at an Islamic university or ''[[Madrasa|madrasah jami`ah]]''. A scholar's opinions may be valuable to others because of his/her knowledge in religious matters; but such opinions should not generally be considered binding, infallible, or absolute, as the individual Muslim is directly responsible to God for his or her own religious beliefs and practice.
&lt;!--
There is no sacerdotal office corresponding to the Christian priest or Jewish ''kohen'', as there is no sacrificial rite of atonement comparable to the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Korban]]. [[Ritual slaughter]] or ''[[dhabihah]]'', including the ''qurban'' at ''[[Eid al-Adha|`Idu l-Ad'ha]],'' may be performed by any adult Muslim who is physically able and properly trained. Professional butchers may be employed, but they are not necessary; in the case of the ''qurban'', it is especially preferable to slaughter one's own animal if possible.
--&gt;

===Sunni===
[[File:Gérôme - Mufti Reading in His Prayer Stool.jpg|thumb|A [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] cleric ([[mufti]]) delivering a sermon on the [[Chair|kursi]]]]
The nearest analogue among Sunni Muslims to the parish priest or pastor, or to the "pulpit [[rabbi]]" of a synagogue, is called the ''imam khatib.'' This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader ''(imam)'' of the congregational prayer, which in most mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher ''(khatib)'' of the sermon or ''khutba'' of the obligatory congregational prayer at midday every Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques ''imam khatib'' is a permanent part-time or full-time position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority – ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.,'' the national government, or the [[waqf]] which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as an ''imam khatib'' is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam.

The title ''[[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]]'' (lit. "preserver") is awarded to one who has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the purpose; the ''imam khatib'' of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a ''hafiz.''

There are several specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or ''[[Sharia|shari`ah]].'' A scholar with a specialty in ''fiqh'' or jurisprudence is known as a ''[[faqih]]''. A ''[[qadi]]'' is a judge in an Islamic court. A ''[[mufti]]'' is a scholar who has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial opinions or ''[[fatwa|fatawah]]''.

===Shia===
[[File:Nahavandi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iranian people|Iranian]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] cleric and author Sheikh Ali Akbar Nahavandi.]]
In modern [[Shia Islam]], scholars play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam; and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as ''[[Ayatollah]]''. Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been used in [[Twelver]] Shi`ism, namely ''marjaʿ at-taqlid''. ''[[Marjaʿ]]'' (pl. ''marajiʿ'') means "source", and ''taqlid'' refers to religious emulation or imitation. Lay Shi`ah must identify a specific ''marjaʿ'' whom they emulate, according to his legal opinions ''(fatawah)'' or other writings. On several occasions, the ''Marjaʿiyyat'' (community of all ''marajiʿ'') has been limited to a single individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living in the Twelver Shi'ah world. Of broader importance has been the role of the ''mujtahid'', a cleric of superior knowledge who has the authority to perform ''[[ijtihad]]'' (independent judgment). Mujtahids are few in number, but it is from their ranks that the ''marajiʿ at-taqlid'' are drawn.

===Sufism===
[[File:Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] cleric [[Ali Khan (Sufi)|Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan]].]]
The spiritual guidance function known in many Christian denominations as "pastoral care" is fulfilled for many Muslims by a ''murshid'' ("guide"), a master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as ''tasawuf'' or [[Sufism]]. Sufi guides are commonly styled ''Shaikh'' in both speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called ''[[marabout]]s''. They are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching lineage reaching back to [[Muhammad]]. (The lineal succession of guides bears a superficial similarity to Christian ordination and apostolic succession, or to Buddhist dharma transmission; but a Sufi guide is regarded primarily as a specialized teacher and Islam denies the existence of an earthly hierarchy among believers.)

Muslims who wish to learn Sufism dedicate themselves to a ''murshid''&amp;apos;s guidance by taking an oath called a ''[[Bay'ah|bai'ah]]''. The aspirant is then known as a ''murid'' ("disciple" or "follower"). A ''murid'' who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is sometimes known as a [[dervish]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], it was common for scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the "exterior sciences" ''(`ulum az-zahir)'' of the madrasahs as well as the "interior sciences" ''(`ulum al-batin)'' of Sufism. [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi]] are two notable examples.

===Ahmadiyya===
The highest office an Ahmadi can hold is that of [[Khalifatul Masih|''Khalifatu l-Masih'']]. Such a person may appoint amirs who manage regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Resurgence in Ghana Since 1950: Nathan Samwini - 2003 p151&lt;/ref&gt; The consultative body for Ahmadiyya is called the ''Majlis-i-Shura'', which ranks second in importance to the ''Khalifatu l-Masih''.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice'', p.93, Simon Ross Valentine, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ahmadiyya community is declared as [[Persecution of Ahmadis|non-Muslims]] by many mainstream Muslims and they reject the messianic claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.

== Judaism ==
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Jewry]]
[[Rabbinic Judaism]] does not have clergy as such, although according to the [[Torah]] there is a tribe of priests known as the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] who were leaders of the religion up to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD when most [[Sadducee]]s were wiped out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the synagogue and perform the ''[[Pidyon haben]]'' (redemption of the first-born son) ceremony.

Since the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the religious leaders of Judaism have often been [[rabbi]]s, who are technically scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]]. All types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be ordained as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |title=Orthodox Women To Be Trained As Clergy, If Not Yet as Rabbis – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml |title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult male Jew (or adult Jew in non-traditional congregations) can lead prayer services. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah; the first time this word is mentioned is in the [[Mishnah]]. The modern form of the rabbi developed in the [[Talmud]]ic era. Rabbis are given authority to make interpretations of [[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]]. Traditionally, a man obtains one of three levels of [[Semicha]] (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an arduous learning program in Torah, [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud, [[Midrash]], Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].

[[File:ReginaJonas1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Regina Jonas]], the world's first female rabbi, ordained in 1935, killed in the [[Holocaust]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/jonas-regina |title=Jonas Regina}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the early medieval era an additional communal role, the ''[[Hazzan]]'' (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services, primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or "sacramental" distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to perform weddings, and certify births and deaths.

Additionally, Jewish authorities license ''[[mohel]]s'', people specially trained by experts in Jewish law and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/ |title=Making the cut &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Orthodox Judaism does not license women as mohels, but other types of Judaism do. They are appropriately called ''mohelot'' (pl. of ''mohelet,'' f. of mohel)
[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/]. As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California states, "...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but] none exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be undertaken by a Jewish man.".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

In many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual purity, cannot act as mohels, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but some mohels are also either rabbis or cantors.

Another licensed cleric in Judaism is the ''[[shochet]]'', who are trained and licensed by religious authorities for [[kosher]] slaughter according to ritual law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandin|first=Temple|year=1980|title=Problems With Kosher Slaughter|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_faafp/21/|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|volume=1 |issue=6|pages=375–390|via=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then there is the ''[[mashgiach]]''. A ''mashgiach'' is someone who supervises the ''[[kashrut]]'' status of a kosher establishment. The ''mashgiach'' must know the Torah laws of ''kashrut'', and how they apply in the environment he is supervising. Obviously, this can vary. In many instances, the ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi. This helps, since rabbinical students learn the laws of kosher as part of their syllabus. However, not every ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi, and not every rabbi is qualified to be a ''mashgiach''.

=== Orthodox Judaism ===
In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming rabbis or cantors in the Orthodox world primarily because this would affect many aspects of communal observances and practices .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Most Orthodox rabbinical seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but few require a formal degree from a civil education institutions that often define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education.

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], generally understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual leaders known as ''[[Rebbe]]s'', often translated in English as "Grand Rabbi". The office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, may also be passed from Rebbe to student, or recognized by a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an ordained rabbi to be a Rebbe, at some points in history there were female Rebbes as well, particularly the [[Maiden of Ludmir]].

=== Conservative Judaism ===
In [[Conservative Judaism]], both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous.  First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and [[rabbinic literature]], philosophy and theology, liturgy, Jewish history, and Hebrew literature of all periods.

=== Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism ===
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] do not maintain the traditional requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law, but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.

== Sikhism ==
[[Sikh]] clergy consists of five ''[[Jathedar]]s'', one each from five ''[[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]]'' or sacred seats. The ''Jathedars'' are appointed by the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs sometimes called the "Parliament of Sikhs." The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called ''[[Akal Takht]]'' and the ''Jathedar'' of ''Akal Takht'' makes all the important decisions after consultations with the ''Jathedars'' of the other four ''takhts'' and the SGPC.

==Traditional religions==
{{See also|Imperial cult}}

Historically [[Ethnic religion|traditional]] (or ''[[pagan]]'') religions typically combine religious authority and political power. What this means is that the [[sacred king|sacred king or queen]] is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high priest or priestess (see, for example, the [[Maya priesthood]]). When the functions of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, [[Apotheosis|deification]] could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s. The [[Vedic priesthood]] of India is an early instance of a structured body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon the priestly monarchs of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] holy city of [[Ile-Ife]] in [[Nigeria]], whose reigning [[List of rulers of Ife|Oni]]s have performed ritual ceremonies for centuries for the sustenance of the entire planet and its people.

== Health risks for ministry in the United States ==

In recent years, studies have suggested that American clergy in certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions are more at risk than the general population of obesity, hypertension and depression. Their life expectancies have fallen in recent years and in the last decade their use of antidepressants has risen.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Several religious bodies in the United States ([[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Baptists|Baptist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]) have implemented measures to address the issue, through [[Workplace wellness|wellness]] campaigns, for example - but also by simply ensuring that clergy take more time off. It is unclear whether similar symptoms affect American [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics, although an anecdotal comment by one American imam suggested that leaders of mosques may also share these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02burnout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clergy&amp;st=cse|title=Evidence Grows of Problem of Clergy Burnout|first=Paul|last=Vitello|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the findings of these studies is the case of American [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests, who are required by [[canon law]] to take a spiritual retreat each year, and four weeks of vacation. Sociological studies at the [[University of Chicago]] have confirmed this exception; the studies also took the results of several earlier studies into consideration and included Roman Catholic priests nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;
See A. M. Greeley, ''Priests: A Calling in Crisis'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004).
&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear whether American clergy in other religious traditions experience the same symptoms, or whether clergy outside the United States are similarly affected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10776">'''Comparative theology''' is a relatively new discipline within [[theology]], which holds together "comparative" and "theology" in creative tension.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}} It represents a particular type of theological practice committed to deep interreligious learning ("comparative") while staying rooted in a particular religious tradition ("theology"). Moreover, while many of its proponents come from the [[Christianity|Christian]] religious tradition, it can have as a starting point the theology of any religious tradition.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}}

== Relations to other disciplines ==
[[File:Francis X. Clooney.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis X. Clooney]], a leading exponent of comparative theology]]
[[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis X. Clooney]], a leading figure within comparative theology, sees comparative theology essentially as "faith seeking understanding".{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=9}} He explains the distinctiveness of comparative theology by clarifying the relationship between comparative theology and the related disciplines of [[comparative religion]], [[theology of religions]], and [[interfaith dialogue|interreligious dialogue]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=9–16}}

=== Comparative theology vs. comparative religion ===
Comparative theology shares with [[comparative religion]] an interest in the comparative study of religion. However, in contrast to comparative religion, which seeks to examine the similarities and differences between a variety of religious traditions from a neutral point of view, comparative theology focuses on the theological reflection of one's own religion in light of the insights from another religious tradition. Rather than emphasizing a religiously-detached position,{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=9}} comparative theology is deeply rooted in a particular religious tradition. Francis X. Clooney explains:{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=10}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Comparative theology – comparative and theological beginning to end – marks acts of faith seeking understanding which are rooted in a particular faith tradition but which, from that foundation, venture into learning from one or more other faith traditions. This learning is sought for the sake of fresh theological insights that are indebted to the newly encountered tradition/s as well as the home tradition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Comparative theology vs. theology of religion ===
Comparative theology shares with [[theology of religions]] a theological interest in the encounter between Christian faith and other religions; but from a different angle, and with a different emphasis and aim. Theology of religion attempts to clarify the relationship between Christian faith and other religious traditions with regard to how other religions can be understood in light of normative claims of Christian faith, in particular, related to salvation and Christ.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=15}} Theology of religion thus reflects from Christian theological claims, based on general descriptions of other religious traditions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=14}} In contrast to this, comparative theology is a theology of religious learning. It emphasizes an in-depth study of the particularities of other religious traditions instead of basing itself on general descriptions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=15}} "Comparative theology is not primarily about which religion is the true one, but about learning across religious borders in a way that discloses the truth of my faith, in the light of their faith."{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=15–16}}

=== Comparative theology vs. interreligious dialogue ===
Comparative theology shares with [[Interfaith dialogue|interreligious dialogue]] a commitment to engage in dialogue and listen carefully to the religious other. It must, however, go further than just listening: "The comparative theologian must do more than listen to others explain their faith; she must be willing to study their traditions deeply alongside her own, taking both to heart."{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=13}}

== Sources and methodology ==
The unique character of comparative theology derives from its sources and methodology.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}}

Comparative theology works with two types of religious sources. While rooted in one tradition, comparative theology has its foundation also in at least one additional religious tradition. Clooney describes comparative theology&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . as truly [[constructive theology]], distinguished by its sources and ways of proceeding, by its foundation in more than one tradition (although the comparativist always remains rooted in one tradition), and by reflection which builds on that foundation, rather than simply on themes or by methods already articulated prior to comparative practice.{{sfn|Clooney|1995|p=522}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rigveda_MS2097.jpg|thumb|''[[Rigveda]]'' manuscript in [[Devanagari]]]]
Comparative theology is dialectical practice. The comparison starts with a critical study of the other religion.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} This first step involves a persistent and disciplined in-depth study of the other religious tradition where the theologian exposes herself to the sacred texts of the other tradition. The comparative theologian practices "hermeneutical openness" in a manner where comprehension should precede judgment.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}} This implies a "[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]" of subjective commitments / theological judgments, allowing the other religious tradition to speak as much as possible on its own terms.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=44}} It is a practice of making oneself "vulnerable to intellectual, imaginative, affective transformation."{{sfn|Clooney|2008|p=208}}

The comparison, in turn, becomes a conversation with your own tradition.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} The insights emerging from the encounter with the other religious tradition might influence the conceptual framework for interpreting your own tradition, causing a reconsideration of your Christian identity. Correlations are made between the two traditions, which might imply recognition of similarities or recognition of differences.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} At this point "the 'normative theological judgments' that were temporarily suspended are brought back into the hermeneutical circle."{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=45}} Grounds are provided for raising more profound theological questions, conversation with other theologians, and potentially leading to new theological construction. This theological procedure resonates with Clooney's claim that&lt;blockquote&gt;Comparative theology is a theology deeply changed by its attention to the details of multiple religious and theological traditions, a theology that occurs only after comparison.{{sfn|Clooney|1995|p=522}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Contemporary theology has, so far, been mainly a text-based discipline, and comparative theologians engage primarily with texts from one religious tradition outside their own, due to the in-depth study that is required.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}} Although associated with Christian theology, the approach applied in comparative theology is not particularly Christian and can be a practiced grounded in other religious traditions as well.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}}

== History and key figures ==
[[File:Roberto de Nobili (1577-1656), gravure.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roberto de Nobili]] (1577–1656), [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary to [[India]]]]
Comparative theology has historical forerunners in figures such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Roberto de Nobili]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=27–29}}

Since the 1980s, comparative theology has developed as a particular theological response to the growing religious diversity in the contemporary world. It has been introduced by [[Francis X. Clooney]] and [[James L. Fredericks]], and is a methodology used by individuals such as [[David Tracy]], [[Keith Ward]], and [[Robert C. Neville]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=41–53}} The discipline arose through the growing impact of Alan Race's three-fold understanding of [[Theology of religions#Basic Three-Point Model|theology of religions]], that resulted in various arguments about the benefits of the models of theology of religions.{{sfn|Knitter|2005}}

A new generation of comparative theologians is today expanding the discourse, drawing it in new directions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010b}}

The "'''conflict thesis'''" is a [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] which maintains that there is an intrinsic intellectual conflict between [[religion]] and [[science]] and that the [[relationship between religion and science]] inevitably leads to hostility; examples to support this thesis have commonly been drawn from the relations between science and religion in Western Europe.

== The historical conflict thesis ==
[[File:John William Draper.jpg|right|thumb|John William Draper]]
[[File:Andrew Dickson White 1885.jpg|right|thumb|Andrew Dickson White]]
In the 1800s the relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional interactions were expressed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=9780674057418|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was around the mid-1800s that discussion of "science and religion" first emerged because before this time, "science" still included moral and metaphysical dimensions, was not inherently linked to the [[scientific method]], and the term "scientist" did not emerge until 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|isbn=022618448X|chapter=6. Professing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist [[John William Draper]] and the writer [[Andrew Dickson White]] were the most influential exponents of the conflict thesis between religion and science. Draper had been the speaker in the [[British Association]] [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|meeting of 1860]] which led to the famous confrontation between Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] over [[Darwinism]], and in America "the religious controversy over biological evolution reached its most critical stages in the late 1870s".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Post-Darwinian Controversies|first= James R. |last= Moore|page= 10|publisher=|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ppXB4mBY05AC}} quoting Schlesinger. But see also James C. Ungureanu, "A Yankee at Oxford: John William Draper at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford, 30 June 1860," ''Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science '' (Dec 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1870s Draper was invited by American science popularizer Edward Livingston Youmans to write a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), a book replying to contemporary issues in Roman Catholicism, such as the [[papal infallibility|doctrine of papal infallibility]], and mostly criticizing what he claimed to be [[anti-intellectualism]] in [[Roman Catholicism|the Catholic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D (2001), ''Rebuilding the Matrix'', Lion Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7459-5116-3}} (pg. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; but also making criticisms of [[Islam]] and of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;
"Averroes, in his old age - he died A. D. 1193 - was expelled from Spain; the religious party had triumphed over the philosophical. He was denounced as a traitor to religion.  An opposition to philosophy had been organized all over the Mussulman world. There was hardly a philosopher who was not punished." (p142) "The two rival divisions of the Christian Church - Protestant and Catholic - were thus in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered to be agreeable to the Scriptures." (p218)
&lt;/ref&gt; Draper's preface summarises the conflict thesis:

{{quotation|The history of Science is not a mere record of  isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, ''History of the Conflict Religion'', D. Appleton and Co. (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1874 White published his thesis in [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 8/February 1876/The Warfare of Science I|Popular Science Monthly]] and in book form as ''The Warfare of Science'':

{{quotation|In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science—and invariably. And, on the other hand, all untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to religion some of its stages may have seemed, for the time, to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and of science.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Warfare of Science|first= Andrew Dickson|last= White|year= 1876|page= 8|url= https://archive.org/details/warfareofscience00whituoft}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1896, White published ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'', the culmination of over thirty years of research and publication on the subject, criticizing what he saw as restrictive, dogmatic forms of [[Christianity]]. In the introduction, White emphasized that he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting [[Ezra Cornell]] in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation.

[[James Joseph Walsh]], M.D., the historian of medicine, criticized White's perspective as anti-historical in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22760194&amp;id=B-cQAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22popes+and+science%22 ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time''] (1908),&lt;ref&gt;Fordam University Press, 1908, Kessinger Publishing, reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-3646-9}}  Reviews: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=02tZKPD5CJrIa31EgK&amp;id=G57Y1rlQVP0C&amp;pg=PT2&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=%22the+popes+and+science%22] [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1407075]&lt;/ref&gt; a book dedicated to [[Pope Pius X]]:

Only those who know nothing  about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. White's book, contradicted as it is so directly by all serious histories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teachers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and emphasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James Joseph, ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'', Fordam University Press, New York 1908, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''God and Nature'' (1986), [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] report that "White's ''Warfare'' apparently did not sell as briskly as Draper's ''Conflict'', but in the end it proved more influential, partly, it seems, because Draper's strident anti-Catholicism soon dated his work and because White's impressive documentation gave the appearance of sound scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers, ''God &amp; Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'', University of California Press (April 29, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, historians' acceptance of the conflict thesis declined until rejected in the 1970s. David B. Wilson notes:

In his course on science and religion, historian Lawrence Principe summarizes Draper's and White's works by saying, "While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coursebook, Principe writes, "No serious historians of science or of the science-religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable."
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}


Regarding the scholarship of Draper's work, Principe says
{{quotation|How does he [John William Draper] support his contention of conflict?  Well, unfortunately, with some of the worst historical writing you are ever likely to come across.  Historical facts are confected, causes and chronologies twisted to the author’s purpose.  We find interpretations made merely by declaration.  We find quotations violently taken out of context.  And instances, quite a few of them where Draper claims a historical writer said something in fact 180 degrees away from what he actually claimed...Much of Draper’s book is so ridiculous, so malodramatic, so rabid, it’s hard for a knowledgeable person actually to read it without a wry smirk...Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Principe's summary comment on Draper's work at the end of his coursebook reads: "The book that started the conflict myth.  Take a sense of humor and/or a stiff drink with this dated bit of melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Academic===

Historians of science today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (those involving Galileo and Darwin) in favor of a "complexity" model, because religious figures took positions on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved in discrediting religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Richard H.|title= For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science|year= 2011|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 9780761855668|pages= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said: "White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science. And both develop and use the same myths to support their narrative, the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|flat-earth legend]] prominently among them".&lt;ref name=Gould1996&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of the [[historiography]] of the conflict thesis, [[Colin A. Russell]], the former President of [[Christians in Science]], said that "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Colin A., "The Conflict of Science and Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion'', p. 15, New York 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Religion'', Gary Ferngren proposes a complex relationship between religion and science:

{{quotation|While some historians had always regarded the Draper-White thesis as oversimplifying and distorting a complex relationship, in the late twentieth century it underwent a more systematic reevaluation.  The result is the growing recognition among historians of science that the relationship of religion and science has been much more positive than is sometimes thought.  Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization.  If [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] and the [[Scopes trial]] come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor).

Some modern historians of science (such as Peter Barker, [[Bernard R. Goldstein]], and Crosbie Smith) propose that scientific discoveries - such as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] in the 17th century, and the reformulation of physics in terms of [[energy]], in the 19th century - were driven by religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Peter, and Goldstein, Bernard R.

London: The Athlone PRess, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious organizations and clerics figure prominently in the broad histories of science, until the [[profession]]alization of the scientific enterprise, in the 19th century, led to tensions between scholars taking religious and secular approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the chapters on "Geology and Paleontology" (by Nicolaas A. Rupke), "Natural History" (by Peter M. Hess), and "Charles Darwin" (by James Moore) in Gary Ferngren (ed.), ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the prominent examples of religion's apparent conflict with science, the [[Galileo affair]] (1614) and the [[Scopes trial]] (1925), were not pure instances of conflict between science and religion, but included personal and political facts in the development of each conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Richard J., "Galileo Galilei", ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''; Larson, Edward J.

{{main|Galileo affair}}
The Galileo affair is one of the few examples commonly used by advocates of the conflict thesis. Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of "the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion," and that this view promotes "the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion." Finocchiaro writes, "I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic," and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo "saw" the earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was "imprisoned," since he was "actually held under house arrest."&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included scientific, philosophical, and theological arguments.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt;

The Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed Heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named ''Simplicio'' who was a simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in [[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|''The Sleepwalkers'']] [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This angered the Pope and weakened Galileo's position politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Lindberg|first = David|title = Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]]. Galileo's ''Dialogue'' was banned, the publication of his past or future works forbidden, he was ordered to "abjure, curse and detest" heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–293).&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230419/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 |date=September 27, 2007 }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234122/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 |date=September 27, 2007 }}{{it icon}}.

===Scientist and public perceptions===

This thesis is still held to be true in whole or in part by some prominent contemporary scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]] who has said "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HEUSSNER|first1=KI MAE|title=Stephen Hawking on Religion: 'Science Will Win'|website=ABC News|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Steven Weinberg]], grant that it is possible for science and religion to be compatible since some prominent scientists are also religious, but he sees some significant tensions that potentially weaken religious beliefs overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Lake Views: This World and the Universe|date=2011|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674062302|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done on scientists from 21 American universities showed that most did not perceive conflict between science and religion. In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm. Additionally, scientists were more likely to reject conflict thesis if their peers held positive views of religion.&lt;ref name="scientists religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|author2=Park, Jerry Z. |title=Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?|year=2009|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=276–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01447.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Ronald Numbers]] suggests the conflict theory lingers in a popular belief, inclusive of scientists and clerics alike, and that while history reflects an intrinsic and inevitable intellectual conflict between (Judeo-Christian) religion and science, it is perpetuated by the [[polemic]]s surrounding controversies involving [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]], and [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion|title=Statements from Religious Organizations|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging, for example, "school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

Research on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science, and that they have no differences with nonreligious groups in propensity to seek out scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–727|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–353|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Center]] made similar findings and also noted that the majority of Americans (80–90%) strongly support scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter |author2=Gregory Smith |author3=David Masci |pages=1–2, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to express very favorable views towards science.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415873697|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |page=336,345–346|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists.

'''Deconsecration''' is the act of removing a religious blessing from something that had been previously [[consecration|consecrated]] by a minister or priest of that religion. The practice is usually performed on churches to be rendered to non-religious ([[secular]]) use or demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/03/archives/deconsecration-of-a-london-church.html |title=Deconsecration of a London Church |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1876 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi.

The '''Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church''' is an offshoot of the [[Rastafari]] movement that flourished in the 1970s in Jamaica and was incorporated in [[Florida]] in 1975. Members of the movement say it is based on the teachings of [[Marcus Garvey]] and that they use  [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as the Rastafari [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/potbible.htm Marijuana and the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the group was accused, tried, and convicted of smuggling massive amounts of potent cannabis from [[Jamaica]] to [[Miami]] in actions that kept the Jamaican economy afloat that decade. The then-Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] told a U.S. interview "It's just a little ''[[:wikt:sinsemilla|sinsemilla]]'' that it keep the country going right now". The Coptics published a free newspaper promoting Garveyism and the decriminalization of marijuana. They were also featured on a sensational episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on October 28, 1979. The group's leader was Thomas Reilly, also known as [[Brother Louv]]. During the same year, The Supreme Court of Florida found: "(1) the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church represents a religion within the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and (2) the “use of cannabis is an essential portion of the religious practice."&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; "Further, the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is not a new church or religion but the record reflects it is centuries old and has regularly used cannabis as its sacrament”.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/Legal/Town_1979|title=Town v. State, 377 So.2d 648 (Fla. 1979)|date=November 1, 1979|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the organization participated in the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s hearings on [[cannabis rescheduling in the United States]].

On August 8, 1994 [[Jim Tranmer]], a former member of the group, wrote a letter to Carl Olsen while meditating on his 35-year prison sentence and his departure from the EZCC's "malicious hierarchy".  Olsen ran for governor in Iowa, as a Libertarian, in 1994 and for the U.S. House of Representatives, again as a Libertarian, in 1996.  He is currently a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and resides in Iowa.

The EZCC is not associated with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] or the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], both based in [[Egypt]]. The Coptic Orthodox Church has an Ethiopian sister church, which is also unrelated.

The Zion Coptic Church was featured in the 2011 [[Billy Corben]] documentary ''[[Square Grouper: The Godfathers of Ganja]]'', whose first section concerns the group and features interviews with former members.

'''Freethought''' (or "free thought")&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that positions regarding [[truth]] should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]]. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=Free thought – Define Free thought at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs.

==Definition==
Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].

Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[The nature of God in Western theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Symbol==
[[Image:Pansy aka.jpg|thumb|The [[pansy]], symbol of freethought]]

The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Monk, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=0-472-06938-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=1-57181-299-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3485-8 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{Main|Organized secularism}}
The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches.

====Canada====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England.

In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada. HAC, also known as Humanist Canada, operates as an active voice for humanism in Canada{{cn|date=May 2018}} and supports the activities of groups who wish to raise awareness about secular issues.

The [http://www.secularalliance.ca Canadian Secular Alliance] is an active community.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–32 |id= |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">'''Gerin oil''' or '''geriniol''' is a fictional drug used as a device to criticize [[religion]] in articles written by [[Richard Dawkins]]. The word is an [[anagram]] of "[[religion]]".

The first article, ''Gerin Oil'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html Gerin Oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725123716/http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in an American [[secular humanism]] publication, ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', in December 2003 (Volume 24, No. 1).  It was popularised in an article titled ''Opiate of the Masses''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7036 Opiate of the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes a dangerous legal drug "Gerin Oil" or "Geriniol." Dawkins blames its effects as being responsible for historic acts of violence such as the [[September 11th attacks]], massacres of native South Americans by [[conquistadors]], and the [[Salem Witch Trials]].

In Dawkins' satirical description, users are often introduced to the "drug" at social gatherings such as weddings and funerals. In small amounts it is considered harmless, but its usage may increase over time. Medium usage of "Gerin Oil" is said to cause a disconnect with reality where users expect private wishes expressed to come true, and may be accompanied by spasmodic muscular movement or contraction. In large doses it is said to cause aural or visual hallucinations. He also links its use to child mutilation, sexual prohibition, and the tendency to smile when convicted of mass murder.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] included Dawkins' essay in his compilation ''[[The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Non-Believer|The Portable Atheist]]''.

'''''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World''''' is a 2009 book by [[John Micklethwait]] and [[Adrian Wooldridge]] which argues against the [[secularization]] thesis and claims that there is a global revival of faith has started in the late twentieth century.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge provided a quick coverage of American history, in which they argue that American religion was dramatically transformed by the [[disestablishment]] of churches after the [[American Revolution]].  An emerging "[[marketplace of ideas|free market]]" of religious choices led Americans to become increasingly pluralistic and tolerant of other forms of Christianity.  The voluntary nature of religious association led Americans to take ownership of their own institutions and churches, helping create a democratic sense of responsibility for creating associations and community.  These features of American culture, along with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] separation of church and state, ensured that American religions could only survive by appealing to the common people.  This democratized American Christianity, leading average Americans to shape religious movements themselves.  In the post-Revolutionary period, all this led America in an increasingly pluralist and democratic direction.&lt;ref name=gib&gt;John Micklethwait and Arian Wooldridge, ''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith is Changing the World'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2009), 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features.  World religions—and Christianity, in particular—are growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest.  Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that [[Islam]] too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.&lt;ref name=gib/&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "A meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation about the place of faith in modern life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-micklethwait/god-is-back/ |title=''God is Back'' by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge |date=March 15, 2009 |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}
'''Heterodoxy''' in a religious sense means "any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] position".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=heterodoxy Definition of orthodoxy from]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, heterodoxy is similar to unorthodoxy, while the adjective "heterodox" could be applied to a [[dissident]].

Heterodoxy is also an ecclesiastical [[Technical terminology|term of art]], defined in various ways by different religions and churches. For example, in the [[apostolic succession|Apostolic Churches]]  (the [[Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of the East]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Churches]]), heterodoxy may describe beliefs that differ from strictly orthodox views, but that fall short either of formal or of material [[heresy]].

==Ecclesiastic usage==

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the [[Orthodox Church]], the term is used primarily in reference to Christian churches and [[Christian denomination|denominations]] not belonging to the Communion of Eastern Orthodox Churches and espousing doctrines contrary to the received [[Holy Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, by Fr. Michael Pomazansky, trans. by Fr. Seraphim Rose (Platina, CA: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 1994), pp. 243-246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it describes any theological position, moral principle, spiritual practice, or lifestyle thought to be inconsistent with the catholic [[Rule of Faith]]. In general, this term is used in two distinct senses:
# to label a theological system or viewpoint which, although erroneous and unacceptable to hold or promote within Orthodoxy, has not been formally defined as heresy.
# to label a theological system or viewpoint which is both contrary to Orthodoxy and whose adherents have not been baptized into the Church, so that the attribution of heresy would be improper.

===Roman Catholicism===
Heterodoxy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] refers to views that differ from strictly orthodox views, but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid [[heresy]]. Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views, either on doctrinal or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Hornsby-Smith, Raymond M. Lee and Peter A. Reilly (1985). "Common Religion and Customary Religion: A Critique and a Proposal". ''Review of Religious Research 26(3)'', 244-252.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain, and "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261). A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are allotted to [[Limbo]] and then offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment. The belief is not orthodox, as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants; however, it is also not heresy, as the Church accepts that such a scenario ''might'' be possible.

===Protestantism===
Many [[Protestants]], such as [[Lutherans]], use the term ''heterodox'' to describe Christian teachings which are not in agreement with their understanding of scripture.  As [[Charles Spurgeon]] said:

:''...you shall find spiritual life in every church. I know it is the notion of the bigot, that all the truly godly people belong to the denomination which he adorns. Orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is anybody else’s doxy who does not agree with me.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Spurgeon, The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit Sermons, vol. 17 (London: Passmore &amp; Alabaster, 1871), 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''[[ghulat]]'' is used by Shia Muslims for beliefs perceived as being extremely heterodox (more in line with the Christian use of the word "heresy"). In particular, the term is used to describe the beliefs of minority Muslim groups who ascribe divine characteristics to a member of [[Muhammad]]'s family (especially [[Ali]]) or the early [[Sahabah|companions of the Prophet]] such as [[Salman the Persian]].  The assumption is that the groups thus described have gone too far and have come to associate them with God (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam]] Muslims see each other as heterodox, differing in practice mainly on matters of jurisprudence or ''[[fiqh]]'', splitting historically on the matter of the succession of [[Ali]] to the caliphate by [[Muawiyah]]. A third and much smaller movement is [[Ibadi]], which differ from both of these groups on a few key points. Several ultra-orthodox groups such as the [[Wahhabis]], in turn, see themselves as the only truly orthodox groups within Islam.

The Shia [[Ismailis]], who in turn split from the Shia mainstream of [[Twelvers]] over another succession dispute, have subsumed several groups which the majority of Muslims view as heterodox, such as the [[Seveners]], and [[gnostic]]-influenced [[Alawites]], and many other [[religious sect|sects]] and subsects. The gnostic-influenced [[Druze]] sect has also been affiliated with the Ismailis, but some of its followers go so far as to see it as a [[religious denomination|distinct religion]] altogether. The [[Sufis]], divided into many [[List of Sufi orders|sects and orders]], incorporate many [[mysticism|mystical]] [[doctrine]]s and [[religious ritual|rituals]] into Islam, but many also consider themselves Shi'i or Sunnis. Another Shia group, influenced heavily by the Sufis, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] religion and other mystical movements, is that of the [[Alevi]]. Historical groups viewed as highly heterodox by most Muslims include the [[Kharijites]], who took a third view on Ali's succession (and are today succeeded by the [[Ibadi]]), the [[Mu'tazili]]tes, who most famously asserted that the [[Qur'an]] was created, a view which enjoyed [[Caliph]]al approval before the time of [[Mutawakkil]], the [[Qarmatians]], a branch of the [[Seveners]] within Ismaili Islam who took control of much of the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the 9th and 10th century, practiced [[vegetarianism]], attacked [[Hajj]] pilgrims and took control of the [[Well of Zamzam]] and the [[Black Stone]] before their decline, and the [[Hashashin]] or [[Assassin]]s, another Ismaili group, famous for their reclusive lifestyle, manners of indoctrination and assassinations in the years after the [[First Crusade]].

According to [[Philip Hitti]],&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Arabs", Philip Khuri Hitti, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[caliphate]]s there was a marked tendency among several quite unrelated heterodox groups to affiliate themselves with the Shiites, particularly the Ismailis, in a general feeling of heterodox solidarity in a Sunni-controlled empire. The cause of the [[Alids]] thus became a rallying point for a diverse range of heterodox Islamic movements. The view that [[Ali]] was divine, though never mainstream within Shiism, is attested in the early centuries of Islam.

Two more recent movements seen as particularly at odds with the majority Muslim view are the [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Nation of Islam]] movements. Many followers of the former consider its 19th-century founder, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], to have been a [[prophet]], as well as such other religious figures as [[Krishna]] and [[Buddha]], despite the mainstream Muslim view that [[Muhammad]] [[Seal of the Prophets|was the last]]. Both Ahmadi denominations consider Ahmad to have been the [[Mahdi]] and [[second coming of Jesus]]. The Nation of Islam is a movement which acknowledges its 20th-century founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], as an incarnation of [[Allah]], a view most Muslims consider [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism). [[Bábism]] (most followers of which came to follow [[Baha'u'llah]] and became the [[Baha'i]]s) is viewed by many non-followers as originally having been a highly divergent movement within the Twelver Ismailism practiced in 19th-century Persia. Beyond heterodoxy, many elements of Islam have been incorporated into distinct belief systems several times, most specifically into [[Sikhism]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]], whose predecessor movement was [[Bábism]]. As a more unusual example, several [[Thuggee]] were self-reportedly Muslims, and according to [[William Sleeman]] equated the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] with [[Fatima bint Muhammad|Fatima]], a daughter of Muhammad.

==Political usage against religion==

===China===
In late 1999 legislation was created in China to outlaw "heterodox religions".&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied retroactively to [[Falun Gong]], a spiritual practice introduced to the public in China by Li Hongzhi (李洪志) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php Statement of Professor David Ownby] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326193222/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php |date=2008-03-26 }}, Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-ecclesiastic usage==

===Economics===
[[Heterodox economics]] refers to [[schools of economic thought]] that are considered outside of [[mainstream economics]], referred to as orthodox economics, often represented by expositors as contrasting with or going beyond [[neoclassical economics]]. It means considering a variety of economic schools and [[Economic methodology|methodologies]], which can include neoclassical or other orthodox economics as a part. Heterodox economics refers to a variety of separate unorthodox approaches or schools such as [[institutional economics|institutional]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]], [[Socialist economics|socialist]], [[Marxian economics|Marxian]], [[Feminist economics|feminist]], [[Georgism|Georgist]], [[Austrian School|Austrian]], [[Ecological economics|ecological]], and [[social economics]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[[JEL classification codes#History of economic thought, methodology, and heterodox approaches JEL: B Subcategories]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Frederic S., 2008. "heterodox economics," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'',  2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_H000175&amp;q=heterodox%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Search of Noah's Ark''''' is a 1976 [[documentary film]] released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] that explores the alleged final resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].

==Production notes==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' was produced by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], a [[Utah]]-based [[independent film]] company that specialized in releasing [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] family films and documentaries. Along with such features as ''[[Beyond and Back]]'' (1978) and ''[[In Search of Historic Jesus]]'' (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1978/Beyond+and+Back ''Beyond and Back'', AMC Movie Guide.] [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was based on the book by David Balsiger. Filmed independently and inexpensively, the documentary makes the assertion that Noah's Ark, from the [[Genesis flood narrative|biblical flood narrative]], has been found on [[Mountains of Ararat|the slopes]] of [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]], though physical and political difficulties prevent a more extensive study of the alleged vessel. The movie included a dramatic re-enactment of Noah's story as one of its highlights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/in-search-of-noahs-ark/ ''In Search of Noah's Ark'' at Christian Film Database.] [[Christian Film Database|CFDb]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' grossed $55.7 million at the North American box office&lt;ref name="box office"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1977/0ISNA.php|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|title=''In Search of Noah's Ark'', Box Office Information|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the [[1976 in film|sixth highest grossing film of 1976 in the United States]].

      <comment>Cleaned up the definition of 'fallibilism,' removed an unhelpful counterexample in the off-set quotation (which provided a case which of false belief rather than a plausible example of a true and fallible belief which is knowledge), and added some citations to recent literature.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">'''Infallibilism''', in [[epistemology]], is the idea that propositional [[knowledge]] is incompatible with a chance of being wrong, where this is typically understood as one's evidence or justification providing one's [[belief]] with such strong grounds that it must be [[truth|true]] and perhaps cannot be rationally doubted. Other beliefs may be rationally [[Theory of justification|justified]], but they do not rise to the level of ''knowledge'' unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, [[fallibilism]], is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. 

Fallibilism is not to be confused with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. [[René Descartes]], an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meditations on First Philosophy|last = Descartes|first = Rene|publisher = |year = 1641|isbn = 978-0-415-07707-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as "if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Descartes/DescartesInfallibilismCartesiancircle.pdf|title = Infallibilism and the Cartesian circle|last = Lacewing|first = Michael|date = 2013|journal = A Level Philosophy|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/dbt560/Fallibilism.pdf|title = How to Think about Fallibilism|date = 7 June 2001|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = University of Washington Course Server|publisher = |last = Reed|first = Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Mark Kaplan, "If you know you can't be wrong," in {{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Stephen |title=Epistemology Futures |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=180-198 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KAPIYK}}; see also {{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-010-9815-2|title = Warrant does entail truth|last = Moon|first = Andrew|date = 2012|journal = Synthese|doi = 10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015|volume=184|pages=287–297}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to Be an Infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, Hope, and Fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], under which the [[Pope]] is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches "infallibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F96-1.html|title = The History and Future of Papal Infallibility|last = Burke|first = Ronald|date = Fall 1996|work = |access-date = Oct 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of [[bishop]]s as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.com/tracts/papal-infallibility|title = Papal Infallibility|date = August 10, 2004|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Catholic Answers|publisher = |last = Brom|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology''''', published in 1877, is a book of [[esoteric]] [[philosophy]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]'s first major work and a key text in her [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical movement]]. 

The work has often been criticized as a plagiarized occult work, with scholars noting how Blavatsky extensively copied from a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. Hart|Hart, James D]]; Leininger, Phillip. (1995). ''The Oxford Companion to American Literature''. Oxford University Press. pp. 71-72. {{ISBN|0-19-506548-4}} "After a period of spiritualism in America, Mme Blavatsky with the aid of Colonel Henry S. Olcott founded her Theosophical Society and published ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877), a plagiarized occult work denouncing the spiritualism she had formerly advocated."&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Isis Unveiled'' is nevertheless also understood by modern scholars to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. (1994). ''The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge''. State University of New York Press. pp. xv-x-x, 241-245. "The Western Esoteric Tradition has no more important figures in modern times than Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;Godwin, Joscelyn. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevir"&gt;Bevir, Mark. ''The West Turns Eastward: Madame Blavatsky and the Transformation of the Occult Tradition''. Journal of the American Academy of Religion. 62.3 (1994), pp. 747-767.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna'', in ''Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism''. ed. by Wouter J. Hanegraff (Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The work was originally entitled ''The Veil of Isis'', a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 [[Rosicrucian]] work by W.W. Reade. ''Isis Unveiled'' is divided into two volumes. Volume I, ''The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science'', discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, [[elementals]], [[psychic phenomena]], and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, ''Theology'', discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to [[Eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], the [[Vedas]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. It follows the [[Renaissance]] notion of ''[[prisca theologia]]'', in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient "Wisdom-Religion".&lt;ref name="Santucci"/&gt; Blavatsky writes in the preface that ''Isis Unveiled'' is "a plea for the recognition of the [[Hermetic philosophy]], the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena P., ''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology'' (Pasadena, CA: Theosophical University Press, 1999), vol. I. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Isis Unveiled'' is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction'' (Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition—[[perennial philosophy]], a [[Neo-Platonic]] [[Emanationism|emanationist cosmology]], [[adepts]], [[esoteric Christianity]]—and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, ''Isis Unveiled'' reflected many contemporary controversies—such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories on [[evolution]] and their impact on religion—and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Bruce F. ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 34-38, 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.

In later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in ''Isis Unveiled'' appeared in a significantly altered form,{{refn|group=note|name="conceptual shift in move to india"|This shift in thought is marked by Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society's move eastward to India.&lt;ref name="WEMS"&gt;''Helena Blavatsky: Western Esoteric Masters Series'', ed. by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2004), pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}} drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction.  Specifically, the few and—according to many—ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of ''Isis Unveiled'' stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888).  Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in ''Isis Unveiled'', attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in ''Isis Unveiled'' compared to those of later works.{{refn|group=note|name="HPBs elaboration on reincarnation in IU"|In the article ''Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits'' Blavatsky elaborately addressed the confusion related to the statements on reincarnation of ''Isis Unveiled'', stating in particular that: "[… T]he doctrine [of reincarnation] is maintained now as it was then.  Moreover, there is no 'discrepancy' but only incompleteness — hence, misconceptions arising from later teachings.".&lt;ref name=trs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits|journal=Articles from The Path — April 1886 to March 1896 |date=November 1886|volume= I|issue= 8|page=232|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/path/v01n08p232_theories-about-reincarnation-and-spirits.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|name="HPB on three- and sevenfold conception of man"|In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' Blavatsky explains that the sevenfold conception of man is the threefold conception of man, refined.  In section 6, ''Theosophical Teachings as to Nature and Man'', under the heading ''The Septenary Nature of Man'' it is asked: "Is it what we call Spirit and Soul, and the man of flesh?", to which is replied: "It is not. That is the old Platonic division. Plato was an Initiate, and therefore could not go into forbidden details; but he who is acquainted with the archaic doctrine finds the seven in Plato's various combinations of Soul and Spirit.".&lt;ref name=keytotheosophy&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=The Key to Theosophy|orig-year=1889|publisher= Theosophical University Press: Online Literature|isbn=1-55700-046-8|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern Theosophists hold the book as a [[Revelation|revealed]] [[Religious text|work]] dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's [[Ascended master|Masters]].&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ‘The Coming of the Masters: The Evolutionary Reformulation of Spiritual Intermediaries in Modern Theosophy’, in ''Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western Esotericism'', ed. Andreas B. Kilcher (Leiden &amp; Boston, MA: Brill, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Emmette Coleman.png|thumb|[[William Emmette Coleman]]]]
Detractors often accuse the book of extensive unattributed [[plagiarism]], a view first seriously put forth by [[William Emmette Coleman]] shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as [[Mark Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Sedgwick|Sedgwick, Mark]]. (2004). ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|0-19-515297-2}} "''Isis Unveiled'' was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's ''Sod, the Son of Man'', 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's ''History of Magic'', and so on)."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Geoffrey Ashe]] notes that ''Isis Unveiled'' combines "comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a mélange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]]. (2001). ''Encyclopedia of Prophecy''. ABC-CLIO. p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Isis Unveiled'' makes use of a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: "Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas."&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Modern copies of ''Isis Unveiled'' are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.

Historian [[Ronald H. Fritze]] considers ''Isis Unveiled'' to be a work of [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009). ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions''. Reaktion Books. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Henry R. Evans]], a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a "hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry R. Evans|Evans, Henry R]]. (1897). ''Hours with the Ghosts, or, Nineteenth Century Witchcraft: Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Theosophy''. Laird &amp; Lee. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing ''Isis Unveiled'' and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time.&lt;ref name="Olcott"&gt;Olcott, Henry. ''Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, I'' (Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1972), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci 2"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''The Notion of Race in Theosophy'', in ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 11.3 (2008), pp. 37-63&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and [[Occultism]] as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding [[Spiritualism]] movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later [[Ascended master|Masters]], rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals—who helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her—under a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"/&gt;

[[Sten Bodvar Liljegren]] notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing [[orientalism]] of the period, the novels of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, A. L. (1958). ''Through a Glass Darkly: Spiritualism in the Browning Circle by Katherine H. Porter; Bulwer-Lytton's Novels and "Isis Unveiled" by S. B. Liljegren''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">An '''Iyi-uwa''' is an object from [[Odinani|Igbo mythology]] that binds the spirit of a dead child (known as [[ogbanje]]) to the world, causing it to return and be born again to the same mother.

Many objects can serve the purpose of iyi-uwa, including stones, dolls, hair or pieces of the dead child's clothes, [[omen]]s, or [[Votive offering|offerings]]. The iyi-uwa must be found and destroyed in order for the ogbanje to rest and stop haunting the mother. To find the object, [[shamans]] known as 'dibia' question the spirit and perform rituals to force it to reveal where the iyi-uwa is located.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/things_fall_apart/32.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by Nigerian author [[Chinua Achebe]] contains a detailed subplot involving an ogbanje child and her iyi-uwa.&lt;ref&gt;''Things Fall Apart'' by Chinua Achebe&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">'''''Karakia''''' are [[Māori people|Māori]] [[incantations]] and [[prayer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/features/powhiri/the-ceremony/karakia-prayers.cfm Newzealand.com]
&lt;/ref&gt; used to invoke spiritual guidance and protection.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Karakia'' are generally used to increase the spiritual goodwill of a gathering, so as to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a [[ceremony]]. According to legend, there was a curse on the [[Waiapu River]] which was lifted when [[George Gage (Ringatū minister)|George Gage]] (Hori Keeti) performed ''karakia''. In the [[Māori religion]], ''karakia'' are used to [[ritual|ritually cleanse]] the homes of the deceased after a burial. 

The missionary [[Richard Taylor (missionary) | Richard Taylor]] gives a 19th-century view of the traditional role and scope of ''karakia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the nineteenth-century introduction of Christianity to New Zealand, Māori adopted (or wrote new)  karakia to acknowledge the new faith. Modern karakia tend to contain a blend of Christian and traditional influence, and their poetic language may make literal translations into English not always possible.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Māori society, performances of ''karakia'' frequently open important meetings and ceremonies, both within a Māori context (such as tribal [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]], [[tangihanga|tangi]], or the inauguration of new [[marae]]), and in a wider New Zealand setting in which both Māori and [[Pākehā]] participate (such as the beginning of public meetings or at the departure of official delegations for overseas).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mapuche Machis.jpg|thumb|300px|Mapuche machis in 1903]] 
A '''machi''' is a [[traditional healer]] and religious leader in the [[Mapuche]] culture of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Machis play significant roles in [[Mapuche religion]]. In contemporary Mapuche culture women are more commonly machis than men.

==Description==
[[File:Machitún Mapuche.jpg|thumb|300px|Illustration of a machi healing a patient, from ''Atlas of Physical and Political History of Chile'' (''Atlas de la historia física y política de Chile''), by [[Claudio Gay]]]] 
As a religious authority, a machi leads healing ceremonies, called [[Machitun]]. During the machitun, the machi communicates with the spirit world. Machies also serve as advisors, and [[oracle]]s for their community. In the past, they advised on peace and warfare.

The term is sometimes interchangeable with the word ''[[kalku]]'', however, ''kalku'' has a usually evil connotation whereas ''machi'' is usually considered good;  this, however, is not always true since in common use the terms may be interchanged.

The Mapuches live in southern [[South America]] mostly in central [[Chile]] ([[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]] and [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]]) and the adjacent areas of [[Argentina]].

To become a machi, a Mapuche person has to demonstrate character, willpower, and courage, because initiation is long and painful. Usually a person is selected in infancy, based upon the following:
* premonitory dreams
* supernatural revelations
* influence of the family
* inheritance
* her or his power of healing disease
* own initiative

Machiluwun is the ceremony to consecrate a new machi. The chosen child will live six months with a dedicated machi, where he or she learns the skills to serve as a machi.

==Role in Mapuche medicine==
The machi is a person of great wisdom and healing power and is the main character of Mapuche medicine. The machi has detailed knowledge of medicinal herbs and other remedies, and is also said to have the power of the spirits and the ability to interpret dreams, called ''pewma'' (IPA pronunciation: {{IPA|pewma}}) in [[Mapudungun]]. Machis are also said to help communities identify witches or other individuals who are using supernatural powers to do harm.

Mapuche traditional medicine is gaining more acceptance in the broader Chilean society.

==Gender==
Becoming a Machi is a spiritual transformation that also fosters a place where people can flow between spectrums of gender. Within Machi rituals and ceremonies, gender is fluid and dynamic. The majority of Machi are female, but males can also be Machis. The Machi power is usually passed down from the maternal grandmother. Gender is not determined by sex, as it typically is in Chilean society, but rather by identity and spirituality and is ambiguous among Machi. Some scholars have coined this as "cogender", which is a partly feminine and partly masculine identity. Most of this research has focused on males and femininity versus females and masculinity, but all forms of gender fluidity are present within Machi culture. During some ceremonies gender is transcended and transformed spiritually, where binaries between genders do not exist and new gender identities are explored.

Within Machi culture, plants and spirits are given gender. Usually these assigned genders are based upon perceptions of masculinity and femininity. E.g. Laurel is a feminine plant because it is regarded as soothing and soft, whereas Triwe is masculine because it has protective powers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genders are fixed and do not change. Machi, however, transcend static gender and dynamically flow between them. For example, during healing ceremonies Machis can flow between male, female, and cogendered identities in order to balance the spirit of the person they are healing. As ''Shamans of the Foye Tree'' says, “gender of spirits remain permanent, whereas Machi move between gender identities”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in Machi cosmology, the Nguchen, or the giver of life, is balanced by 4 identities; the man, the woman, the young man and the young woman. Therefore, during ceremonies Machis embody some or all of these identities at different times or simultaneously in order to heal. When someone is sick, Machis believe it is because the 4 are out of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The magic mountain and other origin myths of the mapuche indians of central chile.|last=Faron|first=Louis|publisher=The Journal of American Folklore|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus within Mapuche culture, there are “well defined notions of gender, but Machis are able to manipulate them”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, gender exists in two realities, the earthly where gender is fixed and spiritual where gender in fluid. Machis are able to flow between both realities freely.

=== Gender Roles and Discrimination ===
While the Machis accept many different and even conflicting identities, Chilean society does not. Transgender Machi women who do not fit into traditional gender roles face a lot of discrimination and [[transphobia]]. Homophobia and transphobia are rampant in Chilean and Mapuche culture. The Machis are respected, but also shunned. Machi women are not viewed fully as women by Mapuche society because of their “masculine power” and Machi men are not viewed fully as male because of their femininity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male machis, also called the Machi Weye, face discrimination from other Mapuches. Males are perceived as weak for taking upon a feminized role but are simultaneously regarded as more powerful than female machis. Yet other people view them as “not possessing as many powers as the [female] machis” because “females are more connected to nature”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigulapo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people view male machis as more powerful and adept than female machis due to traditional gender stereotypes of women inherently being weaker.  One Mapuche person states that while he discriminates against Machi men that  “when [he] is sick, when [he] needs a ngillatun, [he] goes begging to the male machi”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of the gendered perception of Machis i.e. that they are usually female, many male machi face discrimination from fellow Mapuche and Chilean society as a whole. Since they do not fit conventional gender stereotypes, these feminine male Machis are out-casted and called derogatory names. One Mapuche states “they [male machi] may be stronger, but they wear women’s clothes...He must like pigs legs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many male Machi dress in women’s clothing as this is perceived to be more pious and connected to nature. Machismo in Chilean society plays a large role in such discrimination as men are out-casted from circles because they are seen as “too feminine”. In this way patriarchal culture simultaneously outcasts male Machi but also reinforces stereotypes that males are more powerful than females. As a result many male Machi have reinvented themselves as “celibate priests” or “spiritual warriors” in order to avoid further criticism and protect their masculinity. In some healing ceremonies and rituals male Machis are not permitted to participate because “they are not close enough to nature” and “[women] are more patient with the sick and know more about herbs…the spirits get along with women better”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, patriarchal culture works in multiple ways. It leads to discrimination and misogyny against male and female machi and also creates complicated power dynamics where in some circles women are perceived as inferior and in other circles perceived as more powerful.

Machi women are sometimes out-casted from traditional Mapuche gender roles. Machi women are revered and feared. Masculine female machi are called derogatory terms such as ''bruja'' (witch) ''mujer de la calle'' (woman of the street) or ''marica'' (derogatory term of homosexual). One Machi describes that Machi women are given a higher status than Mapuche women because “they are sent here [earth] by god” and are therefore divine. She says for example “she is served before other people [at meals]”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this way the Machi regulate their own gender norms but are also combatted with traditional gender norms of Mapuche and Chilean society. This further complicates the notion of gender within the society.

Gender in Machi culture is filled with contradictions, paradoxes, and complications because they simultaneously exist within the gender binary and defy it.  “Whereas male Machi legitimate their sexuality as celibate priests, most female Machi gain status and virtue by marrying and having children”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Machi still abide by the gender roles and norms of Mapuche culture, but then fight against them during spiritual ceremonies and rituals where they challenge traditional roles and perceptions of gender and embrace cogendered identities.  
The gender identity and construction of the Machi is nuanced and complex. Machi are able to fluidly move between genders throughout different ceremonies, but then face discrimination from Chilean society and fellow Machis themselves. One Machi states, “Here people don’t talk much about homosexuality because it is looked down upon”. Some Machis are concerned about the way the West portrays Machis, afraid that they are only perceived as homosexuals or ''brujas'' “witches”. One Machi states “Why do anthropologists always say who we are? Why don’t they ask us?” [[Ana Bacigalupo]], a distinguished anthropologist in the field of Machi gender roles, urges people to see the nuances in Machi gender identity and allow complexity to exist.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Machis gendered identities and practices can be experienced and interpreted endlessly along different paths and for different purposes that simultaneously bind people together and draw them apart”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans of the Foye Tree|last=Bacigalupo|first=Ana|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A modern ritual human sacrifice occurred during the devastating [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|earthquake and tsunami of 1960]] by a machi of the Mapuche in the [[Budi Lake|Lago Budi]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Tierney (journalist)|Patrick Tierney]], ''The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice'' (1989) {{ISBN|978-0-14-013974-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim, five-year-old José Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Painecur (the victim's grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumored to be at the behest of local machi, Juana Namuncurá Añen. The two men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after two years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had "acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition." The arrested men's explanation was: "We were asking for calm in the sea and on the earth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869529,00.html "Asking for Calm."] ''Time Magazine''. 4 July 1960 (retrieved 28 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''national church''' is a [[Christian church]] associated with a specific [[ethnic group]] or [[nation state]]. The idea was notably discussed during the [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th century]], during the emergence of modern [[nationalism]].

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in a draft discussing the question of [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] around 1828 wrote that 
:"a National Church might exist, and has existed, without [Christianity], because before the institution of the ''Christian'' Church - as [...] the Levitical Church in the Hebrew Constitution, [and] the [[Druidical]] in the Celtic, would suffice to prove".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

[[John Wordsworth]], Bishop of Salisbury, wrote about the National Church of Sweden in 1911, interpreting the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]] as national churches of the Swedish and the English peoples, respectively. Lake (1987) traces the development of [[Presbyterianism]] in 16th-century England from the status of a "godly minority" which saw itself surrounded by the corrupt or hostile mass of the population, into a "genuine national church".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lake, [[Maria Dowling]], ''Protestantism and the national church in sixteenth century England'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1987, ISBN, 9780709916819, ch. 8 (193ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a national church remains alive in the Protestantism of England and Scandinavia in particular. While, in a context of England, the national church remains a common denominator for the Church of England, some of the Lutheran "'''folk churches'''" of Scandinavia, characterized as national churches in the ethnic sense as opposed to the idea of a state church, emerged in the second half of the 19th century following the lead of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]].&lt;ref&gt;Dag Thorkildsen, "Scandinavia: Lutheranism and national identity" in ''World Christianities, c. 1815-1914'', vol. 8 of ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'', eds.

This declaration implies that the Danish State does not take a neutral stand in religious matters. Nevertheless, freedom of religion has been incorporated in the Constitution. Nielsen (1992, 77) gives a short description of the position of the minority religious communities in comparison to that of the State Church: The Lutheran established church is a department of the state. Church affairs are government by a central government ministry, and clergy are government employees. The registration of births, deaths and marriages falls under this ministry of church affairs, and normally speaking the local Lutheran pastor is also the official registrar. The other small religious communities, viz. Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists and Jews, have the constitutional status of 'recognised communities of faith'. ... Contrary to the minority religious communities, the Lutheran Church is fully financed by the Danish State.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Greece]],&lt;ref name="EnyediMadeley2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enyedi|first1=Zsolt|last2=Madeley|first2=John T.S.|title=Church and State in Contemporary Europe|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135761417|page=228|quote=Both as a state church and as a national church, the Orthodox Church of Greece has a lot in common with Protestant state churches, and even with Catholicism in some countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816069835|page=283|quote=When Iceland obtained home rule in 1874, the new constitution, while granting religious freedom, maintained the Evangelical Lutheran Church as "a national church . . . supported by the State." This was reaffirmed in the 1944 constitution of the new independent Republic of Iceland. Democratic reforms were adopted early in the 20th century that allowed for some independent decision making in parish councils, and let congregations choose their own pastors. Under a 1998 law, the church became largely autonomous, though it is still designated established church, supported by government taxes. At the end of the 19th century, Lutherans who wanted freedom from the state church founded the Evangelical Free Church of Iceland, which now has in excess of 7,000 members. The majority of Icelanders are members of the state church. Almost all children are baptized as Lutheran and more than 90 percent are subsequently confirmed. The Church conducts 75 percent of all marriages and 99 percent of all funerals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural religion''' most frequently means the "religion of nature", in which God, the soul, spirits, and all objects of the supernatural are considered as part of [[nature]] and not separate from it. Conversely, it is also used in [[philosophy]], specifically Roman Catholic philosophy, to describe some aspects of religion that are said to be knowable apart from divine revelation through logic and reason alone (see [[natural theology]] and [[Deism]]), for example, the existence of the [[God|unmoved Mover]], the [[first cause]] of the universe.

Most authors{{who|date=September 2018}} consider natural religion as not only the foundation of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but also distinct from them. According to some authors{{who|date=September 2018}}, aspects of natural religion are found universally among all peoples, often in such forms of [[shamanism]] and [[animism]]. They are still practiced in many parts of the world. The religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies for example are considered as possessing some aspects of natural religion.

==Definition==

Natural religion might have the following meanings:

* In the modern [[Religious studies|study of religion]] it is used to refer to the notion that there is a spontaneous religious apprehension of the world common to all human beings, see:
**[[urreligion]]
**[[origin of religion]]
**[[anthropology of religion]]
* As a reverent form of [[nature worship]], embodied in a statement by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: "I put a capital N on Nature, and call it my Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/wright_frank_lloyd_t.html |title=Frank Lloyd Wright |publisher=[[The Mike Wallace Interview]] |year=1957 |website=[[Harry Ransom Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referring to the religions of people prior to their [[Christianization]].

==History==

The basic tenets of natural religion were outlined by [[Aristotle]], whose ''hylomorphism'' considered all things as made of matter and form. The form of all living things is the [[soul]], which guides and directs their development. Many natural religions{{which|date=September 2018}} consider God as the "soul of the universe".

Early [[monotheism]] had many naturalistic elements. Heaven and hell were considered physical places above and below the earth. "Salvation" was considered resurrection of the body.

In the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and under the influence of both [[gnosticism]] and [[neoplatonism]], developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of [[limbo]] for unbaptized persons and [[purgatory]] for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..

Another distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws. Christians had to separate God more completely from the natural universe in order to show how this could be possible. There were similar neoplatonist tendencies in Judaism and Islam, which also saw God as acting in history.

Natural religions, on the contrary, consider the supernatural as part of the natural universe.

==Modern views==
One of the first attempts to develop a science of religion was ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by the American philosopher [[William James]].  James saw the basic experience which unified all religions as a sometimes life-changing personal event in which one perceives the connectedness of all things as one unified whole.

James defined the basics of all religion, including natural religion, when he wrote: "Were one to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it exists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hereto."

Certain aspects of natural religion (that is, religious truths that are knowable by human reason alone) are found among different cultures, though not always entirely intact, and to varying degrees, according to philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]].

A few modern scientists such as UK biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]] believe new discoveries coincide with Aristotle's belief in the soul. Forces such as [[magnetism]], [[gravity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] also point to non-material forces acting in nature.&lt;ref&gt;2012. Sheldrake, R. '''Set Science Free: 10 Paths to New Discoveries.''' Depak Chopra.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omniscience''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|m|ˈ|n|ɪ|ʃ|ə|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|omniscience}}"&lt;/ref&gt; is the capacity to know everything. In [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Sikhism]] and the [[Abrahamic religions]], this is an [[God#Specific attributes|attribute of God]]. In some other religions that do not include a supreme deity, such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], omniscience is an attribute that any individual can eventually attain.

== Islam ==
In Islam, [[Allah]] is attributed with absolute omniscience. He knows the past, the present and the future. It is compulsory for a [[Muslim]] to believe that Allah is indeed omniscient as stated in one of the  [[Iman_(concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of faith]] which is :
* To believe that Allah’s divine decree and predestination 

{{Quote|“Say: Do you instruct Allah about your religion? But Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on the earth; Allah is Knowing of all things” 
-Holy Qur'an (49:16)|}}

It is however, believed that human can only change their [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]] (wealth, health, deed etc.) and not divine decree (date of birth, date of death, family etc.), thus allowing free wills.

== Buddhism ==
&lt;!--"Ananda" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.--&gt;
The topic of omniscience has been much debated in various Indian traditions, but no more so than by the Buddhists. After [[Dharmakirti]]'s excursions into the subject of [[pramana|what constitutes a valid cognition]], [[Śāntarakṣita]] and his student [[Kamalaśīla]] thoroughly investigated the subject in the [[Tattvasamgraha]] and its commentary the Panjika. The arguments in the text can be broadly grouped into four sections:
* The refutation that cognitions, either perceived, inferred, or otherwise, can be used to refute omniscience.
* A demonstration of the possibility of omniscience through apprehending the selfless universal nature of all knowables, by examining what it means to be ignorant and the nature of mind and awareness.
* A demonstration of the total omniscience where all individual characteristics (svalaksana) are available to the omniscient being.
* The specific demonstration of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s non-exclusive omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Sara L. (2010). ''Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason''. Wisdom Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Attributes of God}}
{{See also|Attributes of God in Christianity}}
Some modern [[Christian]] [[theologian]]s argue that God's omniscience is inherent rather than total, and that God chooses to limit his omniscience in order to preserve the freewill and dignity of his creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]], ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]], among other theologians of the 16th century, comfortable with the definition of God as being omniscient in the total sense, in order for worthy beings' abilities to choose freely, embraced the doctrine of [[predestination]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Kevala Jnana}}
In [[Jainism]], omniscience is considered the highest type of perception. In the words of a Jain scholar,
"The perfect manifestation of the innate nature of the self, arising on the complete annihilation of the obstructive veils, is called omniscience."{{sfn|Mehta|1954|p= 99}}

Jainism views infinite knowledge as an inherent capability of every soul. ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihanta]]'' is the word used by Jains to refer to those human beings who have conquered all inner passions (like attachment, greed, pride, anger) and possess ''Kevala Jnana'' (infinite knowledge). They are said to be of two kinds:{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
# ''Sāmānya kevali'' – omniscient beings (''Kevalins'') who are concerned with their own liberation.
# ''[[Tirthankara]] kevali'' – human beings who attain omniscience and then help others to achieve the same.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|left|''Omniciencia'', mural by [[José Clemente Orozco]]]]
{{seealso|Determinism|Free will|Argument from free will}}
Whether omniscience, particularly regarding the choices that a human will make, is compatible with [[free will]] has been debated by [[Theology|theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]]. The argument that divine foreknowledge is not compatible with free will is known as [[theological fatalism]]. It is argued that if humans are free to choose between alternatives, God could not know what this choice will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/~rbarnett/phi/free.html |title=Ron Barnette, a Bright-OMNISCIENCE AND FREEDOM |publisher=Valdosta.edu |date=1999-09-16 |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422202913/http://www.valdosta.edu/~rbarnett/phi/free.html |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A question arises: if an omniscient entity knows everything, even about its own decisions in the future, does it therefore forbid any free will to that entity? [[William Lane Craig]] states that the question subdivides into two:
# If God foreknows the occurrence of some event E, does E happen necessarily?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Purtill on Fatalism and Truth|journal=Faith and Philosophy|date=1990|pages=229–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# If some event E is contingent, how can God foreknow E’s occurrence?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2771 |journal=Process Studies |pages=30–37 |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1989 |title=Does Omniscience Imply Foreknowledge? Craig on Hartshorneby |first=Donald Wayne |last=Viney |accessdate=5 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102032031/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2771 |archivedate=2 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this kind of argument fails to recognize its use of the [[modal fallacy]]. It is possible to show that the first premise of arguments like these is fallacious. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow/#SH6b |title=Foreknowledge and Free Will |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430091819/https://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow/ |archivedate=30 April 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm#omniscience |title='The' Modal Fallacy |publisher=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/ |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809215754/https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm |archivedate=9 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omniscience and the privacy of conscious experience ==
Some philosophers, such as Patrick Grim, [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]], Stephan Torre and William Mander have discussed the issue of whether the apparent exclusively first-person nature of conscious experience is compatible with God's omniscience. There is a strong sense in which conscious experience is private, meaning that no outside observer can gain knowledge of what it is like to be me ''as me''. If a subject cannot know what it is like to be another subject in an objective manner, the question is whether that limitation applies to God as well. If it does, then God cannot be said to be omniscient since there is then a form of knowledge that God lacks access to.

The philosopher Patrick Grim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grim|first=Patrick|date=1985|title=Against omniscience: The case from essential indexicals|journal=Noûs|volume=19|pages=151–180|jstor=2214928}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably raised this issue. Linda Zagzebski&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Omnisubjectivity : a defense of a divine attribute|last=1946-|first=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus|isbn=9780874621839|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|oclc=825106425|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to avoid it by introducing the notion of ''perfect empathy'', a proposed relation that God can have to subjects that would allow God to have perfect knowledge of their conscious experience. William Mander&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mander|first=William|date=2000|title=Does God know what it is like to be me?|journal=Heythrop Journal|volume=43|issue=4|pages=430–443|doi=10.1111/1468-2265.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that God can only have such knowledge if our experiences are part of God's broader experience. Stephan Torre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Stephan|date=2006|title=De Se Knowledge and the Possibility of an Omniscient Being|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/faithphil/content/faithphil_2006_0023_0002_0191_0200|journal=Faith and Philosophy|volume=23|pages=191–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that God can have such knowledge if self-knowledge involves the ascription of properties, either to oneself or to others. Patrick Grim saw this line of reasoning as a motivation for accepting atheism.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to religion:

'''[[Religion]]''' &amp;ndash; organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence. Many religions have narratives, symbols, and sacred histories that are intended to explain the meaning of life and/or to explain the origin of life or the Universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.

{{Zoroastrianism}}

A '''Parsi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|s|iː}}) or '''Parsee''' ("[[Persian people|Persian]]" in the [[Persian language]]) refers to a member of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community who migrated to India (mainly; including present day Pakistan) from [[Persia]] during the Arab invasion of 636–651 AD; one of two (the other being [[Irani (India)|Iranis]]) mainly located in [[India]], with a few in [[Pakistan]]. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', Parsis migrated from [[Greater Iran]] to [[Gujarat]], where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century AD to avoid [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].&lt;ref name="Hodivala 1920 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Hodivala|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boy148"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann205"&gt;{{harvnb|Lambton|1981|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns42"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan17&gt;{{harvnb|Khanbaghi|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1906|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|Widengren|1971|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the [[Sasanian Empire]]) was [[Zoroastrianism]]. Iranians rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Muslim-Conquest-Persia-I-Akram/dp/0954866533|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|last=Akram|first=A. I.|last2=al-Mehri|first2=A. B.|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Maktabah Publications|isbn=9780954866532}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time many Iranians (who are now called Parsis) chose to preserve their religious identity by fleeing from Persia to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/parsi-communities-i-early-history PARSI COMMUNITIES i. EARLY HISTORY – Encyclopaedia Iranica]. Iranicaonline.org (2008-07-20). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|fa|پارسیان}}, pronounced "Parsian", i.e., "Parsi" in the [[Persian language]], literally means ''Persian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138161 Parsee, n. and adj. - Oxford English Dictionary]. oed.com. Retrieved on 2015-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Farsi is the official language of modern [[Iran]], which was formerly known as Persia, and the [[Persian language]]'s [[endonym]] is ''Farsi'', an [[arabization]] of the word ''Parsi''.

The long presence of the Parsis in the [[India|Indian subcontinent]] distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=Kamala|date=2008|title=Intra-community Dissent and Dialogue: The Bombay Parsis and the Zoroastrian Diaspora|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23620804|journal=Sociological Bulletin|volume=57|issue=3|pages=315–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]]. The Parsis, whose name means "Persians", are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities near by in Karachi (Pakistan) and Bangalore (Karnataka, India). There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Hyderabad. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Chennai. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the [[Persian Gulf]], but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may in fact have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at [[Diu, India|Diu]] in [[Kathiawar]] but soon moved to south Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444672/Parsi Parsi (people) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Pārsi'', which in the Persian language is a [[demonym]] meaning "inhabitant of [[Fars Province|Pārs]]" and hence "ethnic Persian", is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms ''Zartoshti'' "Zoroastrian" or ''Vehdin'' "[of] the good religion". The 12th-century ''Sixteen [[Shloka]]s'', a [[Sanskrit]] text in praise of the Parsis,&lt;ref&gt;Parsi legend attributes it to a Hindu author; [[cf.]] {{Harvard citation no brackets|Paymaster|1954|p=8}} incorrectly attributes the text to a Zoroastrian priest&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.

[[File:Indian - Leaf from Bound Collection of 20 Miniatures Depicting Village Life - Walters 35176H.jpg|thumb|Parsis from India, c. 1870]]
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, [[Jordanus]], briefly refers to their presence in [[Thane]] and [[Bharuch]]. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician [[Garcia de Orta]] observed in 1563 that "there are merchants ... in the kingdom of [[Khambhat|Cambaia]] ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are [[Gentile|Gentios]]." In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see [[#Self-perceptions|self-perceptions]], below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that "Parsi" was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians.{{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}} {{Harvtxt|Boyce|2002|p=105}} notes that in much the same way as the word "Hindu" was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, "Parsi" was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term "Parsi" itself is "not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity" {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I. 373}}. Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as [[Parthia]]ns according to the ''Qissa-i Sanjan''. {{Harvard citation|Boyce|2002|p=105}}

The term "Parseeism" or "Parsiism" is attributed to [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], who in the 1750s, when the word "Zoroastrianism" had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the Parsi identity was well truly an identity even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Parsis is found in the Assyrian inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] (circa 854-824 BC).
* [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, “parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra”, meaning, “a Parsi, the son of a Parsi, an [[Aryan]], of Aryan family (Inscription at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]], near [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]).
* In Outlines of Parsi History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3-4 writes, “According to the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of [[Karnamak-i Ardeshir-i Papakan|Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan]], the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan ‘the king of the Parsis’.
* [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC referred to Iranians as Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani (1966) 68 Bom. L.R. 794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good ([[Ohrmazd]]) and evil ([[Angra Mainyu]]) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the ''[[asha]]'' or the righteousness and ''[[druj]]'' or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the [[Chinvat bridge]] to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the ''Avesta'', was written in the [[Avestan language]], which is closely related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

The ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a [[fire temple]].

=== As an ethnic community ===
[[Image:Parsi wedding portrait with Dastur MN Dhalla.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding portrait, 1948]]
Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of [[consanguinity]] or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. &lt;!-- religion, and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] --&gt;
[[Genealogical DNA test]]s to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention {{Harvard citation|Nanavutty|1970|p=13}} that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome]] (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of [[Pakistan]], it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours {{Harv |Qamar|Ayub|Mohyuddin|Helgason|2002| p=1119}}.

A 2004 study in which Parsi [[mitochondrial DNA]] (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] determined that Parsis (in Gujarat, but not in other parts of India) are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested "a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin" {{Harvard citation|Quintana-Murci|Chaix|Wells|Behar|2004|p=840}}. To put all the doubts to rest a deeper study was conducted in 2017 [https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9 “Like sugar in milk”: reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population] which confirms that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East.

=== Self-perceptions ===
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the [[navjote]] ceremony.

In this sense, ''Parsi'' is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]] in the West.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of [[gender equality]] and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

{{quote|the Parsi community consists of: a) Parsis who are descended from the original Persian emigrants and who are born of both Zoroastrian parents and who profess the Zoroastrian religion; b) Iranis [here meaning [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], not the other group of Indian Zoroastrians] professing the Zoroastrian religion; c) the children of Parsi fathers by alien mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit v. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhai|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] void the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. {{Harvard citation|Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar v. Merwan Rashid Yezdiar|1948}} On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an [[obiter dictum]] – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). ({{Harvnb|Merwan Rashid Yezdiar v. Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar|1950}}; {{Harvnb|Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani|1966}}).

Nonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.

== Population {{anchor|Demographics}} ==
{{See also|List of countries by Zoroastrian population}}

According to the [[2011 Census of India]], there are 57,264 Parsis in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/where-we-belong-the-fight-of-parsi-women-in-interfaith-marriages-4900480/|title=Where we belong: The fight of Parsi women in interfaith marriages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Parsi-population-dips-by-22-per-cent-between-2001-2011-study/article14508859.ece|title=Parsi population dips by 22 per cent between 2001-2011: study}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Commission for Minorities]], there are a "variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community", the most significant of which were childlessness and migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=8, 21}}). Demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000.&lt;!-- Taraporevala|2000|p=9 --&gt; The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a '[[tribe]]'. &lt;!-- "cease to be termed a community and will be labelled {{sic}} a 'tribe'" --&gt;({{Harvnb|Taraporevala|2000|p=9}}).

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=21}}). A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest&lt;!-- infant mortality is the other possibility, but is negligible among Parsis--&gt;: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=14}}). Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02wmp5q|title=Saving India’s Parsis|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various factors that have led to the decline in Parsi community a few are listed below:

1.Late Marriage &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As most of the Parsi women, usually go abroad to seek higher education and are usually more qualified than Parsi men. They would like to stand up on their own- two feet and fetch for themselves. Causing them to get married late as a result of their work. 

2. Fertility Rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married late, the fertility rate decreases in women and their chances of conceiving decreases. 

3. Conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsi religion doesn't allow inter- caste marriage, only intra-caste. Hence, if a women gets married to a non- Parsi she is not sought to be a part of the community and is often discarded. She is not allowed to visit the fire temple, not allowed to attended her fathers funeral, do her childs Navjote Ceremony and is often neglected by her parents. 

4. Illnesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married in their own community since decades, the Parsi gene pool is rather weak and more prone to illness such as cancer, osteoporosis etc. Hence, they are more susceptible to illnesses and their death rates are higher than birth rates.  

&lt;br /&gt;

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high [[literacy rate]]; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in [[urban area]]s (the national average is 27.8%).

In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=18, 19}})

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian sub-continent ===
According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]], the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This historical region of [[Central Asia]] is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern [[Khorasan Province]], part of western/northern [[Afghanistan]], and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

According to the ''Qissa'', the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, [[Jadi Rana]], on the condition that they adopt the local language ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]) and that their women adopt local dress (the ''[[sari]]'').{{sfn|Hodivala|1920}} The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ([[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]], near [[Merv]], modern Turkmenistan).{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the ''alat''). In addition to these ''Khorasani''s or ''Kohistani''s "mountain folk", as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called,{{sfn|Vimadalal|1979|p=2}} at least one other group is said to have come overland from [[Sari, Iran]].{{sfn|Paymaster|1954}}

[[File:IslamicConquestsIroon.png|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and its surrounding regions on the eve of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]]]
Although the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the ''Qissa'', which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis".{{sfn|Taraporevala|2000}} Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the ''Qissa'' lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, "even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography."{{sfn|Kulke|1978|p=25}}

The Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Sindh]] touching [[Balochistan]], the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Even following the loss of [[Sindh]], the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The 9th-century Arab historiographer [[Al-Masudi]] briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I.374}} There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh.&lt;ref name="Hinnells2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHEc31SZStsC|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora:Religion and Migration: Religion and Migration|author=John R. Hinnells|date=28 April 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbours of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland [[Silk Road]] and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the [[Common Era]], and both the [[Puranas]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' use the term ''[[Parasika]]s'' to refer to the peoples west of the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}

"Parsi legends regarding their ancestors' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}{{sfn|Paymaster|1954|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Boyce|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Lambton|1981|p=205}} {{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}) However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the "traditional" 8th century date (as deduced from the ''Qissa'') is considered valid, it must be assumed "that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran [and] economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}} This would have been particularly the case if – as the ''Qissa'' suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on [[Silk Road]] trade {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}}. Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a [[chaplain]] with the [[British East India Company]], noted that the Parsis came to India seeking "[[liberty of conscience]]" but simultaneously arrived as "merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise." The fact that Muslims charged non-Muslims higher duties when trading from Muslim-held ports may be interpreted to be a form of religious persecution, but this being the only reason to migrate appears unlikely.

=== Early years ===
The ''Qissa'' has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the "Fire of Victory" (Middle Persian: ''[[Atash Bahram]]'') at Sanjan and its subsequent move to [[Navsari]]. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were "full of hardships" (''sic'') before Zoroastrianism "gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=447}}

Two centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to "difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction."{{Harvard citation|Kulke|1978|p=29}} These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five ''panthak''s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the ''Atash Bahram'' led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five ''panthak'' families.)

Inscriptions at the [[Kanheri Caves]] near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, [[Middle Persian]] was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the ''Qissa'' and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when "masterly"{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}} Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the [[Avesta]] and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that "religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period" and that the command of [[Middle Persian]] and Sanskrit among the clerics "was of a superior order".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}}.

From the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians "better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=457}}. These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the ''[[rivayat]]''s ([[epistle]]s) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these ''ithoter'' ("questions") are remarkably trivial – for instance, ''Rivayat'' 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying [[Avestan language]] texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of ''Juddin''s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|pp=474–475}}

Nonetheless, "the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former [[proselytizing]] zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=474}}. Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the [[social stratification]] that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the ''asronih'' in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the ''(r)atheshtarih'' (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), ''vastaryoshih'' (farmers and herdsmen), ''hutokshih'' (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the ''behdini'' ("followers of ''daena''", for which "good religion" is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century British colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the [[Indian caste system|Hindu caste system]] (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).

=== Age of opportunity ===
Following the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] and [[James I]] of England, the [[East India Company]] obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in [[Surat]] and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the [[Seven Islands of Bombay]] from [[Charles II of England]]. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.&lt;!--{{Harvnb|Hull|1913}}--&gt;{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=47–57}}

Where literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to "represent themselves as being like the British," which they did "more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community".{{sfn|Luhrmann|2002|p=861}} While the British saw the other Indians "as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful",{{sfn|Luhrmann|1994|p=333}} the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the colonial authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. [[Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo]] (1638) saw them as "diligent", "conscientious", and "skillful" in their [[mercantile]] pursuits. Similar observations would be made by [[James Mackintosh]], Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that "the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}

One of these was an enterprising agent named [[Rustom Maneck Seth|Rustom Maneck]]. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name "Seth" in the process), and in the following years "he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the [[Bombay Presidency]] were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now [[Bharuch]]), would note in his ''Oriental Memoirs'' (1770): "many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees." &lt;!-- [...] ---&gt; "Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company's subjects on the western shores of [[Hindustan]] where they are highly esteemed".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China.The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palsetia|first1=Jesse S.|title=The Parsis of India : preservation of identity in Bombay City|date=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9789004121140|pages=53–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=opium+parsi&amp;ots=cUcgUz8fym&amp;sig=MXhuA5W74fJHqoa9h67egxE9JRc#v=onepage&amp;q=opium%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually certain families "acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises."{{sfn|Hull|1913}}{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=37–45, 62-64, 128-140, 334-135}}).

Through his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so "established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant [[Maratha]]s, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 "fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay".{{sfn|White|1991|p=312}} Maneck's generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family "assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe".{{sfn|Ovington|1929|p=216}}

In 1728 Rustom's eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the ''Bombay Parsi [[Panchayat]]'' (in the sense of an instrument for [[self-governance]] and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community.{{sfn|Karaka|1884|pp=215–217}} Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the ''[[The Times of India|Bombay Times]]'' noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the ''Bundobusts'' or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community.{{sfn|Dobbin|1970|pp=150–151}} In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized "Parsi Matrimonial Court". Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=223–225}}

At about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of [[structural cohesion|social cohesiveness]] that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=135–139}} Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]] founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary [[Maneckji Limji Hataria]] may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the [[jizya]] for their co-religionists in 1882.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as "the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity".{{sfn|Dhalla|1948|p=483}} By the close of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting 6% of the total population of the city (Census, 1881){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.

Nonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community&lt;!-- {Palsetia|2001}--&gt;. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into [[Parsi theatre]], literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, [[Scouting]] troops, clubs, and [[Masonic Lodge]]s. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], the first Asian to occupy a seat in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would note: "Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian".{{sfn|Ralhan|2002|p=1101}}

== Religious practices ==
The main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.

=== Purity and pollution ===
The balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.

=== [[Navjote]] ===
Zoroastrians are not initiated by [[infant baptism]]. Normally, a child is initiated into the faith when he or she is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, [[sedreh|sudre]], and [[Kushti|kusti]]. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is complete and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.

=== Marriage ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}{{main|Zoroastrian wedding}}
[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|Parsi wedding 1905.]]
Marriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.

=== Funerals ===

{{main|Dakhma}}
[[File:Parsee Tower of Silence, Bombay.jpg|thumb|Parsi Tower of Silence, Bombay.]]
The pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.

=== Temples ===
[[File:Parsi Fire Temple of Ahmedabad - Gujarat, India (4586854549).jpg|thumb|Parsi Fire Temple of [[Ahmedabad]], India]]
Zoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.

== Factions within the community ==
[[Image:Parsi-jashan-ceremony-1.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''Jashan'' ceremony (in this case, a house blessing)]]

=== Calendrical differences ===
''This section contains information specific to the Parsi calendar. For information on the calendar used by the Zoroastrians for religious purposes, including details on its history and its variations, see [[Zoroastrian calendar]].''

Until about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of [[Ardashir I of Persia|Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.

Sometime between 1125 and 1250 (''[[cf.]]'' {{Harvnb|Boyce|1970|p=537}}), the Parsis inserted an [[embolismic month]] to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, ''Shahenshahi'' (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.

In 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the ''Kadmi'' or ''Kadimi'' calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar as being "royalist".

In 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] model: the ''Fasili'', or ''Fasli'', calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year's day that fell on the day of the [[vernal equinox]]. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]'' 3.419){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- Should have matching reference in reference list for Denkard--&gt;.

Today the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar although the ''Kadmi'' calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The ''Fasli'' calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the ''Bastani'' calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the ''Fasli'' calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.

==== Effect of the calendar disputes ====
Since some of the [[Avesta]] prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is "correct" also has theological ramifications.

To further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the ''Kadmi'' calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the ''Kadmi'' calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of [[Avestan language]] and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the ''Kadmi''s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-''Kadmi'' Parsis.

The calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a ''Shahenshahi'' resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young ''Kadmi'' woman and so causing her to miscarry.

Of the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of [[fire temple]]) in India, three follow the ''Kadmi'' pronunciation and calendar, the other five are ''Shahenshahi''. The ''Fassali''s do not have their own Atash-Behram.

=== Ilm-e-Kshnoom ===
{{Main|Ilm-e-Kshnoom}}
The ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom'' ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (alternatively, in the [[Alborz]] range, around [[Mount Damavand]]).

There are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their ''Kusti'' prayers are very similar to those used by the ''Fassali''s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.

The largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (''Parsi Pukar''). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in [[Surat]], where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.

=== Issues relating to the deceased ===
[[File:St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth 17.JPG|thumb|Parsi funerary monument, [[St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth|St Mary’s Cemetery, Wandsworth]]]]
It has been traditional, in Mumbai and [[Karachi]] at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's [[vultures]]. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/16/rspb.2009.0071.full Cellular and humoral immunodepression in vultures feeding upon medicated livestock carrion]. Rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anti-inflammatory [[diclofenac]], both of which harm vultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peregrinefund.org/news-release/250 News Release]. The Peregrine Fund (2012-08-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue led to the [[Indian vulture crisis]], which led to the ban of the drug [[diclofenac]]. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the [[decomposition]] process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In [[Peshawar]] a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no [[Tower of Silence]]. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing off their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.

The Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]] is located at [[Malabar Hill]]. In [[Karachi]], the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the [[Chanesar Goth]] and [[Mahmudabad, Karachi|Mehmoodabad]] localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/386604/Tower-of-Silence Tower of Silence, Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and [[Y-chromosome]] DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis have a high frequency of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]] (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely even though they had a small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Lluís|last2=Chaix|first2=Raphaëlle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

A study published in ''[[Genome Biology]]'' based on high density [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian and Caucasus populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago. It is also found that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians who had recently received the genes from the Near East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Pious fraud''' is used to describe [[fraud]] in [[religion]] or medicine. A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a [[miracle]] or falsely attributing a [[Pseudepigraph|sacred text to a biblical figure]] due to the belief that the "[[Consequentialism|end justifies the means]]", in this case the end of increasing [[faith]] by whatever means available.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for definition of term|date=February 2011}}

==Use of the phrase==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports the phrase was first used in English in 1678. [[Edward Gibbon]] was particularly fond of the phrase, using it often in his monumental and controversial work ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in which he criticized the likelihood of some of the [[martyr]]s and miracles of the early [[Christian]] church.

[[William W. Howells]] wrote that [[shaman]]s know that their tricks are impostures, but that all who studied them agree that they really believe in their power to deal with [[spirit]]s. According to Howells, their main purpose is an honest one and they believe that this justifies the means of hoodwinking his followers in minor technical matters.&lt;ref&gt;William Howells,  1962. ''The Heathens: Primitive Man and his Religions'' [[New York City]]: [[National Museum of American History]] [http://www.amnh.org/] in Robert S. Ellwood ''Civilized Shamans: Sacred Biography and Founders of [[New Religious Movement]]s'',  in ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and Reender Kranenborg (Studies in New Religions [[Aarhus University]] Press) 2003 {{ISBN|87-7288-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thomas Jefferson==
{{See also|Religious views of Thomas Jefferson}}
[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to a doctor-friend in 1805:
{{quote|One of the most successful physicians I have ever known, has assured me, that he used more bread pills, drops of coloured water, and powders of hickory ashes, than of all other medicines put together. It was certainly a pious fraud.|"Placebo Effects and Science Journalism at the Mind/Body Boundary". Steve Silberman, The Journal of Mind-Body Regulation, 2011}}

==Isaac Newton==
In [[Isaac Newton]]'s dissertation, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'', he blames the "Roman Church" for many abuses in the world, accusing it of "pious frauds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Qīngtán''''' ({{zh|t=清談|w=Ch'ing&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-t'an&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|l=pure conversation}}) was a movement related to [[Taoism]] that developed during the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]-[[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] ({{lang|zh|魏晉}}) period and continued on through the [[Southern and Northern dynasties]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163009">Various aspects of the '''relationship between religion and science''' have been cited by modern historians of science and religion, philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others from various geographical regions and cultures. Even though the ancient and medieval worlds did not have conceptions resembling the modern understandings of "science" and "religion", certain elements of these modern ideas are found throughout history. It was in the 19th century when the phrases "religion and science" or "science and religion" first emerged in literature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; This coincided with the refining of "science", from the studies of "[[natural philosophy]]", and "[[religion]]" as distinct concepts in the last few centuries partly due to professionalization of the sciences, the Protestant Reformation, colonization, and globalization.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt; Since then, many have characterized the relationship as either conflict, harmony, complexity, or mutual independence.

Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stenmark|first1=Mikael|title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model|page=45|date=2004|publisher=W.B.

Science Before the Greeks (On changes in science here)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the [[scientific revolution]] were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the [[scientific method]] were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. [[Roger Bacon]], who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient [[Mahābhūta|Indians]] and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|Greeks]] into [[Classical elements|air, earth, fire and water]] was more philosophical, medieval [[Science in the medieval Islamic world#Notable scientists|Middle Easterns]] used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.&lt;ref name=Jim&gt;''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in Europe such as the [[Galileo affair]], associated with the scientific revolution and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], led scholars such as [[John William Draper]] to postulate a [[conflict thesis]], holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by some contemporary scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Peter Atkins]], and [[Donald Prothero]]. The conflict thesis has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science.&lt;ref name="Russel, C.A. 2002 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russel, C.A.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=7|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapin1996&gt;{{cite book| author = Shapin, S.| year = 1996| title = The Scientific Revolution| page = 195| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn =| quote = In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the 'warfare between science and religion' and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict.

Many scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout history, such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]], [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Francis Collins]], have seen compatibility or independence between religion and science. Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], other scientists, and some contemporary theologians hold that religion and science are [[non-overlapping magisteria]], addressing fundamentally separate forms of knowledge and aspects of life.  Some theologians or historians of science, including [[John Lennox]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[Brian Swimme]] and [[Ken Wilber]] propose an interconnection between science and religion, while others such as [[Ian Barbour]] believe there are even parallels.

Public acceptance of [[Fact#Fact in science|scientific facts]] may be influenced by religion; many in the [[United States]] reject evolution by [[natural selection]], especially regarding human beings. Nevertheless, the American [[National Academy of Sciences]] has written that "the evidence for evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith", a view officially endorsed by many religious denominations globally.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Evolution and Creationism|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|year=2008|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11876.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of "science" and "religion" are a recent invention: "religion" emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation,&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Religion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; "science" emerged in the 19th century in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=3–4|isbn=0-226-48214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; Originally what is today known as "science" was pioneered as "natural philosophy". Furthermore, the phrase "religion and science" or "science and religion" emerged in the 19th century, not before, due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-18448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226317838|pages=254–255, 259, 260|chapter=10.

It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-08928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and it was applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "[[natural philosophy]]" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-68957-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Newton's book [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait's, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled [[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]] (1867).

It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name="Before Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nongbri|first1=Brent|title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-15416-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; In the 19th century, [[Max Müller]] noted that what is called ancient religion today, would have been called "law" in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] word "[[dharma]]", sometimes translated as "religion", also means law or duty. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The development of sciences (especially [[natural philosophy]])  in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], has considerable foundation in the works of the Arabs who translated [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[Classical antiquity|compositions.]]&lt;ref name="Grant1990"&gt;Grant, E. (1990, December 12). ''Science and Religion in the Middle Ages''. Speech presented at "Science and Religion in the Middle Ages," in Harvard University, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Aristotle]] played a major role in the institutionalization, systematization, and expansion of reason. [[Christianity]] accepted reason within the ambit of faith. In [[Christendom]], reason was considered subordinate to [[revelation]], which contained the ultimate truth and this truth could not be challenged. Even though the medieval Christian had the urge to use their reason, they had little on which to exercise it. In medieval universities, the faculty for natural philosophy and theology were separate, and discussions pertaining to theological issues were often not allowed to be undertaken by the faculty of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God and Reason in the Middle Ages|last=Grant|first=Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-511-03262-5|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

Natural philosophy, as taught in the arts faculties of the universities, was seen as an essential area of study in its own right and was considered necessary for almost every area of study. It was an independent field, separated from theology, which enjoyed a good deal of intellectual freedom as long as it was restricted to the natural world. In general, there was religious support for natural science by the late Middle Ages and a recognition that it was an important element of learning.&lt;ref name="Grant1990" /&gt;

The extent to which medieval science led directly to the new philosophy of the scientific revolution remains a subject for debate, but it certainly had a significant influence.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

The Middle Ages laid ground for the developments that took place in science, during the [[Renaissance]] which immediately succeeded it. With significant developments taking place in science, mathematics, medicine and philosophy, the relationship between science and religion became one of curiosity and questioning.&lt;ref name="Hall1994"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Renaissance, 1450-1630|last=Hall|first=Marie Boas|publisher=Dover publications|origyear=1962|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} As [[humanism]] became more and more popular, people tried to understand the nature around them better, rather than turn to religious aspirations. Renaissance humanism looked to classical Greek and Roman texts to change contemporary thought, allowing for a new mindset after the Middle Ages. Renaissance readers understood these [[Classics|classical texts]] as focusing on human decisions, actions and creations, rather than blindly following the rules set forth by the Catholic Church as "God's plan." Though many Renaissance humanists remained religious, they believed God gave humans opportunities and it was humanity's duty to do the "best and most moral thing". Renaissance humanism was an "ethical theory and practice that emphasized reason, scientific inquiry and human fulfillment in the natural world," said [[Susan Abernethy|Abernethy]].&lt;ref name="Szalay2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55230-renaissance.html|title=The Renaissance: The 'Rebirth' of Science &amp; Culture|last=Szalay|first=Jessie|date=June 29, 2016&lt;!-- 11:09am ET--&gt;|website=www.livescience.com|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1630, ancient authority from classical literature and philosophy, as well as their necessity, started eroding, although scientists were still expected to be fluent in [[New Latin|Latin]], the international language of Europe's intellectuals. With the sheer success of science and the steady advance of [[rationalism]], the individual scientist gained prestige.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

Along with the inventions of this period, especially the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], allowed for the dissemination of the [[Bible]] in languages of the common people (languages other than Latin). This allowed more people to read and learn from the scripture, leading to the [[Evangelism|Evangelical movement]]. The people who spread this message, concentrated more on [[Individualism|individual agency]] rather than the structures of the Church.&lt;ref name="Szalay2016" /&gt;

== Perspectives ==
[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|According to [[Richard Dawkins]], "Not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism?language=en Richard Dawkins on militant atheism] ([http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism/transcript?language=en transcript]), [[TED talk]], 2007 (page visited on 21 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The kinds of interactions that might arise between science and religion have been categorized by theologian, Anglican priest, and physicist [[John Polkinghorne]]: (1) conflict between the disciplines, (2) independence of the disciplines, (3) dialogue between the disciplines where they overlap and (4) integration of both into one field.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}} pp. 20–22, following [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology is similar to ones used by theologians [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4aUPT8fmrbYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;vq=typology&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U24Iyg68UM2bEY8idn4TyMV4ViJtw Nature, Human Nature, and God], [[Ian G.

Peacocke]] (ed), [[University of Notre Dame]] press, 1981 {{ISBN|0-268-01704-2}}, pp. xiii–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incompatibility ===
According to Guillermo Paz-y-Miño-C and Avelina Espinosa, the historical conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between [[scientific]] [[rationalism]]/[[empiricism]] and the belief in [[supernatural]] causation.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{cite web|title= The Incompatibility Hypothesis: Evolution versus Supernatural Causation|url=http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Incompatibility_Hypothesis_Evolution_SpCausation_Paz-y-MinoC_Espinosa_2014.pdf|publisher=In Why Does Evolution Matter?

And it offers an educated answer: their intrinsic and opposing approaches to assess reality, i.e. science by means of testing hypotheses, falsifying and/or testing predictions and replication of experiments; religion, in contrast, via belief in supernatural causality. ''Belief'' disrupts, distorts, delays or stops ''(3Ds + S)'' the comprehension and acceptance of scientific evidence.

[[Planetary scientist]] [[Carolyn Porco]] describes a hope that "the confrontation between science and formal religion will come to an end when the role played by science in the lives of all people is the same played by religion today."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11273&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] has stated that religion is the reason "questions about [[evolution]], the age of the earth, cosmology, and human evolution nearly always cause Americans to flunk science literacy tests compared to other nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/09/25/losing-our-religion/|website=Skepticblog|first=Donald|last=Prothero|date=25 September 2013|title=Losing our religion|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jon Miller, who studies science literacy across nations, states that Americans in general are slightly more scientifically literate than Europeans and the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Literacy: How Do Americans Stack Up? |website=Michigan State University |publisher=Science Daily |date=February 27, 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218134322.htm |quote="A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults, but the truth is that no major industrial nation in the world today has a sufficient number of scientifically literate adults."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[cosmologist]] and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], compatibility or incompatibility is a theological concern, not a scientific concern.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;  In [[Lisa Randall]]'s view, questions of incompatibility or otherwise are not answerable, since by accepting revelations one is abandoning rules of logic which are needed to identify if there are indeed contradictions between holding certain beliefs.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] holds that incompatibility exists because religion is not problematic to a certain point before it collapses into a number of excuses for keeping certain beliefs, in light of evolutionary implications.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;

According to [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], the central difference between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars|author= Neil deGrasse Tyson |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson From Natural History Magazine, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]]'s view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches of knowing and the availability of alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J. | authorlink=Victor_J._Stenger | title=God and the folly of faith : the incompatibility of science and religion|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=290–96 |location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=1-61614-599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sean M. Carroll]], since religion makes claims that are not compatible with science, such as supernatural events, therefore both are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=Science and Religion are Not Compatible|url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible|website=Sean Carroll Blog|date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] is openly hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise and education involving science. According to Dawkins, religion "subverts science and saps the intellect".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Bantam Press, 2006, pp. 282–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that when science teachers attempt to expound on evolution, there is hostility aimed towards them by parents who are skeptical because they believe it conflicts with their own religious beliefs, and that even in some textbooks have had the word 'evolution' systematically removed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', Free Press, 2010, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked to argue the negative effects that he believes religion has on education of science.

====Criticism====

Others such as [[Francis Collins]], [[George F. R. Ellis]],
[[Kenneth R. Miller]], [[Katharine Hayhoe]], [[George Coyne]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] argue for compatibility since they do not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and to reflect on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts of Statements by Scientists Who See No Conflict Between Their Faith and Science|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/StatementsScience.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution|date=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-093049-3|pages=284–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Giberson argues that when discussing compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals are taken into account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Cynthia Tolman notes that religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, but when it comes to Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tolman|first1=Cynthia|title=Methods in Religion|url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|website=Malboro College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|archivedate=2015-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict thesis ====
{{Main|Conflict thesis}}
The [[conflict thesis]], which holds that religion and science have been in conflict continuously throughout history, was popularized in the 19th century by [[John William Draper]]'s and [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s accounts. It was in the 19th century that relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional complex interactions had been expressed before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most contemporary historians of science now reject the conflict thesis in its original form and no longer support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferngren, G.B.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=x|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=... while [John] Brooke's view [of a complexity thesis rather than an historical conflict thesis] has gained widespread acceptance among professional historians of science, the traditional view remains strong elsewhere, not least in the popular mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientists religion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

(p. 7, followed by a list of the basic reasons why the conflict thesis is wrong).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science, Gary Ferngren, has stated "Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization. If Galileo and the Scopes trial come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor).

Most historians today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (Galileo and Darwin) for a "complexity" model, because religious figures were on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved to discredit religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard H.|title=For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5566-8|pages=19–22, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited example of conflict, that has been clarified by historical research in the 20th century, was the Galileo affair, whereby interpretations of the Bible were used to attack ideas by [[Copernicus]] on [[heliocentrism]]. By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were "false" and "altogether contrary to Holy Scripture", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93).&lt;/ref&gt; However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual evidences that finally proved heliocentrism came centuries after Galileo: the stellar aberration of light by James Bradley in the 18th century, the orbital motions of binary stars by William Herschel in the 19th century,  the accurate measurement of the stellar parallax in the 19th century, and Newtonian mechanics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Biékowska|editor1-first=Barbara|title=Scientific World of Copernicus: On the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of his Birth 1473–1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9401026181|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Galileo have Proof of the Earth's Movement?|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/did_galileo.html|publisher=Tel-Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to physicist Christopher Graney, Galileo's own observations did not actually support the Copernican view, but were more consistent with Tycho Brahe's hybrid model where that Earth did not move and everything else circled around it and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson|first1=Katharine|title=Galileo backed Copernicus despite data: Stars viewed through early telescopes suggested that Earth stood still|journal=Nature|date=5 March 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.105|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100305/full/news.2010.105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]], still believes there is competition between science and religions and point to the origin of the universe, the nature of human beings and the possibility of miracles{{sfn|Grayling|2014|p=55|ps=:''"In fact religion and science are competitors for the truth about quite a number of things, including the origins of the universe, the nature of human beings, and the belief that the laws of nature can be locally and temporarily suspended- thus allowing for miracle"''}}

=== Independence ===

A modern view, described by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] as "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]" (NOMA), is that science and religion deal with fundamentally separate aspects of human experience and so, when each stays within its own domain, they co-exist peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]]. ''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T. Stace]] viewed independence from the perspective of the [[philosophy of religion]]. Stace felt that science and religion, when each is viewed in its own domain, are both consistent and complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. T. Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA's [[National Academy of Science]] supports the view that science and religion are independent.&lt;ref name="nas.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/Compatibility.html|title=Evolution Resources: Compatibility of Science and Religion |publisher=[[National Academies of the United States]]|work= [[Science, Evolution, and Creationism]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Science and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.&lt;ref name="nas.edu" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Positive science|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 87, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt;

==== Parallels in method ====
According to [[Ian Barbour]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] asserted that science is made up of [[paradigms]] that arise from cultural traditions, which is similar to the secular perspective on religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbour|first=Ian G.|authorlink=Ian Barbour|editor=Ian G. Barbour (ed.)|title=Science and Religion: New Perspectives on the Dialogue|edition=1st|year=1968|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location=New York, Evanston and London|pages=3–29|chapter=Science and Religion Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Polanyi]] asserted that it is merely a commitment to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] that protects against [[subjectivity]] and has nothing at all to do with personal detachment as found in many conceptions of the scientific method. Polanyi further asserted that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'".&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments similar to those found in religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt;

Two physicists, [[Charles A. Coulson]] and [[Harold K. Schilling]], both claimed that "the methods of science and religion have much in common."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Schilling asserted that both fields—science and religion—have "a threefold structure—of experience, theoretical interpretation, and practical application."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Coulson asserted that science, like religion, "advances by creative imagination" and not by "mere collecting of facts," while stating that religion should and does "involve critical reflection on experience not unlike that which goes on in science."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Religious language and scientific language also show parallels (cf. [[rhetoric of science]]).

Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] has argued that there is superficial conflict but deep concord between science and religion, and that there is deep conflict between science and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/religion-science/ Science and Religion], by Alvin Plantinga, 2007, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga, in his book ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism'', heavily contests the linkage of naturalism with science, as conceived by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and like-minded thinkers; while Daniel Dennett thinks that Plantinga stretches science to an unacceptable extent.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Philosopher sticks up for God|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/books/alvin-plantingas-new-book-on-god-and-science.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Maarten Boudry]], in reviewing the book, has commented that he resorts to [[creationism]] and fails to "stave off the conflict between theism and evolution."&lt;ref name=boudry&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maarten|last=Boudry|authorlink=Maarten Boudry|magazine=International History, Philosophy and Science Teaching Group|date=September 2012|title=Review of Alvin Plantinga (2011), Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism|quote=Plantinga's effort to stave off the conflict between theism and evolution is a failure... if the bar for rational belief is lowered to mere logical possibility, and the demand for positive evidence dropped, then no holds are barred.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientist [[Justin L.

=== Integration ===
As a general view, this holds that while interactions are complex between influences of science, theology, politics, social, and economic concerns, the productive engagements between science and religion throughout history should be duly stressed as the norm.

Scientific and theological perspectives often coexist peacefully. Christians and some non-Christian religions have historically integrated well with scientific ideas, as in the [[ancient Egypt]]ian technological mastery applied to [[monotheistic]] ends, the flourishing of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] under [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], and the scientific advances made by [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars during the [[Ottoman empire]]. Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.&lt;ref name="habgood" /&gt; According to [[Lawrence M. Principe]], the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Drew Professor of the Humanities, from a historical perspective this points out that much of the current-day clashes occur between limited extremists—both religious and scientistic fundamentalists—over a very few topics, and that the movement of ideas back and forth between scientific and theological thought has been more usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Religions have also given key participation in development of modern [[universities]] and libraries; centers of learning &amp; scholarship were coincident with religious institutions – whether pagan, Muslim, or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fundamental principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the harmony of religion and science.  [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] asserts that true [[science]] and true [[religion]] can never be in conflict. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, stated that religion without science is superstition and that science without religion is materialism. He also admonished that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hatcher | first = William | title = Science and the Bahá'í Faith | journal = [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–53 |date=September 1979 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.1979.tb00359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 306–07 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbs"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mehanian | first = Courosh |author2=Friberg, Stephen R.  | year = 2003 | title = Religion and Evolution Reconciled: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Comments on Evolution | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 55–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Buddhism and science}}
[[Buddhism]] and science have been regarded as compatible by numerous authors.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Amos. (2005) ''Buddhism and Science: Breaking New Ground (review)'' Buddhist-Christian Studies – Volume 25, 2005, pp. 176–80&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophic and psychological teachings found in Buddhism share points in common with [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|modern Western scientific and philosophic thought]]. For example, Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of nature (an activity referred to as ''[[Dhamma vicaya|Dhamma-Vicaya]]'' in the [[Pali Canon]])—the principal object of study being oneself.  Buddhism and science both show a strong emphasis on [[causality]]. However, Buddhism doesn't focus on [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan. (2003). ''Buddhism &amp; science: breaking new ground''. Columbia University Press, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], maintains that empirical scientific evidence supersedes the traditional teachings of [[Buddhism]] when the two are in conflict. In his book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' he wrote,  "My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science, so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation." and "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false," he says, "then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Jon.

Among early Christian teachers, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of [[Greek philosophy]], while [[Origen]] (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Edward B. | contribution = Christianity, History Of Science And Religion | year = 2003 | title = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion | editor-last = Van Huyssteen | editor-first = Wentzel | volume =  | pages = 123–27 | place = | publisher = Macmillan Reference  | isbn=978-0-02-865704-2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], [[beauty]] and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by [[God]], given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason), IV |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of today's scholars, such as [[Stanley Jaki]], have claimed that Christianity with its particular [[worldview]], was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Stanley L.

David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg reports that "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Peters, Ted. "Science and Religion". ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in the "Galileo's condemnation" story but through exaggerations, it has now become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ted Peters, Science and Religion, Encyclopedia of Religion, p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

A degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], "Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period "characterized by dramatic revolutions in science" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged. As science advanced, acceptance of a literal version of the Bible became "increasingly untenable" and some in that period presented ways of interpreting scripture according to its spirit on its authority and truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlightenement|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these "anti-monkey" laws were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Rights, Roger E.

Most scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested.

[[Theistic evolution]] attempts to reconcile Christian beliefs and science by accepting the scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the process of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as [[old earth creationism|evolutionary creationism]], which accepts some findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious teachings about God and creation in Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|title=The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-4274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconciliation in Britain in the early 20th century ===
In ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the [[Scopes Trial]]), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative Christians]]. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards [[neo-orthodox]] theology and the acceptance of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J.

In the 20th century, several [[ecumenical]] organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], [[Christians in Science]], [[Society of Ordained Scientists|The Society of Ordained Scientists]], and [[Veritas Forum|The Veritas Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

Across the Atlantic, the Society of Ordained Scientists and Christians in Science are similar affiliation in Great Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church and science}}

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981  [[John Paul II]], then [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of a biblical world view on early modern science ===
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 13th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
According to [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when [[Georg Calixtus]] ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that "the waters above the heavens" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White. ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (Kindle Locations 1970–2132)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the "handmaiden" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15–18|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell. ''Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians''. Praeger Paperback; New Edition (January 30, 1997). {{ISBN|0-275-95904-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-275-95904-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still very common in popular culture. Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science [[David C. Lindberg]] and [[Ronald L. Numbers]] write: "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference."&lt;ref name="flat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[David C.

[[H. Floris Cohen]] argued for a biblical Protestant, but not excluding Catholicism, influence on the early development of modern science.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wu8b2NAqnb0C ''The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry''], [[H. Floris Cohen]], University of Chicago Press 1994, 680 pages, {{ISBN|0-226-11280-2}}, pp. 308–21&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Dutch historian [[Reijer Hooykaas|R. Hooykaas]]' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and [[empiricism]], and a supreme God that left nature open to emulation and manipulation.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Finally, and most importantly, Hooykaas does not of course claim that the Scientific Revolution was exclusively the work of Protestant scholars."  Cohen (1994) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1994) p. 313. Hooykaas puts it more poetically: "Metaphorically speaking, whereas the bodily ingredients of science may have been Greek, its vitamins and hormones were biblical."&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford historian [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science.  Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science'' (Cambridge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2013}}  Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England.  For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'' (Cambridge, 2007); see also Charles Webster, ''The Great Instauration'' (London: Duckworth, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Historian and professor of religion [[Eugene Marion Klaaren|Eugene M. Klaaren]] holds that "a belief in divine creation" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael Foster]] has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs2edDIGCqEC|title=God and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century [[Anglican]] intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Jacob%20&amp;%20Jacob%20Anglican%20Fdn%20of%20Modern%20Science.htm The Anglican Origins of Modern Science], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]], Volume 71, Issue 2, June 1980, 251–67; this is also noted on p. 366 of ''Science and Religion'', [[John Hedley Brooke]], 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dillenberger]] and [[Christopher B.

Kaiser]], ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the "dependency thesis" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christianity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in the medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow;  he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary sources of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones" /&gt;

[[Oxford University]] historian and theologian [[John Hedley Brooke]] wrote that "when natural philosophers referred to ''laws'' of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the "laws that God has put into nature." Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the "counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}}, p. 19.  See also Peter Harrison, "Newtonian Science, Miracles, and the Laws of Nature", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 56 (1995), 531–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]] stated that this thesis "received a boost" from mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925). Numbers has also argued, "Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Christianity in pulpit and pew'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, [[Ronald L. Numbers]], pp. 4, 138 n. 3 where Numbers specifically raises his concerns with regards to the works of [[Michael B. Foster]], [[Reijer Hooykaas]], [[Eugene M. Klaaren]], and [[Stanley L. Jaki]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] of [[Baylor University]], argued in contrast that "Christian theology was essential for the rise of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], ''For the glory of God: how monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts and the end of slavery'', 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-11436-6}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a  positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), "Robert King Merton", in [[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], ''[[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]]''. Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0595-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century [[England]] and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory,  Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–60&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study [[God]]'s influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt;

== Confucianism and traditional Chinese religion ==
The historical process of Confucianism has largely been antipathic towards scientific discovery. However the religio-philosophical system itself is more neutral on the subject than such an analysis might suggest. In his writings On Heaven, [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] espoused a proto-scientific world view.&lt;ref&gt;Cua, Antonio S. "The Quasi-Empirical Aspect of Hsün-tzu's Philosophy of Human Nature." PEW 28 (1978), 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Han Synthesis the more anti-empirical [[Mencius]] was favored and combined with [[Daoist]] skepticism regarding the nature of reality. Likewise, during the Medieval period, [[Zhu Xi]] argued against technical investigation and specialization proposed by Chen Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman, Hoyt Cleveland.  "Utilitarian Confucianism : Chʻen Liang'' challenge to Chu Hsi" Cambridge, Mass.: Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University: Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; After contact with the West, scholars such as [[Wang Fuzhi]] would rely on Buddhist/Daoist skepticism to denounce all science as a subjective pursuit limited by humanity's fundamental ignorance of the true nature of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Alison Harley. "Man and Nature in the Philosophical Thought of Wang Fu-Chih." Publications on Asia of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, no. 41. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[May Fourth Movement]], attempts to modernize Confucianism and reconcile it with scientific understanding were attempted by many scholars including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Xiong Shili]]. Given the close relationship that Confucianism shares with Buddhism, many of the same arguments used to reconcile Buddhism with science also readily translate to Confucianism. However, modern scholars have also attempted to define the relationship between science and Confucianism on Confucianism's own terms and the results have usually led to the conclusion that Confucianism and science are fundamentally compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker "Confucianism and Ecology: The Interrelation of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (Religions of the World and Ecology)" Center for the Study of World Religions (August 15, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the dividing line between objective sciences and spiritual knowledge (''adhyatma vidya'') is a linguistic paradox.&lt;ref name="Mitcham"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|author=Carl Mitcham|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2005|page=917|isbn=0-02-865831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholastic activities and ancient Indian scientific advancements were so interconnected that many [[Hindu scriptures]] are also ancient scientific manuals and vice versa. In 1835, English was made the primary language for teaching in higher education in India, exposing Hindu scholars to Western secular ideas; this started [[Hindu Renaissance|a renaissance regarding religious and philosophical thought]].&lt;ref name="David Gosling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David L.|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: "Does What Goes Around Come Around?"|journal=Zygon|year=2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–69|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindu sages maintained that logical argument and rational proof using [[Nyaya]] is the way to obtain correct knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mitcham" /&gt; The scientific level of understanding focuses on how things work and from where they originate, while Hinduism strives to understand the ultimate purposes for the existence of living things.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt; To obtain and broaden the knowledge of the world for spiritual perfection, many refer to the Bhāgavata for guidance because it draws upon a scientific and theological dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|pages=576–77|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=664a012b-631b-40dc-8433-ab92d3cc478f%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4204|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinduism offers methods to correct and transform itself in course of time. For instance, Hindu views on the development of life include a range of viewpoints in regards to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. For instance, it has been suggested that Wallace-Darwininan evolutionary thought was a part of Hindu thought centuries before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Volume 3)|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=688|quote=The Hindus were Spinozaites more than two thousand years before the existence of Spinoza; and Darwinians many centuries before our time, and before any word like 'evolution' existed in any language of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shankara and the Sāmkhya did not have a problem with the theory of evolution, but instead, argued about the existence of God and what happened after death. These two distinct groups argued among each other's philosophies because of their sacred texts, not the idea of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', many Hindus were eager to connect their scriptures to Darwinism, finding similarities between Brahma's creation, Vishnu's incarnations, and evolution theories.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt;

[[Samkhya]], the oldest school of [[Hindu philosophy]] prescribes a particular method to analyze knowledge. According to Samkhya, all knowledge is possible through three means of valid knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Sarma, Deepak (2011) "''Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader''" p. 167 Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Samkhya Karika'', ''śloka''4&lt;/ref&gt; –
# ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' – direct sense perception,
# ''Anumāna'' – [[logic]]al [[inference]] and
# ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' – verbal testimony.

[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, accepts all these 3 means and in addition accepts one more – ''[[Upamāna]]'' (comparison).

The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary in description, but classically the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe' with the other two deities being responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/beliefs/intro_1.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics-Hinduism|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural [[Creation myth#Hindu|creation myth]] literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution. Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

In a survey of 909 people, 77% of respondents in India agreed with [[Darwinism|Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution]], and 85 per cent of God-believing people said they believe in evolution as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885 |title=Opinions on evolution from ten countries |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2100585.ece | title = One in seven Britons believe in creationism over evolution | location=London | work=The Times | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per [[Vedas]], another explanation for the creation is based on the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]]: earth, water, fire, air and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].
The Hindu religion traces its beginnings to the sacred Vedas. Everything that is established in the Hindu faith such as the gods and goddesses, doctrines, chants, spiritual insights, etc. flow from the poetry of [[Vedic hymns]]. The Vedas offer an honor to the sun and moon, water and wind, and to the order in Nature that is universal. This naturalism is the beginning of what further becomes the connection between Hinduism and science.&lt;ref name=Raman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raman|first=Varadaraja|title=Hinduism and science : some reflections|journal=[[ATLA Religion Database]] with [[ATLASerials]]|year=2012|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=809d5e47-2422-42bc-85ef-7701d6206834@sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=6&amp;resultId=12&amp;theDisplayFormat=CitationAndFullText&amp;ReturnUrl=%252fehost%252fresults%252fresultlist%253fsid%253d809d5e47-2422-42bc-85ef-7701d6206834%2540sessionmgr4001%2526vid%253d6%2526resultId%253d_resultId_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islam and science}}
{{See also|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}

From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of [[nature]], is considered to be linked to the concept of ''Tawhid'' (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007"&gt;Muzaffar Iqbal (2007). Science &amp; Islam. Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;2. Toshihiko Izutsu (1964). God and Man in the Koran. Weltansckauung. Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; It was with this understanding that science was studied and understood in Islamic civilizations, specifically during the eighth to sixteenth centuries, prior to the colonization of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Situating Arabic Science: Locality versus Essence (A.I. Sabra)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Briffault (1928).

With the decline of Islamic Civilizations in the late Middle Ages and the rise of Europe, the Islamic scientific tradition shifted into a new period. Institutions that had existed for centuries in the Muslim world looked to the new scientific institutions of European powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This changed the practice of science in the Muslim world, as Islamic scientists had to confront the western approach to scientific learning, which was based on a different philosophy of nature.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt; From the time of this initial upheaval of the Islamic scientific tradition to the present day, Muslim scientists and scholars have developed a spectrum of viewpoints on the place of scientific learning within the context of Islam, none of which are universally accepted or practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seyyid Hossein Nasr. "Islam and Modern Science"&lt;/ref&gt; However, most maintain the view that the acquisition of knowledge and scientific pursuit in general is not in disaccord with Islamic thought and religious belief.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Ahmadiyya ===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement emphasize that "there is no contradiction between [[Islam and science]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Ahmadi Muslims universally accept in principle the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promote it. Over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution, and frequently engages in promoting how religious scriptures, such as the Qur'an, supports the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title=Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

The Quran has never advised against studying science, lest the reader should become a non-believer; because it has no such fear or concern.

== Jainism ==
{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a [[creator deity]]. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents – soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

== Perspectives from the scientific community ==

=== History ===
{{Further|List of Jewish scientists and philosophers|List of Christian thinkers in science|List of Muslim scientists|List of atheists (science and technology)|}}
In the 17th century, founders of the [[Royal Society]] largely held conventional and orthodox religious views, and a number of them were prominent Churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, 'Religion, the Royal Society, and the Rise of Science', ''Theology and Science'', 6 (2008), 255–71.&lt;/ref&gt;  While theological issues that had the potential to be divisive were typically excluded from formal discussions of the early Society, many of its fellows nonetheless believed that their scientific activities provided support for traditional religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sprat, ''The History of the Royal Society'' (London, 1667)&lt;/ref&gt;  Clerical involvement in the Royal Society remained high until the mid-nineteenth century, when science became more professionalised.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Turner, 'The Victorian Conflict between Science and Religion: A Professional Dimension', ''Isis'', 49 (1978) 356–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] supported the compatibility of some interpretations of religion with science. In "Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium" published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York in 1941, Einstein stated:
{{quotation|Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself. In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts. According to this interpretation the well-known conflicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm |title=Albert Einstein:Religion and Science |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Einstein thus expresses views of [[ethical non-naturalism]] (contrasted to [[ethical naturalism]]).

Prominent modern scientists who are [[Atheism|atheists]] include evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and Nobel Prize–winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]]. Prominent scientists advocating religious belief include Nobel Prize–winning physicist and [[United Church of Christ]] member [[Charles Townes]], evangelical Christian and past head of the [[Human Genome Project]] [[Francis Collins]], and climatologist [[John T. Houghton]].&lt;ref name=east1997 /&gt;

In 1916, 1,000 leading American scientists were randomly chosen from ''American Men of Science'' and 42% believed God existed, 42% disbelieved, and 17% had doubts/did not know; however when the study was replicated 80 years later using ''American Men and Women of Science'' in 1996, results were very much the same with 39% believing God exists, 45% disbelieved, and 15% had doubts/did not know.&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

In total, in terms of belief toward a personal god and personal immortality, about 60% of [[United States]] scientists in these fields expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and about 40% expressed belief.&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

A survey conducted between 2005 and 2007 by [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]] of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] of 1,646 natural and social science professors at 21 US research universities found that, in terms of belief in God or a higher power, more than 60% expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and more than 30% expressed belief. More specifically, nearly 34% answered "I do not believe in God" and about 30% answered "I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out."&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine|title=Religion and Spirituality among University Scientists|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Ecklund.pdf|publisher=Social Science Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, 28% said they believed in God and 8% believed in a higher power that was not God.&lt;ref name="Ecklund scientists study"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|title=Science vs. Religion : What Scientists Really Think|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-539298-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund stated that scientists were often able to consider themselves spiritual without religion or belief in god.&lt;ref name=physorgeck&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf5785.pdf|publisher=Physorg.com|title=Natural scientists are less likely to believe in God than are social scientists}} "Many scientists see themselves as having a spirituality not attached to a particular religious tradition.

Many studies have been conducted in the [[United States]] and have generally found that scientists are less likely to believe in God than are the rest of the population. Precise definitions and statistics vary, with some studies concluding that about {{frac|1|3}} of scientists in the U.S. are atheists, {{frac|1|3}} agnostic, and {{frac|1|3}} have some belief in God (although some might be [[deistic]], for example).&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

In terms of perceptions, most social and natural scientists from 21 American universities did not perceive conflict between science and religion, while 37% did.

A 2009 report by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that members of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) were "much less religious than the general public," with 51% believing in some form of deity or higher power.

According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48% say they have a religious affiliation, equal to the number who say they are not affiliated with any religious tradition. 17% were atheists, 11% were agnostics, 20% were nothing in particular, 8% were Jewish, 10% were Catholic, 16% were Protestant, 4% were Evangelical, 10% were other religion. The survey also found younger scientists to be "substantially more likely than their older counterparts to say they believe in God". Among the surveyed fields, chemists were the most likely to say they believe in God.&lt;ref name="people-press.org" /&gt;

Elaine Ecklund conducted a study from 2011 to 2014 involving the general US population, including rank and file scientists, in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). The study noted that 76% of the scientists identified with a religious tradition. 85% of evangelical scientists had no doubts about the existence of God, compared to 35% of the whole scientific population. In terms of religion and science, 85% of evangelical scientists saw no conflict (73% collaboration, 12% independence), while 75% of the whole scientific population saw no conflict (40% collaboration, 35% independence).&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS" /&gt;

Religious beliefs of US professors were examined using a nationally representative sample of more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% did not believe in God, 16% did not know if God existed, 43% believed God existed, and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not believe in God, 33% did not know if God existed, 44% believed God existed, and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% believe in God some of the time, 17% had doubts but believed in God, 35% believed in God and had no doubts.&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

Farr Curlin, a [[University of Chicago]] Instructor in Medicine and a member of the [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]], noted in a study that doctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a study that "found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent believe in some sort of afterlife." Furthermore, "90 percent of doctors in the United States attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to 81 percent of all adults." He reasoned, "The responsibility to care for those who are suffering and the rewards of helping those in need resonate throughout most religious traditions."&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu" /&gt;

Physicians in the United States, by contrast, are much more religious than scientists, with 76% stating a belief in God.&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu"&gt;Easton, John.

Over time, scientists and historians have moved away from the conflict thesis and toward compatibility theses (either the integration thesis or non-overlapping magisteria). Many experts have now adopted a "complexity thesis" that combines several other models,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2011).

Global studies which have pooled data on religion and science from 1981–2001, have noted that countries with high religiosity also have stronger faith in science, while less religious countries have more skepticism of the impact of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=67–68|quote=Instead, as is clearly shown in Figure 3.3, societies with greater faith in science also often have ''stronger'' religious beliefs." and "Indeed, the secular postindustrial societies, exemplified by the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, prove most skeptical toward the impact of science and technology, and this is in accordance with the countries where the strongest public disquiet has been expressed about certain contemporary scientific developments such as the use of genetically modified organisms, biotechnological cloning, and nuclear power. Interestingly, again the United States displays distinctive attitudes compared with similar European nations, showing greater faith in both God and scientific progress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is noted there as distinctive because of greater faith in both God and scientific progress. Other research cites the [[National Science Foundation]]'s finding that America has more favorable public attitudes towards science than Europe, Russia, and Japan despite differences in levels of religiosity in these cultures.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of Science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-87369-7|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |pages=336, 345–47|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists. Even people who accept a strict creationist view, regarding the origins of life are mostly favorable towards science." ; "Our review of three important issues on the public policy agenda in the United States suggest that although there is a potential for broad religiously based conflict over science, the scope of this conflict is limited. Only on one issue does a significant portion of the public deny strong consensus for religious reasons: evolution. The significance of this disagreement should not be understated, but it is decidedly unrepresentative of the broader set of scientific controversies and issues. As already noted, it is difficult to find any other major policy issues on which there are strong religious objections to scientific research. Religious concerns do arise in connection with a number of areas of life sciences research, such as the effort to develop medical therapies from embryonic stem cells. But these are not rooted in disputes about the truth of scientific research, and can be found across the spectrum of religious sentiment." ; "According to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes about science are more favorable in the United States than in Europe, Russia, and Japan, despite great differences across these cultures in level of religiosity (National Science Foundation, 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on people from Sweden concludes that though the Swedes are among the most non-religious, paranormal beliefs are prevalent among both the young and adult populations.

Concerning specific topics like creationism, it is not an exclusively American phenomenon. A poll on adult Europeans revealed that 40% believed in naturalistic evolution, 21% in theistic evolution, 20% in special creation, and 19% are undecided; with the highest concentrations of young earth creationists in Switzerland (21%), Austria (20%), Germany (18%).&lt;ref name="Numbers Internat.

According to a 2015 Pew Research Center Study on the public perceptions on science, people's perceptions on conflict with science have more to do with their perceptions of other people's beliefs than their own personal beliefs. For instance, the majority of people with a religious affiliation (68%) saw no conflict between their own personal religious beliefs and science while the majority of those without a religious affiliation (76%) perceived science and religion to be in conflict.&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Alper|first2=Becka|title=Religion and Science: Highly Religious Americans are less likely than others to see Conflict between Faith and Science.|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/22/science-and-religion/|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that people who are not affiliated with any religion, also known as "religiously unaffiliated", often have supernatural beliefs and spiritual practices despite them not being affiliated with any religion&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that "just one-in-six religiously unaffiliated adults (16%) say their own religious beliefs conflict with science."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt; Furthermore, the study observed, "The share of all adults who perceive a conflict between science and their own religious beliefs has declined somewhat in recent years, from 36% in 2009 to 30% in 2014.

The 2013 MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins examined the views of religious people in America on origins science topics like evolution, the Big Bang, and perceptions of conflicts between science and religion. It found that a large majority of religious people see no conflict between science and religion and only 11% of religious people belong to religions openly rejecting evolution. The fact that the gap between personal and official beliefs of their religions is so large suggests that part of the problem, might be defused by people learning more about their own religious doctrine and the science it endorses, thereby bridging this belief gap. The study concluded that "mainstream religion and mainstream science are neither attacking one another nor perceiving a conflict." Furthermore, they note that this conciliatory view is shared by most leading science organizations such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).&lt;ref name="MIT Science religion origins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|last2=Lee|first2=Eugena|title=The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lines of research on perceptions of science among the American public conclude that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science and they have no differences with nonreligious groups in the propensity of seeking out scientific knowledge, although there may be subtle epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–27|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–53|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from the Pew Center note similar findings and also note that the majority of Americans (80–90%) show strong support for scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter|author2=Gregory Smith|author3=David Masci|pages=1–2, 13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619225841/http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;

According to a 2007 poll by the [[Pew Forum]], "while large majorities of Americans respect science and scientists, they are not always willing to accept scientific findings that squarely contradict their religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=pew2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=275|title=Science in America: Religious Belief and Public Attitudes|publisher=The Pew Forum|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Forum states that specific factual disagreements are "not common today", though 40% to 50% of Americans do not accept the evolution of humans and other living things, with the "strongest opposition" coming from evangelical Christians at 65% saying life did not evolve.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; 51% of the population believes humans and other living things evolved: 26% through natural selection only, 21% somehow guided, 4% don't know.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In the U.S., biological evolution is the only concrete example of conflict where a significant portion of the American public denies scientific consensus for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In terms of advanced industrialized nations, the United States is the most religious.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt;

A 2009 study from the Pew Research Center on Americans perceptions of science, showed a broad consensus that most Americans, including most religious Americans, hold scientific research and scientists themselves in high regard. The study showed that 84% of Americans say they view science as having a mostly positive impact on society. Among those who attend religious services at least once a week, the number is roughly the same at 80%. Furthermore, 70% of U.S. adults think scientists contribute "a lot" to society.&lt;ref name="pew 2009 bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion on Religion and Science in the United States|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/public-opinion-on-religion-and-science-in-the-united-states/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study on a national sample of US college students examined whether these students viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than towards a conflict view.&lt;ref name=scheitle11&gt;{{cite journal

'''Religious satire''' is a form of [[satire]] targeted at [[religious]] [[belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"/&gt; From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with [[politics]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PA116 pp.116-8] quotation: {{quotation|...religion, politics, and sexuality are the primary stuff of literary satire. Among these sacret targets, matters costive and defecatory play an important part. ... from the earliest times, satirists have utilized scatological and bathroom humor. Aristophanes, always livid and nearly scandalous in his religious, political, and sexual references...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1973) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5NZAAAAMAAJ ''Satire--that blasted art''] p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnwhAQAAIAAJ ''Menippeans &amp; Their Satire: Concerning Monstrous Leamed Old Dogs and Hippocentaurs''], in Scholia satyrica, Volume 6, 3/4, 1980 p.45 quotation: {{quotation|[Chapple's book ''Soviet satire of the twenties'']...classifying the very ''topics'' his satirists satirized: housing, food, and fuel supplies, poverty, inflation, "hooliganism", public services, religion, stereotypes of nationals (the Englishman, German, &amp;c), &amp;c. Yet the truth of the matter is that no satirist worth his salt (Petronius, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift, Leskov, Grass) ever avoids man's habits and living standards, or scants those delicate desiderata: religion, politics, and sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire. Religious satire can be the result of [[agnosticism]] or [[atheism]]. Religious satire surfaced during the [[Renaissance]], with works by Chaucer, Erasmus and Durer.

* The [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]] is a [[goddess]] which takes the form of a [[unicorn]] that is [[paradox]]ically both invisible ''and'' pink.

* [[Discordianism]] is centered around the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] goddess of chaos, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], but draws much of its tone from [[Zen Buddhism]], Christianity, and the [[beatnik]] and [[hippie]] [[counterculture]]s of the 1950s and 1960s (respectively). Its main holy book, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' contains things such as a commandment to "not believe anything that you read," and a claim that all statements are both true and false at the same time.
* The [[Church of the SubGenius]] pokes fun at many different religions, particularly [[Scientology]], [[Televangelism]] (and its associated scandals), and other modern beliefs.

* [[Purim Torah]], traditional parodies of Jewish life written out, and/or acted out, for the holiday of [[Purim]].

==Reactions, criticism and censorship==

Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not 
be subject to ridicule.  In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Molière's play ''[[Tartuffe]]'' was banned in 1664.

The film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/7530542.stm Vicar supports Life of Brian ban]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dyke, C: ''Screening Scripture'', pp. 238-240. Trinity Press International, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters.  According to the [[Monty Python|Pythons]], ''Life of Brian'' is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Secret Life of Brian |year= 2007 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDCAJTrF1gg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[freedom of speech]] was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the [[Religious Hatred Bill]] in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the [[House of Lords]] making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Votes on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill | year = 2006 | url = http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/search.php?query=racial+and+religious+hatred+bill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Church of the SubGenius#Legal matters|Rachel Bevilacqua]], a member of the [[Church of the SubGenius]], known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's [[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]] festival.

[[Richard Dawkins]] frequently points out that there is no reason to exclude religion from objective studying like any other social phenomena.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The '''Royal Navy Chaplaincy Service''' provides [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] to the [[Royal Navy]]. The chaplains are commissioned by the Sovereign but do not hold military rank other than that of "Chaplain Royal Navy". They are usually addressed as Padre, Reverend or more informally Bish. Chaplains are recruited from a number of [[Christian denominations]].

The senior chaplain in the Royal Navy is currently [[Martyn Gough (chaplain)|Martyn Gough]]. An Anglican priest, he is also the Archdeacon for the Royal Navy.

==Training==
Chaplains undergo training at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] alongside other [[Royal Navy]] officer cadets. After completing the course they may opt to earn their "Dolphins" and serve in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] or the [[green beret]] (upon completion of the [[All Arms Commando Course]]) and serve with the [[Royal Marines]].

==Chaplains of the Fleet==

[[Halakha]] ([[Jewish]] law) addresses three main topics applicable to [[tobacco]] and [[cigarette]] [[smoking]] from the [[early modern period]] to the present day: the regulation of smoking on days of special Jewish significance, the debate over [[Smoking ban|prohibition of smoking]], per se, with regard to individual Jews, and the general environmental concerns (e.g. [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoking]]).

{{Judaism}}

==Historical background==
Until the late 20th century, the use of tobacco for smoking and in the form of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] was common among Jews. It is asserted that a Jew named [[Luis de Torres]], who accompanied [[Christopher Columbus]] on his expedition in 1492, settled in [[Cuba]], learned the use of tobacco, and introduced it into Europe. From this time Jews were connected with the trade in tobacco, one of the most important in early American history (M. J. Kohler, in ''Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc.'' x. 52)&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

===Ritual and other moral concerns===
Recently, some rabbis considered smoking an improper, lightheaded activity for [[students]] (Stone 302).

Rabbis also debated the use of tobacco under traditional Jewish law, including varying aspects of its permissibility on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[chagim]] (Jewish [[holy]] days), [[fasting|fast]]-days, and whether a special "smoking" [[berakhah]] ([[blessing]]) might be needed. Among the early sources are the ''Keneset ha-Gedolah'' ("Men of the Great Assembly") of Rabbi Hayyim Benveniste (1603–73) and the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh#Major commentaries|Magen Avraham]]'' ("Shield of Abraham") of [[Avraham Gombiner]] (1635–83). Gombiner referred to the "drinking of ''tabak'' [tobacco] through a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] by drawing the smoke into the mouth and discharging it," and said that a smoker should first make a [[blessing]] over smoking as a type of refreshment. Believing that tobacco was soaked in [[beer]] — a source of ''[[chametz]]'', or [[leaven]] — he [[ban (law)|ban]]ned smoking during [[Passover]]. (ib. 343). Benveniste expressed himself very forcibly against smoking ''tutun'' (tobacco) on the [[Ninth of Av]], and reportedly [[excommunicate]]d a Jew who smoked on that solemn fast-day (''Keneset ha-Gedolah'', to Orach Chayim, 551, 21). Benveniste “points out the inconsistency of those authorities who permit smoking on holy days because it is a 'necessity,' a 'means of sustaining life,' and who allow it on fast-days because smoke has no 'substance' like [[food]].&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt; In Benveniste's opinion, smoking was prohibited on holy days; he quoted Rabbi [[Joseph Escapa]] as coinciding in this view, though he thought it unwise to enforce a generally accepted law.”&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Writing in [[Turkey]], an [[Islamic]] country, Benveniste further argued that smoking is ''[[Chillul Hashem]]'' (a defamation of [[God]]), because [[Muslim]]s refraining from smoking on fast-days would see Jews smoking on theirs (''Keneset ha-Gedolah'', ib. 567 [ed. Constantinople, 1729, pp.&amp;nbsp;101 ''et seq''.]). Despite such concerns, some Jews did smoke on the Sabbath, and visited Muslim neighbors in order to smoke [[hooka]]s there. [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] authorities banned this practise on the grounds that [[Gentile]]s would consider [[Judaism]] as ridiculous (Alkalai, "Zekor le-Abraham," i. 142-143, Salonica, 1798).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838–1933), known as the ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]'' ("Desirer of Life"), also sought to dissuade practitioners from smoking.  He considered it a waste of time, and saw the practice of people borrowing cigarettes from each other as morally questionable. (Cp. Stone (296f., 299) and [[Eliezer Waldenberg]]).

There is a custom still practiced today by Hasidic and some Haredi grooms who hand out free cigarettes to their friends at their ''[[vort]]'' (engagement). Recent rulings against smoking by great rabbis do not have seem to have stopped the tradition.{{fact|date=March 2013}}  Early on in the Hasidic movement, the [[Baal Shem Tov]] taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era.  Rabbi [[Levi Yitchak of Berditchev]] is quoted as saying that "a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath".  Rabbi [[Dovid of Lelov]] taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of [[Lelov (Hasidic dynasty)|Lelov]] and [[Skulen (Hasidic dynasty)|Skulen]], however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after [[Havdalah]].  Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of [[Purim]], even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple.  However, many Hasidic Rabbis oppose smoking.

===Specific aspects of smoking===
Early modern [[Jewish law]] also addresses the Turkish ''[[hookah|narghile]]'', or [[water pipe]], which filters the smoke through water. Benveniste rules that the ''narghile'' violates even holy-day regulations because it may extinguish fire (which is not permitted to be extinguished on a Jewish holy day). Gombiner forbids the ''naghile's'' use because its tobacco is analogous to the ''mugmar'' (spice incense) banned by [[Talmudic law]]. &lt;ref name=jesmoking&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14416-tobacco Jewish Encyclopedia: Tobacco]. 1906. Retrieved 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike smoking, the use of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] was allowed on the Sabbath, holy days, fast-days, and [[Yom Kippur]] (''Leket ha-Kemah'', p.&amp;nbsp;51b, Amsterdam, 1707).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt; Jacob Haziz (1620-74) quotes a [[responsum]] of Isaiah Pinto permitting the use of snuff on the Sabbath, even though it cures [[catarrh]]; for everybody, even healthy people, snuff, and it can not therefore be considered a drug ("Halakot Ketannot," No. 101).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Some Jewish women also used tobacco (see Elijah of Lublin, ''Yad Eliyahu'', responsum No. 65, Amsterdam, 1712).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

The Jewish Encyclopedia also cites [[Hebrew]] [[poetry]] on tobacco: “Solomon Wilder of Amsterdam composed one in acceptance of a tobacco-pipe as a [[birthday]] [[gift|present]] (''Ha-Karmel'', 1862, vol. ii., No. 20). Another poem characterizes the cigar and cigarette as "the two tails of these smoking firebrands" (Isa. vii. 4; see "Ha-Boker Or," i. 123).”&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

==''Halachic'' controversy==
There has been extensive controversy regarding the question of smoking. The debate about the acceptability of smoking according to ''halacha'' is centered primarily around the prohibition for a person to damage his body, or bring about his death. Opponents of smoking argue that since there is a clear link between smoking and cancer, smoking should be prohibited. However, Rabbi [[Moses Feinstein]] wrote a responsum stating that while inadvisable, smoking was permitted for one who had already started. Feinstein explained that since the risk of illness or death due to smoking is considered small, and it is a widespread practice, it is therefore permitted under the rabbinical principle:  "[[The Lord protects the simple]]." However, starting to smoke would be prohibited because of the transgression of [[v'lo sasuru]].&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2;76&lt;/ref&gt; According to students, when informed of the dangers of smoking, Rabbi [[Aaron Kotler]] ruled that smoking was a biblical transgression.&lt;ref&gt;letter from his close student Rabbi Yechiel Perr, the current Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva of Far Rockaway available at {{cite web |url=http://haviv.org/daat/?file=kop2.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614164104/http://www.haviv.org/daat/?file=kop2.php |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Haredi]] rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit'. These rabbis include Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]], Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Shapiro]], Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]]. Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner|Shmuel HaLevi Wosner]] forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke are obligated to do everything they can to stop. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132739/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704223348/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131007/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi [[Ben Tzion Abba Shaul]] and Rabbi [[Moshe Tzedaka]] called on youth not to start smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195654/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], Rabbi [[Moshe Stern]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg]].

Smoking is specifically prohibited by [[Solomon Freehof]], other [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis, as well as rabbis in the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement in the U.S. and Israel. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Second-hand smoke===
The early modern [[responsa]] literature shows that Jewish students smoked in their ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]'' – or study halls – and [[synagogue]]s. Some rabbis sought to outlaw smoking and the use of snuff in [[place of worship|places of worship]] (''Pahad Yitzkhak'', 9, p.&amp;nbsp;62a) and posted notices for study halls. (''Ha-Maggid'', 1859, vol. iii., No. 16). While smoking had been extremely prevalent in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] ''[[yeshivot]]'', rabbinic opinions have led to a major decrease in cigarette use in Israeli and (especially) [[United States|America]]n ''yeshivot''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In tandem with [[secular]] campaigns to restrict indoor tobacco-smoking as harmful to non-smokers, Orthodox [[posek|rabbinical authorities]] began to make it virtually prohibited [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] to smoke in synagogues and study halls. Rabbi [[Moses Feinstein]] ruled against indoor smoking based on ''halakha'' covering nuisance and [[pollution]], while most other rabbis have based a similar ruling on the halakha concerning health.  In Israel, Jewish doctors and rabbis work collaboratively on anti-smoking efforts. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

On June 30, 2006, the ''[[Vaad]] Halacha'' (Jewish law committee), sponsored by the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], ruled that the use of tobacco is forbidden to Jews, and the committee specifically cited and reversed precedents that permitted smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/Prohibition_Smoking_Full_Translation.pdf |title=The Prohibition of Smoking in Halacha |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Matheson Trust was established in London in 1974 by [[Donald Macleod Matheson]] [[CBE]] (1896-1979),&lt;ref&gt;Settlement recorded in the archives of the London Borough of [[Bromley]], 12 January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to his work as a civil servant&lt;ref&gt;Matheson was appointed CBE in 1945, after serving for years as the Secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]: [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37119/supplements/2953/page.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; was active as a translator of [[Traditionalist School|Perennialist]] works, most notably ''Understanding Islam'' by [[Frithjof Schuon]]&lt;ref&gt;George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' by [[Titus Burckhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Donald-McLeod-Matheson.aspx |title=Sh.

As of October 2018, there are more than 600 holdings in the library, a quarter of which are audio recordings.

=== Audio Library ===

One of the purported aims of the Matheson Library is to use existing contemporary media technologies to make available resources from ancient traditions, either in the form of recitation of traditional scriptures or in the scholarly transmission of the doctrines and insights pertaining to the different religions. An ongoing ''hear!'' project is converting scholarly texts and other texts of interest into [[MP3]] format, and making them available through the Audio section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themathesontrust.org/type/audio/ |title=Audio |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the ''Matheson Trust Sacred Audio Collection'' was launched, a repository of selected liturgical audio recordings from the major religious traditions. This collection includes live recordings from temples and ritual gatherings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/sacred-audio-collection |title=Sacred Audio Collection |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huxley Perennial Philosophy coverblurb1946 Low Res.jpg|thumb|Publisher's jacket blurb for the first United Kingdom edition]]

'''''The Perennial Philosophy''''' is a comparative study of mysticism by the British writer and novelist [[Aldous Huxley]]. Its title derives from the theological tradition of the ''[[philosophia perennis]]''.

==Social and political context==

''The Perennial Philosophy'' was first published in 1945 immediately after the [[Second World War]] (and the defeat of [[National Socialism]]) by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in the United States (1946 by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in the United Kingdom). The jacket text of the British first edition explains:&lt;ref name="Cover"&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Aldous | authorlink=Aldous Huxley | title=The Perennial Philosophy | edition=1st. | year=1946 | publisher=Chatto and Windus | location= London | page=Dust Jacket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is an attempt to present this Highest Common Factor of all theologies by assembling passages from the writings of those saints and prophets who have approached a direct spiritual knowledge of the Divine...&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The book offers readers, who are assumed to be familiar with the Christian religion and the Bible, a fresh approach employing Eastern and Western [[mysticism]]:
{{quote|Mr. Huxley quotes from the Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophers, from followers of [[Buddha]] and [[Muhammad|Mohammed]], from the [[Brahmin]] scriptures and from Christian mystics ranging from [[John of the Cross|St John of the Cross]] to [[William Law]], giving preference to those whose writings, often illuminated by genius, are unfamiliar to the modern reader.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

The final paragraph of the jacket text states:

{{quote|In this profoundly important work, Mr. Huxley has made no attempt to 'found a new religion'; but in analyzing the Natural Theology of the Saints, as he has described it, he provides us with an absolute standard of faith by which we can judge both our moral depravity as individuals and the insane and often criminal behaviour of the national societies we have created.&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;}}

==Scope of the book==

In the words of poet and anthologist [[John Robert Colombo]]:

{{quote|''The Perennial Philosophy'' is essentially an anthology of short passages taken from traditional Eastern texts and the writings of Western mystics, organised by subject and topic, with short connecting commentaries. No specific sources are given. Paging through the index gives the reader (or non-reader) an idea of who and what Huxley has taken seriously. Here are the entries in the index that warrant two lines of page references or more:&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gurdjieffbooks.wordpress.com/category/the-perennial-philosophy-revisited/ | title=books, news, reviews | publisher=Gurdjieff Books Wordpress | work='THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY' revisited | date=16 June 2010 | accessdate=25 October 2011 | author=Colombo, John Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Aquinas, Augustine, St. Bernard, Bhagavad-Gita, Buddha, Jean Pierre Camus, St. Catherine, Christ, Chuang Tzu, "Cloud of Unknowing,” Contemplation, Deliverance, Desire, Eckhart (five lines, the most quoted person), Eternity, Fénelon, François de Sales, Godhead, Humility, Idolatry, St. John of the Cross, Knowledge, Lankavatara Sutra, William Law (another four lines), Logos, Love, Mahayana, Mind, Mortification, Nirvana, Perennial Philosophy (six lines, a total of 40 entries in all), Prayer, Rumi, Ruysbroeck, Self, Shankara, Soul, Spirit, "Theologia Germanica," Truth, Upanishads (six different ones are quoted), Will, Words.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Style of the book==

Huxley deliberately chose less well-known quotations because "familiarity with traditionally hallowed writings tends to breed, not indeed contempt, but ... a kind of reverential insensibility, ... an inward deafness to the meaning of the sacred words."&lt;ref&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, Chapter 5 on "Charity" takes just one quotation from the Bible, combining it with less familiar sources:

:"He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''1 John iv''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"By love may He be gotten and holden, but by thought never."&lt;sub&gt;''The Cloud of Unknowing''&lt;/sub&gt;

:"The astrolabe of the mysteries of God is love."&lt;sub&gt;''Jalal-uddin Rumi''&lt;/sub&gt;"&lt;ref name=PP95&gt;''The Perennial Philosophy'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley then explains: "We can only love what we know, and we can never know completely what we do not love. Love is a mode of knowledge ..."&lt;ref name=PP95/&gt;

Huxley is quite vague with his references: "No specific sources are given."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt;

==Structure of the book==

The book's structure consists of:

* A brief Introduction by Huxley, of just over 5 pages.
* Twenty-seven chapters (each of about 10 pages) of quotations from sages and saints on specific topics, with "short connecting commentaries."&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff /&gt; The chapters are not grouped in any way though there is a kind of order from the nature of the ''Ground'' at the beginning, down to practical exercises at the end. The Acknowledgements list 27 books from which quotations have been taken. The chapter titles are:

*''Book Week'' (21 October 1945).
*''Booklist'' v. 42 (15 November 1945).
*''The Christian Century'' v. 62 (12 December 1945).
*Bull VA Kirkus' Bookshop Serv v. 13 (1 August 1945). 
*''The Nation'' v. 161 (27 October 1945).
*''The New Republic'' v. 113 (5 November 1945).

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Perhaps Mr. Huxley, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'' has, at this time, written the most needed book in the world."&lt;ref name=nyt1945&gt;{{cite news | author=Toksvig, Signe |title= Aldous Huxley's prescriptions for spiritual myopia| newspaper=New York Times |date= 30 September 1945 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' described the book as an:

{{quote|... anthology [that] is above all a masterpiece of discrimination.... [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] gave the name of the [[Perennial philosophy|Perennial Philosophy]] to this theme. Mr. Huxley has systematised, and dealt with, its many-branching problems, perils and [[beatitudes]].&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;}}

The ''Times'' also stated that, "It is important to say that even an agnostic, even a behaviorist-materialist ... can read this book with joy. It is the masterpiece of all anthologies."&lt;ref name=nyt1945/&gt;

Similarly, forty years later [[Huston Smith]], a religious scholar, wrote that, in ''The Perennial Philosophy'':

{{quote|Huxley provides us with the most systematic statement of his mature outlook. Its running commentary deals with many of the social implications of Huxley's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous (1993) ''Huxley on God'', Introduction – Walter Houston Smith p. 9, HarperSanFrancisco {{ISBN|0-06-250536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all the reception was so positive. Chad Walsh, writing in the ''Journal of Bible and Religion''&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh&gt;{{Cite journal| jstor=3693645 | title=Journal of Bible and Religion | publisher=Journal of Bible and Religion. Vol 16, No 1. pp 3–12 | work=Pilgrimage to the Perennial Philosophy: The Case of Aldous Huxley | date=January 1948 | author=Walsh, Chad | pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948, spoke of Huxley's distinguished family background, only to continue:

{{quote|The only startling fact, and the one that could not have been predicted by the most discerning sociologist or psychologist, is that in his mid-forties he was destined to turn also to mysticism, and that since his conversion he was to be one of a small group in California busily writing books to win as many people as possible over to the "perennial philosophy" as a way of life.&lt;ref name=ChadWalsh /&gt;}}

===In the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, reviewers admired the comprehensiveness of Huxley's survey but questioned his other-worldliness and were hostile to his belief in the paranormal.

[[C. E. M. Joad]] wrote in ''[[New Statesman and Society]]'' that, although the book was a mine of learning and Huxley's commentary was profound, readers would be surprised to find that he had adopted a series of peculiar beliefs such as the curative power of relics and spiritual presences incarnated in sacramental objects. Joad pointed out that, if the argument of the book is correct, only those who have undergone the religious experiences upon which it is based are properly able to assess its worth. Further, he found that the book was dogmatic and intolerant, "in which pretty well everything we want to do is wrong."

Finally, Joad asserted that Huxley's mistake was in his "intellectual whole-hoggery" and that he was led by ideas untempered by ordinary human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Joad, C.E.M. (5 October 1946) ''Huxley Gone Sou''r, The New Statesman and Society, 32, P. 249-50 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 363–365, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', the Anglican priest Rev. [[William Inge (priest)|W. R. Inge]] remarked on the book's well chosen quotations and called it "probably the most important treatise we have had on mysticism for many years." He saw it as evidence that Huxley was now a mystical philosopher, which he regarded as an encouraging sign. Inge pointed out conflicts between religions and within religion and agreed that a [[rapprochement]] must be through mystical religion. However, he wondered if the book, with its transcendence of the personality and detachment from worldly concerns, might not be more Buddhist than Christian. He concluded his review by calling into question Huxley's belief in [[Psychic|psychical phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Inge, W.R. (April 1947) Perennial Philosophy – Review, Philosophy, XXII, pps 66–70 in Watt, Donald ed. (1997) Aldous Huxley The Critical Heritage, pps 366–368, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-15915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===

Canadian author [[John Robert Colombo]] wrote that as a young man he, like many others in the 1950s, was swept away with enthusiasm for "the coveted volume" :

{{quote|Everyone interested in consciousness studies has heard of his study called ''The Perennial Philosophy''. It bears such a prescient and memorable title. His use of the title has preempted its use by any other author, neuropsychologist, Traditionalist, or enthusiast for the [[New Age]]. The book so nobly named did much to romanticise the notion of “perennialism” and to cast into the shade such long-established timid Christian notions of “[[ecumenicism]]” ([[Protestants]] dialoguing with [[Catholics]], etc.) or “inter-faith” meetings (Christians encountering non-Christians, etc.). Who would care about the beliefs of [[Baptists]] when one could care about the practices of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetans]]?''&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

Colombo also stated that:

{{quote|Painfully absent from these pages are Huxley's mordant wit and insights into human nature. It is as if his [[wiktionary:quicksilver|quicksilverish]] intelligence has been put on hold or has found itself in a deep freeze of his own making. When it comes to selecting short and sometimes long quotations, he is no compiler like [[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] of quotation fame, but he does find time to make a few deft personal observations.&lt;ref name=Gurdjieff/&gt;}}

==Huxley's view of perennial philosophy==
{{further|Perennial philosophy}}

Huxley's Introduction to ''The Perennial Philosophy'' begins:

{{quote|The [[metaphysic]] that recognises a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical with, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]] — the thing is immemorial and universal.

Rudiments of the [[Perennial Philosophy]] may be found among the traditionary lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions. A version of this [[Highest common factor|Highest Common Factor]] in all preceding and subsequent theologies was first committed to writing more than twenty-five centuries ago, and since that time the inexhaustible theme has been treated again and again, from the standpoint of every religious tradition and in all the principal languages of Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=PP1&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the next paragraph, Huxley summarises the problem more succinctly, saying: "Knowledge is a function of being."&lt;ref name=PP1 /&gt; In other words, if you are not suited to knowing something, you do not know it. This makes knowing the Ground of All Being difficult, in Huxley's view. Therefore, he concludes his Introduction with:

{{quote|If one is not oneself a sage or saint, the best thing one can do, in the field of metaphysics, is to study the works of those who were, and who, because they had modified their merely human mode of being, were capable of a more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;(''The Perennial Philosophy'', Introduction, pages 5–6.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump''''', 847 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2017), was a lawsuit that challenged the lawfulness and [[United States Constitution|constitutionality]] of [[Executive Order 13769]], an executive order signed by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="petition6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/Complaint%20as%20Filed.pdf|title=2:17-cv-00141 State of Washington v.

A few days after the order was signed, the state of Washington filed suit alleging that the executive order is unconstitutional because it, among other reasons, violates the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantee of [[Due Process Clause|equal protection under the law]] because it was intended to harm and discriminate against their States' residents based upon their national origin or religion, and therefore it also violates the [[Establishment Clause]] because it was meant to "disfavor Islam and give preference to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;([http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf Complaint 1] ¶ 41-52, January 30, 2017) ''Washington v. Trump'' (W.D.Wash.)&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government argued that the Constitution grants the [[President of the United States]]  "unreviewable authority" over immigration matters and that the non-citizens the executive order affects do not have [[due process]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v.

On February 3, Judge [[James Robart]] issued a nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] which forbade the federal government from enforcing certain provisions of the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-obtains-court-order-halting-trump-immigration-action |title=AG FERGUSON OBTAINS COURT ORDER HALTING TRUMP IMMIGRATION ACTION |publisher=Washington State Office of the Attorney General |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government, in turn, filed an appeal with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. That court, however, denied the government's request to [[stay of proceedings|stay]] the temporary restraining order as the federal government failed to show it was likely to succeed at trial, thereby maintaining the prohibition on the government in enforcing the executive order.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/04/politics/doj-appeals-travel-ban-ruling/index.html|title=DOJ appealing travel ban ruling|author=Laura Jarrett|publisher=CNN|access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/09/appeals-court-to-issue-decision-on-trump-travel-ban-later-today.html|title=US appeals court upholds suspension of Trump travel ban|first=|last=CNBC|date=February 9, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later on January 27, he signed the executive order. Affected travelers immediately began filing legal challenges to the order through [[habeas corpus]] petitions and injunctive relief.

On January 30, 2017, the [[State of Washington]] &amp;mdash; represented by Washington State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]], with the support of Washington Governor [[Jay Inslee]]&lt;ref&gt;Jim Brunner, [http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/ag-bob-ferguson-to-make-major-announcement-in-wake-of-trump-immigration-order/ AG Bob Ferguson files lawsuit — first by any state — to invalidate Trump's order], ''Seattle Times'' (January 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;filed a civil action in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]], against Trump and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The state's suit asked the court for [[declaratory judgment|declaratory relief]] (a declaration that the executive order violates the Constitution) and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (to block enforcement of the executive order). The state also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking an immediate halt to the executive order's implementation.&lt;ref name=washag/&gt; On February 1, 2017, an amended complaint was filed adding the [[State of Minnesota]] as a plaintiff alongside Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-hearing-set-seattle-federal-court-friday TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER LAWSUIT: HEARING SET FOR SEATTLE FEDERAL COURT FRIDAY: Wash.

The Government argued that the federal courts do not have the authority to review executive actions regarding immigration because the Constitution gives the [[President of the United States]] "unreviewable authority" over immigration matters.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 13&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2017, Judge [[James Robart]] issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the enforcement of the executive order nationwide, and entered a temporary ban regarding immigration restrictions, then directed the parties to the action to file any briefs in support of a [[preliminary injunction]] by February 6, 2017.   White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement "At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this outrageous order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate. The President's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-halts-trump-travel-ban-nationwide-ag-says/index.html|title=Justice Department to challenge judge's halt of travel ban|first=Laura Jarrett, Eli Watkins and Rene Marsh|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/02/03/19717309322.pdf  2:17-cv-00141 Temporary Restraining Order ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-immigration-order-nationwide/2017/02/03/9b734e1c-ea54-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html|title=Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's entry order nationwide|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|author1=Matt Zapotosky|author2=Lori Aratani|author3=Justin Jouvenal|work=National Security|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15I1CM|title=Seattle judge blocks Trump's travel ban; White House to appeal|publisher=[[Reuters]]|author1=Dan Levine|author2=Scott Malone|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 4, 2017|quote=For Trump's order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be "based in fact, as opposed to fiction."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spicer immediately issued an updated statement removing the word 'outrageous'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the proceedings, Judge Robart asked the federal government lawyer how many arrests of foreign nationals from the listed countries had occurred since 9/11. No numbers were offered by the defense and the judge incorrectly answered his own question by stating that none had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Eric. (February 6, 2017).

Trump responded by tweeting, "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/827867311054974976|title=Donald J.

With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Cour]]t.

On March 13, 2017 the Washington State Attorney General filed a second amended complaint addressing executive order 13780 and moved the court to enjoin enforcement of the order under the current preliminary injunction previously issued which barred enforcement of executive order 13769 by filing a motion for emergency enforcement of the preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-seeks-travel-ban-hearing-tuesday-new-court-filings|title=AG Ferguson seeks travel-ban hearing Tuesday; new court filings - Washington State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/Emergency%20Motion%20to%20Enforce%20Preliminary%20Injunction%2003-13-2017.pdf Case No. C17-0141JLR Emergency Motion to Enforce Preliminary Injunction]&lt;/ref&gt;  The State of Washington in their second amended complaint asked the Court to Declare that Sections 3(c), 5(a)–(c), and 5(e) of the First Executive Order 13769 are unauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the United States should be enjoined from implementing or enforcing Sections 3(c), 5(a)–(c), and 5(e) of the First Executive Order, including at all United States borders, ports of entry, and in the issuance of visas, pending further orders from this Court.

unauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the United States should also be enjoined from implementing or enforcing Sections 2(c) and 6(a) of the Second Executive Order 13780, including at all United States borders, ports of entry, and in the issuance of visas, and enjoin the United States from implementing or enforcing Section 5(d) of the First Executive Order 13769 and enjoin the United States from implementing or enforcing Section 6(b) of the Second Executive Order 13780.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/SecondAmendedComplaintCombo03-13-2017.pdf Case No. C17-0141JLR Second Amended Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Court subsequently issued an order directing the United States to file a response to the emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction by March 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/RobartOrder031317.pdf Case No. C17-0141JLR Order Regarding Motion to Enforce Preliminary Injunction]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2017, the United States filed an emergency motion in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], seeking a stay of the District Court's temporary restraining order. In its request, the federal government contended that the temporary restraining order should be stayed because the judicial branch lacks the authority to review presidential actions over immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf 2:17-cv-00141 State of Washington v.

It prevented a number of Hawaii's residents from traveling abroad. It required Hawaii to participate in discrimination against members of the Muslim faith."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This brings the total number of companies in support of the challenge to 156.

===Denial of stay===
On February 9, the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in a [[per curiam decision]], unanimously denied the request for a stay of the temporary restraining order. The court, quoting the Supreme Court case ''[[Nken v. Holder]]'', made clear that "a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result."&lt;ref name=9th18&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' No. 17-35105 (9th Circ.), slip op. at 18&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the court needed to answer four questions under ''Nken'', with the first two being most important: "(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings; and (4) where the public interest lies."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 18 quoting {{ussc|name=Nken v. Holder|volume=556|page=418|pin=434|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=9th18 /&gt; The court denied the stay as they found the federal government failed to prove the first two questions, and that the last two tip in favor of the plaintiffs, Washington and Minnesota.

The court ruled that the federal government is unlikely to succeed on the merits against Washington's due process claim. Though the court discussed Washington State's contention that the executive order violates the [[First Amendment]] prohibition on religious discrimination, they withheld ruling on that claim, as being unlikely to succeed against a due process claim is sufficient to fail the first question. The federal government did not provide evidence or argument as to why the executive order needed to be enacted immediately and thus a stay required.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 26-27 ("Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the [Federal] Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.")&lt;/ref&gt; In showing the federal government was unlikely to succeed on the merits against a due process claim, the court argued that it showed the States and their citizens would be irreparably harmed by a stay as "the deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28, quoting {{ussc|name=Elrod v. Burns|volume=427|page=347|pin=373|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that "aspects of the public interest favor both sides", but that in light of the prior three questions, "these competing public inteterests do not justify a stay."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''En banc'' proceedings ===
The day after the denial of stay, the 9th Circuit ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether the motion should be reheard ''[[en banc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/10/17-35105_Supplemental%20Briefing%20Order.pdf Supplemental briefing order], ''Washington v. Trump'', No. 17-35105, (9th Cir. February 10, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The order was issued at the request of an unidentified judge of the Ninth Circuit to be voted on by all 25 active judges (though, if successful, a rehearing would be by a panel of 11 judges). The parties were instructed to submit their briefs by February 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-court-idUSKBN15O2XS|title=Trump Weighs Revised Travel Ban, Supreme Court Test Still Possible|publisher=Reuters|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, the Trump administration asked to postpone further proceedings because they expected to replace executive order with a new one the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-says-hell-issue-a-new-executive-order-on-immigration-by-next-week/2017/02/16/4b65e7d6-f463-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html|title=Trump says he'll issue a new executive order on immigration by next week|last=Zapotosky|first=Matt|date=2017-02-16|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the 9th Circuit issued an order on the same day staying the ''en banc'' review of its previous ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/16/17-35105_Stay%20Order%20revised.pdf Stay Order for En-Banc Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dismissal of the appeal ===
On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued [[Executive Order 13780]], which revoked and replaced Executive Order 13769 (at issue in this appeal). Two days later, on March 8, 2017, the government moved to dismiss the appeal as moot, which the Court granted the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/08/Motion%20to%20Dismiss%20Voluntarily.pdf 17-35105 Motion to Dismiss Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/08/17-35105%20-%20Order%20to%20Dismiss%20Granted.pdf 17-35105 Order Dismissing Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further ''en banc'' proceedings===
On March 15, 2017, the Ninth Circuit denied rehearing ''en banc''.&lt;ref name=buzzfeed15&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geidner|first1=Chris|title=Federal Appeals Court Will Let Ruling Against Trump's Original Travel Ban Stand|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-appeals-court-will-let-ruling-against-trumps|accessdate=26 March 2017|work=[[BuzzFeed]] News|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] added a concurrence, alone, where he wrote "I am proud to be a part of this court and a judicial system that is independent and courageous".&lt;ref name=buzzfeed15/&gt;

Judge [[Jay Bybee]], joined by Judges [[Alex Kozinski]], [[Consuelo María Callahan]], [[Carlos Bea]], and [[Sandra Segal Ikuta]] dissented from denial of reconsideration, writing that the court had committed "manifest error".&lt;ref name=buzzfeed15/&gt;

On March 17, Judge Kozinski, joined by the other dissenters, added another opinion dissenting from denial of reconsideration.&lt;ref name=mar17ca9&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7212509001957517972&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''State of Washington v.

Mar. 17, 2017) (order denied denying reconsideration ''en banc'').]&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Bea, joined by the other dissenters also added an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing.&lt;ref name=mar17ca9/&gt;  Judge [[Marsha S. Berzon]], however, alone, added a concurrence to the denial of reconsideration where he criticized the dissenters for the procedural irregularity of attempting to reconsider a case without a request by either party and after the appeal had been dismissed.&lt;ref name=mar17ca9/&gt;

===New executive order===
On March 17, 2017, Judge Robart refused to grant an additional restraining order after the President's new [[Executive Order 13780]] was blocked by U.S. District Judge [[Derrick Watson]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].

===The U.S. Supreme Court===
In a [[Per curiam decision|''per curiam'' decision]], on June 26, 2017, the United States Supreme Court reinstated key provisions narrowed to apply only to foreign nationals who have no "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States" and set case for final consideration in October.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202791293240/Supreme-Court-Narrows-TravelBan-Injunctions-Puts-Case-on-October-Calendar?slreturn=20170608215237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reporter, Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court.

In an unsigned statement the Supreme Court stated that denying entry to foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States "does not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national."

==History==
''Yamabushi'' began as ''yamahoshi'', isolated clusters (or individuals) of mountain hermits, ascetics, and "holy men", who followed the path of ''shugendō'', a search for spiritual, mystical, or supernatural powers gained through asceticism. This path may or may not have had a founder, as the myths surrounding [[En no Gyōja]] are numerous and complex; he is quite similar to a Japanese [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] in this way. Men who followed this path came to be known by a variety of names, including ''kenja'', ''kenza'', and ''[[shugenja]]''. These mountain mystics came to be renowned for their magical abilities and [[occult]] knowledge, and were sought out as healers or mediums, although [[Shinto shrines]] had traditionally reserved this role exclusively for maidens known as [[Miko]].

Most of these ascetics, in addition to their devotion to ''shugendō'', studied the teachings of the [[Tendai]] sect of Buddhism, or the Shingon sect, established by [[Kūkai|Kōbō Daishi]] in the 8th century. [[Shingon|Shingon Buddhism]] was one of the primary sects of ''mikkyō'' (密教) or [[Esoteric Buddhism]], according to which enlightenment is found through isolation, and the study and contemplation of oneself, as well as nature, and esoteric images called [[mandala]]. Both the Shingon sect and the Tendai viewed mountains as the ideal place for this sort of isolation and contemplation of nature.

In their mountain retreats, these monks studied not only nature and religious/spiritual texts and images, but also a variety of martial arts. Whether they felt they had to defend themselves from bandits, other monks, or samurai armies is questionable, but the idea of studying martial arts as a means to improve oneself mentally and spiritually, not just physically, has always been central to Japanese culture, beyond the specific tenets of one religious sect or another. Additionally, the Yamabushi developed their own forms of cooking that utilized vegetation that was naturally found on the mountains where they trained.  This cuisine allowed them to spend weeks or even months in the mountains without having to venture down into the towns or cities below to restock on supplies. Thus, like the ''sōhei'', the ''yamabushi''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehiddenjapan.com/yamabushi|title=Yamabushi Mountain Monks Of Yamagata|website=Yamagata {{!}} Shonai {{!}} The Hidden Japan|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; became warriors as well as monks.

As their reputation for mystical insight and knowledge grew, and their organization grew tighter, many of the masters of the ascetic disciplines began to be appointed to high spiritual positions in the court hierarchy. Monks and temples began to gain political influence. By the [[Nanboku-chō]] Period, in the 13th and 14th centuries, the ''yamabushi'' had formed organized cohorts called ''konsha'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yamabushi.org.uk/yamabushi.html|title=Yamabushi Page|website=Yamabushi Judo Club|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=October 2017}} and these ''konsha'', along with ''sōhei'' and other monks began to take direction from the central temples of their sects. They assisted [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] in his attempts to overthrow the [[Kamakura shogunate]], and proved their warrior skills to be up to the challenge of fighting professional samurai armies.

Several centuries later, in the [[Sengoku Period]], ''yamabushi'' could be found among the advisers and armies of nearly every major contender for dominion over [[Japan]]. Some, led by [[Takeda Shingen]], aided [[Oda Nobunaga]] against [[Uesugi Kenshin]] in 1568, while others, including the abbot [[Sessai Choro]], advised [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Many fought alongside their fellow monks, the ''[[Ikkō-ikki]]'', against [[Oda Nobunaga|Nobunaga]], who eventually crushed them and put an end to the time of the warrior monks.

Yamabushi also served as ''sendatsu'', or spiritual mountain guides, since medieval times for pilgrims along the [[Kumano Kodo]] to the Kumano Sanzan, including retired emperors and aristocrats.
