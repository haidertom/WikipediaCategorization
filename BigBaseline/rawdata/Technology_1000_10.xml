'''1:1 pixel mapping''' is a video display technique applicable to devices with native fixed [[pixels]], such as [[LCD monitor]]s and [[plasma display]]s. A monitor that has been set to 1:1 pixel mapping will display an input source without scaling it, such that each [[pixel]] received is mapped to a single native pixel on the monitor. This technique avoids loss of sharpness due to scaling artifacts and normally{{Efn|Except the uncommon case where display and input differ in [[pixel aspect ratio]] such as when one doesn't use [[square pixels]]}} avoids incorrect [[aspect ratio]] due to stretching. If the input [[Display resolution|resolution]] is less than the monitor's [[native resolution]], this will result in black borders around the image (e.g. [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] or [[windowboxing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sayer|first1=Rob|title=Guide to Pixel Mapping|url=http://www.onstagelighting.co.uk/lighting-equipment/stage-lighting-control/guide-to-pixel-mapping/|website=onstagelighting.co.uk|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drawbaugh|first1=Ben|title=Does your HDTV support 1:1 pixel mapping?|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/20/does-your-hdtv-support-1-1-pixel-mapping/|website=Engadget|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2degrees''' is a [[telecommunications provider]] that operates in [[New Zealand]]. Its [[mobile network]] launched on 4 August 2009 after nine years of planning. 2degrees offers prepaid and pay-monthly monthly mobile services as well as fixed-line phone and broadband services.

It has spent over NZ$550 million building its mobile network, which {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} covers Ashburton, Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, Hastings, Invercargill, Levin, Napier, Nelson, New Plymouth, Oamaru, Palmerston North, Queenstown, Rotorua, Taupo, Tauranga, Timaru, Wanganui, Wellington and Whangarei. The network works with [[GSM frequency bands#GSM-900, GSM-1800 and EGSM/EGSM-900|GSM-900]], [[UMTS frequency bands#UMTS-FDD|UMTS-900]] and [[UMTS frequency bands#UMTS-FDD|UMTS-2100]] mobiles, similar to the competing Vodafone network. In areas without 2degrees coverage, handsets [[Roaming|roam]] on [[Vodafone NZ]]'s GSM and UMTS network. 2degrees refers to areas where it has its own 3G coverage as "mobile broadband zones".

2degrees is majority owned by US-based [[Trilogy International Partners]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/tesbrit-gets-greenlight-buy-499-2degrees-should-opportunity-arise-b-205905|title=Tesbrit gets greenlight to buy up to 49.9% of 2degrees|date=2017-07-31|work=The National Business Review|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 2degrees announced it had acquired Snap,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
a broadband-based ISP, and from 28 July began offering broadband and home-phone services in addition to existing mobile services.

==Naming==
The name of the company refers to a local variation of the [[six degrees of separation]] concept.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2400954"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/2400954/Wellington-Manukau-frustrate-2degrees|title=Wellington, Manukau frustrate 2degrees|author=Jenny Keown &amp; Tom Pullar-Strecker|date=11 May 2009|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=11 September 2011 | quote = 2degrees is a play on the 'six degrees' of separation that are said to separate people on Earth, reflecting the closeness of the New Zealand community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network==
2degrees was formerly known as NZ Communications and previously as [[Econet Wireless]]. Planning began in 2000 but details were not revealed until 11 May 2009 and pricing was announced a day before launch. 2degrees accepted its first customers 4 August 2009 for 2G calling/txting only. A year later on 3 August 2010 3G was turned on and new data plans announced for use in areas where 2degrees has its cell towers. 2degrees launched its 4G network in 2014.

===Coverage===
2degrees initially did not have nationwide mobile coverage, but its own network has been extended to many towns, cities and rural areas. Users can seamlessly roam onto [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone's]] network in places where 2degrees has no cell towers however 2degrees now has coverage of 97.5% of places New Zealanders live and work.

Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI): 2degrees mobile phones can roam onto RBI cell sites. These rural cell sites are open access for all internet providers in New Zealand to buy wholesale packages and retail them to rural customers for household and business use. 2Degrees mobile phones automatically roam to these cell sites were available due to the roaming agreement with Vodafone. RBI has Vodafone installing 154 new rural cell towers and upgrading 265 towers to provide 3G and later 4G services, between 2011 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/network/rural/| title=Our Rural Network| publisher=Vodafone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spark.co.nz/rural-broadband| title=The Government's Rural Broadband Initiative| publisher=Telecom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2degrees towers have been deployed in these locations with 2G and 3G coverage (additionally 4G where noted):

2degrees also operated a [[Wi-fi]] network in Wellington city. The network was on a trial with some selected members of the public (about 20,000 people).

As of 2014, 4G LTE services are on (band 3) 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz. In addition (band 28) 700&amp;nbsp;MHz is on trial in central Auckland; 700&amp;nbsp;MHz ought to be able to penetrate large buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/company/news#151|title = Hamilton LTE Press Statement|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2017, 2degrees announced they would be shutting down the 2G network on 15 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/company/news-and-media-releases/2degrees-to-close-down-2g-access-in-march-2018|title=2degrees to close down 2G access in March 2018 {{!}} 2degrees Mobile|date=2017-09-15|work=2degrees Mobile|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vodafone National Roaming===

In some places where 2degrees has no telecommunications towers, users can [[roaming|roam]] on the [[Vodafone New Zealand]] 3G (UMTS) network. While roaming on the Vodafone network, users cannot use broadband "zone data packs" or "data clock"; but minutes, text messages and included "NZ carryover plan data", and "NZ data packs" can be used.

The company provides mobile services on its own cellular network. With support for 3G (UMTS 900MHz and 2100MHz) and 4G (LTE 700MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz). WiFi Calling is also supported (handset dependent).

===New features===
2degrees have a number of new features not found on other New Zealand mobile phone networks, including:
* Using [[USSD]] (*100#) to check and top up account balance. The quickcode *100*1# can be added as a speed-dial to most phones to quickly check balance.
* Using *101# to display the phone number of the sim.
* Using *110# to display the number of minutes and data left until the end of the billing period. 
* The ability to get settings from the [[SIM Application Toolkit|SIM menu]]
* WiFi calling.

===MNC and dialing codes===
The [[mobile network code]] is 530-24. NZ-24 or NZ Comms may be displayed on the mobile phones network list. On modern phones, with recent firmware 2degrees will be displayed.

The native STD prefix for the network is 022.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_2724433"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/third-mobile-telco-rebrands-2degrees-2724433|title=Third mobile telco rebrands as 2degrees|date=11 May 2009|work=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has [[mobile number portability]], so customers switching from other networks may keep their existing mobile number.

===Inbound roaming===
2degrees (still called NZ Communications on the Three website and Telstra roaming site) is open to customers with handsets from some foreign networks, including [[Hutchison 3G|Three]], [[Telstra]] and [[Orange UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.three.co.uk/Help_Support/International/Going_abroad_Pay_Monthly/Destination_Details?content_aid=1214306364761 |title=Three - Help &amp; Support - International - Going abroad - Pay Monthly - Destination Details |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930125017/http://www.three.co.uk/Help_Support/International/Going_abroad_Pay_Monthly/Destination_Details?content_aid=1214306364761 |archivedate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These foreign customers can place calls using 2degrees cell sites in cities, towns and localities New Zealand described as broadband zones by 2degrees.

===Expansion===
In February 2011 2degrees announced that they had obtained financing for a further $100 million network expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.2degreesmobile.co.nz/media/2degrees-invests-in-network-and-future-growth|title=2degrees invests in network and future growth|work=2degreesmobile.co.nz}}/&lt;/ref&gt;

2degrees have an ongoing network expansion in place, having recently secured financing to further expand its network and roll out a 4G LTE network.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==History==
In 1999, the New Zealand Government auctioned off 3G spectrum radio spectrum licence. Rangiaho Everton claimed that the auction breached the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] because she believed radio spectrum is [[taonga]] and the government has no right to sell it. Everton lodged a claim with the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], which was upheld. It was not until [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour]] won the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]] that Māori were allocated one of the four 2&amp;nbsp;GHz 3G spectrum licences at a discounted price plus $5 million to develop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gnewsroom.com/country/new_zealand.shtml |title=3gnewsroom.com - 3gnewsroom Resources and Information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBR2010-07-28&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/2degrees-shareholder-eyes-growth-nz-126853|title=2degrees shareholder eyes growth in NZ|date=28 July 2010|work=The National Business Review|agency=[[NZPA]]|access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aLittleAbout&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/company/|title=A little about us|work=2degreesmobile.com website|access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2001, Simon "Tex" Edwards, a former banker, established NZ Communications Limited.&lt;ref name=aLittleAbout/&gt; Later in 2001, NZ Communications received further financial backing from [[Strive Masiyiwa]]'s [[Econet Wireless]], which Edwards also owns shares, and then a 30% stake from the Hautaki Trust, which is the trading arm of the pan-Maori trust Te Hauarahi Tika.&lt;ref name=NBR2010-07-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=aLittleAbout/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZimToday2017-04-23&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zimbabwe-today.com/strive-masiyiwa-zimbabwe-businessman-2/|title=Strive Masiyiwa Zimbabwe Businessman|date=23 April 2017|work=Zimbabwe Today||access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODT2012-07-10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/business/2degrees-founder-ousted|title=2degrees founder ousted|date=10 July 2012|newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]]||agency=[[APNZ]]|access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, NZ Communications Ltd began building towers for New Zealand's third mobile network.&lt;ref name=aLittleAbout/&gt;

In 2009, NZ Communications changed its name to 2degrees and began a roaming deal with Vodafone New Zealand. The deal allowed NZ Communications' customers to automatically roam onto Vodafone's 2G network. At the time the deal was announced, it was suggested the deal might also be expanded to include roaming on Vodafone's 3G network too at NZ Communications' request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/164209 | title=NZ Communications inks roaming deal | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=1 January 2009 | agency=NZPA | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, Trilogy increased its stake from 26% to 52% while the Hautaki Trust stake was reduced from 20% to 13%, and [[Eric Hertz]] replaced Mike Reynolds as CEO in July.&lt;ref name=NBR2010-07-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBR2009-07-15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/breaking-news-2degress-boss-quits-just-ahead-launch-105566 |title=2degress boss quits just ahead of launch|author=Keall, Chris|date=15 July 2009|work=[[National Business Review]]|accessdate=15 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721190847/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/breaking-news-2degress-boss-quits-just-ahead-launch-105566|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bussard ramjet''' is a theoretical method of [[spacecraft propulsion]] proposed in 1960 by the physicist [[Robert W. Bussard]], popularized by  [[Poul Anderson]]'s novel ''[[Tau Zero]]'', [[Larry Niven]] in his ''[[Known Space]]'' series of books, [[Vernor Vinge]] in his ''[[Zones of Thought]]'' series, and referred to by [[Carl Sagan]] in the [[television]] series and [[Cosmos (book)|book]] ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''.

&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a [[ramjet]] variant of a [[fusion rocket]] capable of reasonable [[interstellar travel]], using enormous electromagnetic fields (ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter) as a ram scoop to collect and compress [[hydrogen]] from the [[interstellar medium]]. High speeds force the reactive mass into a progressively constricted magnetic field, compressing it until [[thermonuclear fusion]] occurs. The magnetic field then directs the energy as [[rocket]] exhaust opposite to the intended direction of travel, thereby accelerating the vessel.

== Feasibility ==

Since the time of Bussard's original proposal, it has been discovered that the region surrounding the [[Solar System]] has a much lower density of hydrogen than was believed at that time (see [[Local Interstellar Cloud]]). John Ford Fishback made an important contribution to the details for the Bussard ramjet in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fishback |first=J. F. |year=1969 |title=Relativistic interstellar spaceflight |journal=Astronautica Acta |volume=15 |pages=25–35 |bibcode=1969AsAc...15...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt; T. A. Heppenheimer analyzed Bussard's original suggestion of fusing [[protons]], but found the [[Bremsstrahlung]] losses from compressing protons to [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] densities was greater than the power that could be produced by a factor of about 1 billion, thus indicating that the proposed version of the Bussard ramjet was infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.A. |last=Heppenheimer |title=On the Infeasibility of Interstellar Ramjets |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=31 |page=222 |year=1978|bibcode = 1978JBIS...31..222H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However Daniel P. Whitmire's 1975 analysis&lt;ref name="Whitmire1975"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel P. |last=Whitmire |title=Relativistic Spaceflight and the Catalytic Nuclear Ramjet |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=2 |issue=5-6 |date=May–June 1975 |pages=497–509 |doi=10.1016/0094-5765(75)90063-6 |url=http://www.askmar.com/Robert%20Bussard/Catalytic%20Nuclear%20Ramjet.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode = 1975AcAau...2..497W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  indicates that a ramjet may achieve net power via the [[CNO cycle]], which produces fusion at a much higher rate (~10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; times higher) than the [[proton-proton chain]].

[[Robert Zubrin]] and Dana Andrews analyzed one hypothetical version of the Bussard ramscoop and [[ramjet]] design in 1985. They determined that their version of the ramjet would be unable to accelerate into the solar wind. However, in their calculations they assumed that:

# The exhaust velocity of their interplanetary ion propulsion ramjet could not exceed 100,000&amp;nbsp;m/s (100&amp;nbsp;km/s);
# The largest available energy source could be a 500 [[kilowatt]] [[nuclear fusion]] reactor.

In the Zubrin/Andrews interplanetary ramjet design, they calculated that the drag force d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) equals the mass of the scooped ions collected per second multiplied by the velocity of the scooped ions within the solar system relative to the ramscoop. The velocity of the (scooped) collected ions from the solar wind was assumed to be 500,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.

The exhaust velocity of the ions when expelled by the ramjet was assumed not to exceed 100,000&amp;nbsp;m/s. The thrust of the ramjet d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was equal to the mass of ions expelled per second multiplied by 100,000 meters per second. In the Zubrin/Andrews design of 1985, this resulted in the condition that d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; d/dt(''mv''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This condition resulted in the drag force exceeding the thrust of the hypothetical ramjet in the Zubrin/Andrews version of the design.

===Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR)===
The problem of using the interstellar medium as the sole fuel source led to study of the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR). The RAIR carries its nuclear fuel supply and exhausts the reaction products to produce some of its thrust. However it greatly enhances its performance by scooping the interstellar medium and  using this as extra reaction mass to augment the rocket. The propulsion system of the RAIR consists of three subsystems: a fusion reactor, a scoop field, and a plasma accelerator. The scoop field funnels interstellar gas into an "accelerator" (this could for example be a heat exchange system transferring thermal energy from the reactor directly to the interstellar gas) which is supplied power from a reactor. One of the best ways to understand this concept is to consider that the hydrogen nuclear fuel carried on board acts as a fuel (energy source) whereas the interstellar gas collected by the scoop and then exhausted at great speed from the back acts as a propellant (the [[Working mass|reaction mass]]), the vehicle therefore has a limited fuel supply but an unlimited propellant supply. A normal Bussard ramjet would have an infinite supply of both, however theory suggests that where a Bussard ramjet would suffer drag from the fact that the interstellar gas ahead of it would have to be accelerated to its speed before entering the fusion reactor, whereas a RAIR system would be able to transfer energy via the "accelerator" mechanism from the reactor to the interstellar gas without having to accelerate the gas up to the ship's speed before putting this gas through the "accelerator", and so would suffer far less drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bond |first=A. |year=1974 |title=An Analysis of the Potential Performance of the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=27 |pages=674–688|bibcode = 1974JBIS...27..674B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=C. |year=1976 |title=System Optimization for the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=136|bibcode = 1976JBIS...29..136P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=A. |year=1980 |title=Some Considerations on the Antimatter and Fusion Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=33 |pages=117–120|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..117J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further information on this RAIR concept can be found in the book "the star flight handbook" and at http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/slowerlight.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser Powered Interstellar Ramjet ===
Beamed energy coupled with a vehicle scooping hydrogen from the interstellar medium is another variant. A laser array in the solar system beams to a collector on a vehicle which uses something like a linear accelerator to produce thrust. This solves the fusion reactor problem for the ramjet. There are limitations because of the attenuation of beamed energy with distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitmire |first=D. |author2 = Jackson.A|year=1977 |title= Laser Powered Interstellar Ramjet |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=30 |pages=223–226|bibcode = 1977JBIS...30..223J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic sail===
The calculations (by [[Robert Zubrin]] and an associate) inspired the idea of a [[magnetic sail|magnetic parachute or sail]]. This could be important for interstellar travel because it means that deceleration at the destination can be performed with a magnetic parachute rather than a rocket.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Pre-seeded trajectory===
Several of the obvious technical difficulties with the Bussard ramjet can be overcome by prelaunching fuel along the spacecraft's trajectory&lt;ref&gt;Discussed on {{cite book |last=Gilster |first=P. |year=2004 |title=Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fffd3SivkC&amp;pg=PA146 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-00436-5 |pages=146–8}} Also in the entry [http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=315 'A Fusion Runway to Nearby Stars'] from centauri-dreams.org.&lt;/ref&gt; using something like a magnetic rail-gun.

The advantages of this system include
*Launching only ionized fusion fuel so that either magnetic or electrostatic scoops can more easily funnel the fuel into the engine.  The drawback is this will cause the fuel to disperse due to electrostatic repulsion.
*Launching the fuel on a trajectory so that the fuel velocity vector will closely match the expected velocity vector of the spacecraft at that point in its trajectory.  This will minimize the "drag" forces generated by the collection of fuel.
*Launching optimized isotope ratios for the fusion engines on the spacecraft.  A conventional Bussard ramjet will mostly collect hydrogen with an atomic weight of 1.  This isotope is harder to fuse than either the [[deuterium]] or [[tritium]] isotopes of hydrogen.  By launching the ideal ratio of hydrogen isotopes for the fusion engine in the spacecraft one can optimize the performance of the fusion engine.
*Although the prelaunched fuel for the ramjet negates one advantage of the Bussard design (collection of fuel as it moves through the interstellar medium) it retains the advantage of not having to accelerate the mass of the fuel and the mass of the rocket at the same time.
*The prelaunched fuel would provide some visibility into the interstellar medium &amp;ndash; thus alerting the trailing spacecraft of unseen hazards (e.g. [[brown dwarf]]s).

The major disadvantages of this system include
*The spacecraft could not deviate from the precalculated trajectory unless it was critical to do so.  Any such deviation would separate the spacecraft from its fuel supply and leave it with only a minimal ability to return to its original trajectory.
*Prelaunched fuel for deceleration at the destination star would not be available unless launched many decades in advance of the spacecraft launch.  However, other systems (such as the [[magnetic sail]]s) could be used for this purpose.

}}A '''cellular repeater''' (also known as cell phone signal booster or amplifier) is a type of [[bi-directional amplifier]] used to improve [[cell phone]] reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3554602 |title=Global Signal Booster Market- Evolving Technology Trends and Industry Analysis|date=|publisher= |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cellular repeater system commonly consists of a donor [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] that receives and transmits signal from nearby cell towers, coaxial cables, a signal amplifier, and an indoor rebroadcast [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.repeaterstore.com/pages/cell-phone-repeaters|title=Cell Phone Repeaters – What They Are &amp; How They Work|date=|publisher= |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common components==
===Donor antenna===
A "donor antenna" is typically installed by a window or on the roof a building and used to communicate back to a nearby cell tower.  A donor antenna can be any of several types, but is usually [[Directional antenna|directional]] or [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]].  An omnidirectional antenna (which broadcast in all directions) is typically used for a repeater system that amplify coverage for all cellular carriers.  A directional antenna is used when a particular tower or carrier needs to be isolated for improvement.  The use of a highly directional antenna can help improve the donor's [[signal-to-noise ratio]], thus improving the quality of signal redistributed inside a building.

===Indoor antenna===
Some cellular repeater systems can also include an omnidirectional antenna for rebroadcasting the signal indoors.  Depending on attenuation from obstacles, the advantage of using an omnidirectional antenna is that the signal will be equally distributed in all directions.

===Signal amplifier===
Celullar repeater systems include a [[signal amplifier]]. Standard GSM channel selective repeaters (operated by telecommunication operators for coverage of large areas and big buildings) have output power around 2&amp;nbsp;W, high power repeaters have output power around 10&amp;nbsp;W.  The power gain is calculated by the following equation:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\quad P_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P}{P_0} \right) \ 
&lt;/math&gt;
A repeater needs to secure sufficient isolation between the donor and the service antenna. When the isolation is lower than actual gain plus a margin (of typically 5–15&amp;nbsp;dB), the repeater may go into in loop oscillation.  This oscillation can cause interference to the cellular network.

The isolation may be improved by antenna type selection in a macro environment, which involves adjusting the angle between the donor and service antennas (ideally 180°), space separation (typically the vertical distance in the case of the tower installation between donor and service antenna is several meters), insertion into an attenuating environment (e.g. installing a metal mesh between donor and service antennas), and/or reduction of reflections (no near obstacles in front of the donor antenna such as trees or buildings).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Isolation can be also improved by integrated feature called ICE (interference cancellation equipment) offered in some products (e.g., NodeG, RFWindow). Activation of this feature has a negative impact on internal delay (higher delay =&gt; approximately +5&amp;nbsp;μs up to standard rep. delay) and consequently a shorter radius from donor site.  Amplification and filtering introduce a delay (typically between 5 and 15&amp;nbsp;μs), depending on the type of repeater and features used.  Additional distance also adds propagation delay.

==Reasons for weak signal==
===Rural areas===
In many rural areas the housing density is too low to make construction of a new [[base station]] commercially viable.  Installing a home cellular repeater may remedy this.  In flat rural areas the signal is unlikely to suffer from [[multipath interference]].  

===Building construction material===
Certain construction materials can attenuate cell phone signal strength. Older buildings, such as churches, often block celullar signals. Any building that has a significant thickness of concrete, or a large amount of metal used in its construction, will attenuate the signal. Concrete floors are often poured onto a metal pan, which completely blocks most radio signals. Some solid foam insulation and some fiberglass insulation used in roofs or exterior walls have foil backing, which can reduce transmittance. Energy efficient windows and metal window screens are also very effective at blocking radio signals. Some materials have peaks in their [[absorption spectra]], which decrease signal strength.

===Building size===
Large buildings, such as warehouses, hospitals, and factories, often lack cellular reception. Low signal strength also tends to occur in underground areas (such as basements, and in shops and restaurants located towards the centre of [[shopping mall]]s).  In these cases, an external antenna is usually used.

===Multipath interference===
Even in urban areas (which usually have strong cellular signals throughout), there may be [[Dead zone (cell phone)|dead zones]] caused by [[destructive interference]] of waves.  These usually have an area of a few blocks and will usually only affect one of the two frequency ranges used by cell phones. This happens because different wavelengths of the different frequencies interfere destructively at different points. [[Directional antenna]]s can be helpful at overcoming this issue since they may be used to select a single path from several (see [[Multipath interference]] for more details).

===Diffraction and general attenuation===
The longer [[wavelengths]] have the advantage of diffracting more, and so line of sight is not as necessary to obtain a good signal.  Because the frequencies that cell phones use are too high to reflect off the [[ionosphere]] as [[shortwave radio]] waves do, cell phone waves cannot travel via the ionosphere.  (See [[Diffraction]] and [[Attenuation]] for more details).

==Different operating frequencies==
Repeaters are available for all of the [[GSM frequency bands]]. Some repeaters will handle different types of networks (such as multi-mode GSM and [[UMTS]]).  Repeater systems are available for certain [[Satellite phone]] systems, allowing these to be used indoors without a clear line of sight to the satellite.

==Approval in the USA by the FCC==
It used to be legal to use the low power devices available for home and small scale use in commercial areas (offices, shops, bars, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/index.do?document=305599|title=FCC ruling on cellular repeaters|date=|publisher=The Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2013, the [http://www.fcc.gov/document/use-and-design-signal-boosters-report-and-order FCC released a Report &amp; Order], thus establishing two Safe Harbors and defining the use of "network safe" consumer boosters on licensed spectrum. The Safe Harbors represent a compromise solution between Technology Manufacturers and Wireless Operators. Only a few companies have a product compatible with the new FCC regulations.

'''The FCC has defined two types of repeaters:'''

# Wide-band (or broadband) signal boosters are usually repeaters that amplify all frequencies from cell phone carriers. Because interferences can be generated from such boosters, the manufacturers who apply to the FCC must limit their gain (among other things), to 65&amp;nbsp;dB (for the low LTE 700MHz bands) to 72&amp;nbsp;dB (for higher frequencies such as AWS). By limiting the system gain, such boosters are only useful when the outdoor signal is relatively high, and need a complex outdoor installation of specific antennas.
# Carrier specific (or provider specific) signal boosters. These boosters are only designed to boost those frequencies (and signal) that belong to a particular carrier. Usually, such carrier specific boosters do not produce interferences on other carrier's frequencies, and are allowed to have much larger system gains (sometimes 100&amp;nbsp;dB). In these conditions, such devices boost signal in a larger coverage area, and can still be efficient when outdoor carrier signals are weak, but are only boosting the signal for the carrier it is designed to operate.

These new rules by the FCC were implemented on March 1, 2014. Here are the [http://www.fcc.gov/document/use-and-design-signal-boosters-report-and-order rules].

==Approval in the UK by Ofcom and the UK market==
In May 2011, [[Ofcom]] stated the following:

Installation or use of repeater devices (as with any radio equipment) is a criminal offence unless two conditions are satisfied:

# That the equipment is CE marked, indicating that the manufacturer has declared that it complies with all relevant EU regulatory requirements, including the Radio equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&amp;TTE) Directive;
# That the use of the equipment is specifically authorised in the UK, either via a licence or by regulations made by Ofcom to exempt the use from licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/mobile-wireless-broadband/cellular-wireless-broadband/policy-and-background/repeaters-boosters/|title=Ofcom &amp;#124; Repeaters / Boosters / Enhancers|date=|publisher=Licensing.ofcom.org.uk|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under WT Act 2006 section 1.15, the wireless act also allows an exemption if the device does not "involve undue interference with wireless telegraphy". This is expected to follow the US-style regulations where a mobile repeater must have protection built in against interference.

[[Ofcom]] stated that "Repeater devices transmit or re-transmit in the cellular frequency bands. Only the mobile network operators are licensed to use equipment that transmits in these bands. Installation or use of repeater devices by anyone without a licence is a criminal offence under Section 8 of the WT Act 2006."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/jammers/|title=Mobile phone jammers and cellular enhancers|publisher=OFCOM|work=OFCOM Enforcing the Radio Spectrum|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters operating in rural and less densely populated areas do not pose a quantifiable problem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A '''changelog''' is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project.  The project is often a [[website]] or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.  Some [[Open-source software|open source]] projects include a changelog as one of the top level files in their distribution.

A changelog has historically included all changes made to a project.  The "Keep a CHANGELOG" site instead advocates that a changelog ''not'' include ''all'' changes, but that it should instead contain "a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project" and should not be a "dump" of a git log "because this helps nobody".&lt;ref name="keepachangelog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keepachangelog.com |title=Keep a CHANGELOG |date= |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the canonical naming convention for the file is ''ChangeLog'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Gnits.html#Gnits The GNU automake manual]&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes alternatively named as ''CHANGES'' or ''HISTORY'' (''NEWS'' is usually a different file reflecting changes between releases, not between the commits).  Another convention is to call it a CHANGELOG.&lt;ref name="keepachangelog"/&gt; Some [[project maintainer]]s will append a ''.txt'' suffix to the file name if the changelog is [[plain text]], or a ''.md'' suffix if it is in [[Markdown]].

Some [[revision control]] systems are able to generate the relevant information that is suited as a changelog if the goal is to include all changes.

==Format==
Changelog files are organized by paragraphs, which define a unique change within a function or file.
The GNU Coding standards recommend the following format:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html |title=GNU Coding Standards: Style of Change Logs |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
YYYY-MM-DD  John Doe  &lt;johndoe@example.com&gt;

    * myfile.ext (myfunction): my changes made
    additional changes

    * myfile.ext (unrelated_change): my changes made
    to myfile.ext but completely unrelated to the above

    * anotherfile.ext (somefunction): more changes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that between the date and the name, and again between the name and the email address, there are two spaces each. It is common to enclose the email address in &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;. The [[Emacs | Emacs Editor]] creates such entries when creating additional changelog entries.

==Changelogs in Wikis==
Most [[Wiki]] software includes ''changelogs'' as a fundamental feature (often called ''history'' in this context). For example, the "View History" link at the top &lt;ref&gt;[[Help:Page_history]]&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Wikipedia]] entry links to that page's changelog. This feature is vital for complying with the attribution requirements of some copyright licenses.{{Citation needed|reason=This sentence needs a reliable source, how is the page history vital to this?|date=September 2017}}

==Product Changelogs==

A product changelog allows keeping customers in the loop about what's new. It helps to announce new features, latest releases, and relevant news directly in-app.

The concept of '''citizen journalism''' (also known as "'''public'''", "'''participatory'''", "'''democratic'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Baase|first = Sara|title =A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet |publisher =Prentice Hall|edition = 3rd |date = 2008|isbn = 9780136008484}}&lt;/ref&gt; "'''guerrilla'''"&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/9/5/5/8/p195585_index.html Recovering the Radical: Biocybernetic Subversion in Guerrilla Video Primer]." ''Paper presented at the NCA 93rd Annual Convention, Chicago, IL, November 14, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''street'''" '''journalism'''&lt;ref name="OpenDemocracy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Street journalists versus 'ailing journalists'?|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/street-journalists-as-an-answer-to-ailing-journalism|work=openDemocracy - free thinking for the world|publisher=openDemocracy Ltd|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Tamara Witschge|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is based upon public citizens "playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information."&lt;ref name="wemedia"&gt;Bowman, S. and Willis, C. "[http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php We Media: How Audiences are Shaping the Future of News and Information.]" 2003, ''The Media Center at the American Press Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Courtney C. Radsch]] defines citizen journalism "as an alternative and activist form of news gathering and reporting that functions outside mainstream media institutions, often as a response to shortcomings in the professional journalistic field, that uses similar journalistic practices but is driven by different objectives and ideals and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy than traditional or mainstream journalism".&lt;ref&gt;Radsch, Courtney C. The Revolutions will be Blogged: Cyberactivism and the 4th Estate in Egypt. Doctoral Dissertation, American University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Rosen]] proposes a simpler definition: "When the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Most Useful Definition of Citizen Journalism|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2008/07/14/a_most_useful_d.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Jay Rosen|date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizen journalism should not be confused with [[Community journalism]] or [[Civic journalism]], both of which are practiced by professional journalists; [[Collaborative journalism]] which is the practice of professional and non-professional journalists working together;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin, A.|first=Secko, D.|date=November 25, 2012|title=Debate Cited: A First Exploration of a Web Application to Enhance the Production of Science Journalism Students|url=http://cca.kingsjournalism.com/?p=171|journal=Journalism Interest Group, CCA/Groupe d'intérêt en journalisme, ACC Conference Proceedings|volume=2012|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 8, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social journalism]] that denotes a digital publication with a hybrid of professional and non-professional journalism.

Citizen journalism is a specific form of both [[citizen media]] and [[user-generated content]]. By juxtaposing the term "citizen", with its attendant qualities of civic-mindedness and social responsibility, with that of "journalism", which refers to a particular profession, [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argues that this term best describes this particular form of ''online'' and ''digital'' journalism conducted by amateurs, because it underscores the link between the practice of journalism and its relation to the political and public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch Karlekar|first1= Karin|last2=Radsch|first2= Courtney C.|title=Adapting Concepts of Media Freedom to a Changing Media Environment: Incorporating New Media and Citizen Journalism into the Freedom of the Press Index |date=July 1, 2012|journal= ESSACHESS Journal for Communication Studies|volume= 5| issue =  1, 2012|via=SSRN|url= http://ssrn.com/abstract=2161601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New media]] technology, such as [[Social media|social networking and media-sharing websites]], in addition to the increasing prevalence of cellular telephones, have made citizen journalism more accessible to people worldwide. Recent advances in new media have started to have a profound political impact.&lt;ref&gt;Gilardi, F. (2016). Digital Democracy. ''How Digital Democracy is Changing Democracy And Its Study.'', 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the availability of technology, citizens often can report breaking news more quickly than traditional media reporters. Notable examples of citizen journalism reporting from major world events are, the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[Arab Spring]], the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement, the [[2013 protests in Turkey]], the [[Euromaidan]] events in [[Ukraine]], and [[Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently|Syrian Civil War]] and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]].

Critics of the [[phenomenon]], including professional journalists and news organizations, claim that citizen journalism is unregulated, too [[Subjectivity|subjective]], amateur, and [[wikt:haphazard|haphazard]] in quality and coverage.

==Theory==
Citizen journalism, as a form of [[alternative media]], presents a "radical challenge to the professionalized and institutionalized practices of the mainstream media".&lt;ref&gt;Atton, Chris. 2003. What is "alternative journalism"? Journalism: Theory, Practice and Criticism 4, no. 3: 267-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Terry Flew, there have been three elements critical to the rise of citizen journalism: open publishing, collaborative editing, and distributed content.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry. 2005. ''New media: An introduction''. South Melbourne, Vic. ; New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Glaser, a [[freelance journalist]] who frequently writes on new media issues, said in 2006:&lt;ref name="glaser2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/09/your-guide-to-citizen-journalism270.html|title=Your Guide to Citizen Journalism|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]| author=Mark Glaser| date=September 27, 2006|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea behind citizen journalism is that people without professional journalism training can use the tools of modern technology and the global distribution of the Internet to create, augment or fact-check media on their own or in collaboration with others. For example, you might write about a city council meeting on your blog or in an online forum. Or you could fact-check a newspaper article from the mainstream media and point out factual errors or bias on your blog. Or you might snap a digital photo of a newsworthy event happening in your town and post it online. Or you might videotape a similar event and post it on a site such as YouTube. &lt;/blockquote&gt; The accessibility of online media has also enhanced the interest for journalism among youth and many websites, like 'Far and Wide' a publication focusing on travel and international culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farandwide.org/about/ |title=About — Far and Wide |publisher=Farandwide.org |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as WorldWeekly a news blog covering a range of topics from world politics to science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldweekly.net/about.html |title=About |publisher=WorldWeekly |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; are founded and run by students.

In ''What is Participatory Journalism?'',&lt;ref name="lasica"&gt;Lasica, J. D. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1060217106.php What is Participatory Journalism?]" 2003-08-07, ''Online Journalism Review'', August 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; J. D. Lasica classifies media for citizen journalism into the following types:

# Audience participation (such as user comments attached to news stories, personal blogs, photographs or video footage captured from personal [[Digital camera#Integration|mobile cameras]], or local news written by residents of a community)
# Independent news and information Websites ([[Consumer Reports]], the [[Drudge Report]])
# Full-fledged participatory news sites ([[one:convo]], [[NowPublic]], [[OhmyNews]], DigitalJournal.com, [[GroundReport]], 'Fair Observer')
# Collaborative and contributory media sites ([[Slashdot]], [[Kuro5hin]], [[Newsvine]])
# Other kinds of "thin media" (mailing lists, email newsletters)
# Personal broadcasting sites (video broadcast sites such as [[KenRadio]])

The literature of citizen, alternative, and participatory journalism is most often situated in a democratic context and theorized as a response to corporate news media dominated by an economic logic. Some scholars have sought to extend the study of citizen journalism beyond the Western, developed world, including Sylvia Moretzsohn,&lt;ref&gt;Moretzsohn, S. 2006. " Citizen journalism" and the myth of redemptive technology. Brazilian Journalism Research 2, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Courtney C. Radsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Radsch, C. (2011). Arab bloggers as citizen journalists (Transnational). In J. Downing (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of social movement media''. (pp. 62-65). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412979313.n31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clemencia Rodríguez]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Clemencia. 2001. Fissures in the mediascape : An international study of citizens' media. The Hampton Press Communication Series. Cresskill, N.J.: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Radsch, for example, wrote that "Throughout the Arab world, citizen journalists have emerged as the vanguard of new social movements dedicated to promoting human rights and democratic values."&lt;ref&gt;Radsch, C. (2011). Arab bloggers as citizen journalists (Transnational). In J. Downing (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of social movement media''. (pp. 62-65). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. P. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versus "grassroots media"===

One criticism of the term "citizen journalism" to describe this concept is that the word "citizen" has a conterminous relation to the nation-state. The fact that many millions of people are considered stateless and often, are without citizenship (such as refugees or immigrants without papers) limits the concept to those recognised only by governments. Additionally, the global nature of many participatory media initiatives, such as the [[Independent Media Center]], makes talking of journalism in relation to a particular nation-state largely redundant as its production and dissemination do not recognise national boundaries.
Some additional names given to the concept based on this analysis are, "grassroots media," "people's media," or "participatory media."

=== Theories of Citizenship ===
According to Vincent Campbell, theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups: those that consider journalism ''for'' citizenship and those that consider journalism ''as'' citizenship. The classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship. The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens. The classical model has 4 main characteristics: journalists' role of informing citizens; citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with; more informed citizens are more likely to participate; and the more informed citizens participate, the more democratic a state is more likely to be.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Vincent|date=2015|title=Theorizing Citizenship in Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|pages=704–719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first characteristic suggesting that the role of journalism is to inform citizens upholds the theory that journalism is ''for'' citizens. One of the main issues with this first theory is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be. One branch of journalism ''for'' citizens is the "monitorial citizen" coined by [[Michael Schudson]]. The "monitorial citizen" suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume. The "monitorial citizen" along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship. However, this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship, but instead an act of journalism. Therefore, citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens ''for'' citizenship and conversely, journalists serve citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second theory considers journalism ''as'' citizenship. This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship. The term "liquid citizenship" coined by [[Zizi Papacharissi]] depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations, which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic, political, and social. This "liquid citizenship" allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism. An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between "dutiful" citizens and "actualizing" citizens. "Dutiful" citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices, while "actualizing" citizens engage in non-traditional citizenship practices. This alternative approach suggests that "actualizing" citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and [[social media]] as sources of information, discussion, and participation. Thus, journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Relationship to local journalism==

Criticisms have been made against citizen journalism, especially from among professionals in the field. Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable, biased and untrained – as opposed to professionals who have "recognition, paid work, unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated, at least in the claim if not in the actuality".&lt;ref name="The Iranian Story: What Citizens? What Journalism? By Gholam Khiabany and Annabelle Sreberny"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=edited by Stuart|last2=Thorsen|first2=Einar|title=Citizen journalism : global perspectives|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433102950|pages=121|edition=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Citizen journalists gather material by being on the streets. Their tools can be narrowed down to a camera, social media and an instinct to start recording whenever something seems newsworthy or out of order. Much of their knowledge regarding the issues that are raised are obtained through their experience as a part of the community.

However, some major news reporting agencies, threatened by the speed with which news is reported and delivered by citizen journalism, have launched campaigns to bring in readers and financial support. For example, Bill Johnson, president of Embarcadero Media, which publishes several northern California newspapers, issued an online statement asking readers to subscribe to local newspapers in order to keep them financially solvent. Johnson put special emphasis on the critical role played by local newspapers, which, he argues, "reflect the values of the residents and businesses, challenge assumptions, and shine a light on our imperfections and aspirations."&lt;ref name="supportlocaljournalism"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.supportlocaljournalism.org/PaloAlto | title=Support Local Journalism | publisher=Embarcadero Media | accessdate=January 8, 2012 | author=Bill Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea that every citizen can engage in acts of journalism has a long history in the United States. The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]]. Those journalists became part of the public, or civic, journalism movement, which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs.&lt;ref name="merritt"&gt;Merritt, D. "[http://pjnet.org/post/318/ News Media must regain vigor, courage.]" September 29, 2004, ''PJNet Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvorkin"&gt;Dvorkin, J. A. "[https://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/010705.html Media Matters. Can Public Radio Journalism be Re-Invented?]" January 27, 2005, ''[[National Public Radio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;Meyer, E. P. "[http://www.unc.edu/%7Epmeyer/ire95pj.htm Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity.]" 1995, [http://www.unc.edu/%7Epmeyer/ Published on personal website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, discussions of public journalism focused on promoting journalism that was "for the people" by changing the way professional reporters did their work. According to Leonard Witt, however, early public journalism efforts were "often part of 'special projects' that were expensive, time-consuming, and episodic. Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on. [[Professional journalism|Professional journalists]] were driving the discussion. They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare-to-work (or the environment, or traffic problems, or the economy), and then they would recruit a cross-section of citizens and chronicle their points of view. Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism, and some outright opposed it, reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task." By 2003, in fact, the movement seemed to be petering out, with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors.

Traditionally, the term "citizen journalism" has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition. Even today, the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization. Although the term lacks conceptualization, alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon. For example, one of  the interchangeable names with "citizen journalism" is "[[user-generated content]]" (UGC). However, the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=Melissa|date=2015|title=Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|pages=797–813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With today's technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally. As [[Yochai Benkler]] has noted, "the capacity to make meaning – to encode and decode humanly meaningful statements – and the capacity to communicate one's meaning around the world, are held by, or readily available to, at least many hundreds of millions of users around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Part One: The Networked Information Economy|url=http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php?title=Text_Part_One |accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at [[Boston College]], notes in her article, ''Citizen Journalism and the Reporter's Privilege,'' that:&lt;ref&gt;Papandrea, Mary-Rose. "[http://lsr.nellco.org/bc/bclsfp/papers/167/ Citizen Journalism and the Reporter's Privilege]." ''[[Boston College|Boston College Law School]] (Minnesota Law Review, Vol. 91).'' 2007. Retrieved January 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

::[i]n many ways, the definition of "journalist" has now come full circle. When the First Amendment of the [[U.S. Constitution]] was adopted, "freedom of the press" referred quite literally to the freedom to publish using a printing press, rather than the freedom of organized entities engaged in the publishing business. The printers of 1775 did not exclusively publish newspapers; instead, in order to survive financially they dedicated most of their efforts printing materials for paying clients. The newspapers and pamphlets of the American Revolutionary era were predominantly partisan and became even more so through the turn of the century. They engaged in little news gathering and instead were predominantly vehicles for opinion.

::The passage of the term "journalism" into common usage in the 1830s occurred at roughly the same time that newspapers, using high speed rotary steam presses, began mass circulation throughout the eastern United States. Using the printing press, newspapers could distribute exact copies to large numbers of readers at a low incremental cost. In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for advertising for brand-name products fueled the creation of publications subsidized, in large part, by advertising revenue. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the concept of the "press" metamorphized into a description of individuals and companies engaged in an often-competitive commercial media enterprise.

==World Trade Organization (WTO)==

In 1999, activists in Seattle created a response to the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] meeting being held there. These activists understood the only way they could get into the [[corporate media]] was by blocking the streets. Then they realized that a scant 60 seconds of coverage would show them being carted off by the police, but without any context to explain why they were protesting. They knew they had to create an alternative media model.

Since then, the [[Indymedia]] movement has experienced exponential growth, and [[Independent Media Center|IMCs]] have been created in more than 200 cities all over the world.

Simultaneously, journalism "by the people" began to flourish, enabled by emerging internet and networking technologies, such as [[Blog|weblogs]], [[chat rooms]], [[message boards]], [[wiki]]s, and [[mobile computing]]. A relatively new development is the use of convergent polls, allowing editorials and opinions to be submitted and voted on. Over time, the poll converges on the most broadly accepted editorials and opinions. In South Korea, [[OhmyNews]] became popular and commercially successful with the motto, "Every Citizen is a Reporter." Founded by [[Oh Yeon Ho|Oh Yeon-ho]] on February 22, 2000, it has a staff of 40 or more traditional reporters and editors who write about 20% of its content, with the rest coming from other freelance contributors who mostly are ordinary citizens. OhmyNews now has an estimated 50,000 contributors, and has been credited with transforming South Korea's conservative political environment.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], both the Democratic and Republican parties issued press credentials to citizen bloggers covering the convention, marking a new level of influence and credibility for nontraditional journalists. Some bloggers{{Who|date=September 2010}} also began "watchdogging" the work of conventional journalists, monitoring their work for biases and inaccuracy.

A recent trend in citizen journalism has been the emergence of what blogger [[Jeff Jarvis]] terms [[hyperlocal journalism]], as online news sites invite contributions from local residents of their subscription areas, who often report on topics that conventional newspapers tend to ignore.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, L. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46519-2004Dec8.html On Local Sites, Everyone's A Journalist], December 9, 2004, ''The Washington Post'', E1.&lt;/ref&gt; "We are the traditional journalism model turned upside down," explains Mary Lou Fulton, the publisher of the Northwest Voice in [[Bakersfield, California]]. "Instead of being the gatekeeper, telling people that what's important to them 'isn't news', we're just opening up the gates and letting people come on in. We are a better community newspaper for having thousands of readers who serve as the eyes and ears for the Voice, rather than having everything filtered through the views of a small group of reporters and editors."&lt;ref name="glaser"&gt;Glaser, M.

In June 2009, hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran, to [[2009–10 Iranian election protests|protest the election outcome]].

==Citizen journalists==
According to [[Jay Rosen]], citizen journalists are "the people formerly known as the audience," who "''were'' on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern, with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another— and who ''today'' are not in a situation like that ''at all''. ... The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer, less fictional, more able, less predictable."&lt;ref name="rosen2006"&gt;Rosen, Jay "[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html#more The People Formerly Known as the Audience]," PressThink, June 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microblog]] Twitter played an important role during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]], after foreign journalists had effectively been "barred from reporting". Twitter delayed scheduled maintenance during the protests that would have shut down coverage in Iran due to the role it played in public communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/middleeast/17media.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology Washington Taps Into a Potent New Force in Diplomacy] ''[[The New York Times]]'' June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, individually produced citizen journalism exists in the form of [[social media]] platforms such as [[blogs]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]]. These social media platforms encourage and facilitate engagement with other citizens who participate in creating content through commenting, liking, linking, and sharing. This practice is considered to be the 21st century version of individualized citizen journalism. The first wave of this type of citizen journalism came about in the form of amateur news bloggers. These bloggers often created content and narrative that challenged and critiqued the mainstream news outlets. The majority of the content produced by these amateur news bloggers was not actually original content, but curated information that was primarily monitored and edited by these various bloggers. However, recently there has been a decline in the amateur news blogger due to social media platforms that are much easier to run and maintain. These social media platforms allow individuals to easily share and create and content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Objectivity===

Citizen journalists also may be activists within the communities they write about. This has drawn some criticism from traditional media institutions such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', which have accused proponents of public journalism of abandoning the traditional goal of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]. Many traditional journalists view citizen journalism with some skepticism, believing that only trained journalists can understand the exactitude and ethics involved in reporting news. See, e.g., [[Nicholas Lemann]], Vincent Maher, and Tom Grubisich.

An academic paper by Vincent Maher, the head of the New Media Lab at Rhodes University, outlined several weaknesses in the claims made by citizen journalists, in terms of the "three deadly E's", referring to ethics, economics, and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name="maher"&gt;Maher, V. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060924125946/http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=6 Citizen Journalism is Dead.]" 2005, New Media Lab, School of Journalism &amp; Media Studies, Rhodes University, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by language and linguistics professor, Patricia Bou-Franch, found that some citizen journalists resorted to abuse-sustaining discourses naturalizing violence against women. She found that these discourses were then challenged by others who questioned the gendered ideologies of male violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bou-Franch | first1 = Patricia | title = Domestic violence and public participation in the media: The case of citizen journalism | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–302 | publisher = [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox]] | doi = 10.1558/genl.v7i3.275 | year = 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1558/genl.v7i3.275 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality===

An article in 2005 by Tom Grubisich reviewed ten new citizen journalism sites and found many of them lacking in quality and content.&lt;ref name="grubisich"&gt;Grubisich, T. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/051006/ Grassroots journalism: Actual content vs. shining ideal.]" October 6, 2005, ''USC Annenberg, Online Journalism Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Grubisich followed up a year later with, "Potemkin Village Redux."&lt;ref name="grubisich2006"&gt;Grubisich, T. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/Grubisich061911/ Potemkin Village Redux.]" November 19, 2006, ''USC Annenberg, Online Journalism Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the best sites had improved editorially and were even nearing profitability, but only by not expensing editorial costs. Also according to the article, the sites with the weakest editorial content were able to expand aggressively because they had stronger financial resources.

Another article published on Pressthink examined Backfence, a citizen journalism site with three initial locations in the D.C. area, which reveals that the site has only attracted limited citizen contributions.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;George, E. "[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/11/30/lz_bcfc.html Guest Writer Liz George of Baristanet Reviews Backfence.com Seven Months After Launch.]" November 30, 2005, ''Pressthink''.&lt;/ref&gt; The author concludes that, "in fact, clicking through Backfence's pages feels like frontier land -– remote, often lonely, zoned for people but not home to any. The site recently launched for [[Arlington, Virginia]]. However, without more settlers, Backfence may wind up creating more ghost towns."

[[David Simon]], a former [[Baltimore Sun]] reporter and writer-producer of the popular television series, "[[The Wire]]," criticized the concept of citizen journalism—claiming that unpaid bloggers who write as a hobby cannot replace trained, professional, seasoned journalists.
{{quote|"I am offended to think that anyone, anywhere believes American institutions as insulated, self-preserving and self-justifying as police departments, school systems, legislatures and chief executives can be held to gathered facts by amateurs pursuing the task without compensation, training or for that matter, sufficient standing to make public officials even care to whom it is they are lying to."}}

An editorial published by ''The Digital Journalist'' web magazine expressed a similar position, advocating to abolish the term "citizen journalist", and replacing it with "citizen news gatherer".
{{quote|"Professional journalists cover fires, floods, crime, the legislature, and the White House every day. There is either a fire line or police line, or security, or the Secret Service who allow them to pass upon displaying credentials vetted by the departments or agencies concerned. A citizen journalist, an amateur, will always be on the outside of those lines. Imagine the White House throwing open its gates to admit everybody with a camera phone to a presidential event."&lt;ref name="letsabolishcitizenjournalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0912/lets-abolish-citizen-journalists.html|title=Let's abolish the term 'Citizen Journalists'|date=December 2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the fact that citizen journalists can report in real time and are not subject to oversight opens them to criticism about the accuracy of their reporting, news stories presented by mainstream media also misreport facts occasionally that are reported correctly by citizen journalists. As low as 32% of the American population have a fair amount of trust in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx|title=Americans' Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low|last=Inc|first=Gallup|website=Gallup.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on traditional journalism ===
Journalism has been affected significantly due to citizen journalism. This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want, whenever they want. In order to stay competitive, traditional news sources are forcing their journalist to compete. This means that journalist now have to write, edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace, as it is perceived by news companies that it's essential for journalist to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet. This is hard though, as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do.  Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a 35% increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to [[Astra Taylor]] in her book [[The People's Platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador Paperback|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal repercussions===

Edward Greenberg, a New York City litigator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecopyrightzone.com/?page_id=9|title=About Ed|author=Edward Greenberg |accessdate= 17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones:
{{quote|"So-called shield laws, which protect reporters from revealing sources, vary from state to state. On occasion, the protection is dependent on whether the person [who] asserted the claim is in fact a journalist. There are many cases at both the state and federal levels where judges determine just who is/is not a journalist. Cases involving libel often hinge on whether the actor was or was not a member of the "press"."&lt;ref name="letsabolishcitizenjournalism"/&gt;}}

The view stated above does not mean that professional journalists are fully protected by shield laws. In the 1972 [[Branzburg v. Hayes]] case the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] invalidated the use of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a [[grand jury]]. In 2005, the [[Reporters' Privilege#Judith Miller brings reporters' privilege to the forefront of media attention|reporter's privilege]] of [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] was rejected by the appellate court.

== Possible future ==
Citizen journalism has largely increased during the last decade of the twentieth century and throughout the twenty-first century. This rise of participation can be associated with the creation of the [[internet]] which introduced new ways in communicating and engaging news. Due to this shift in technology, individuals were able to access more news than previously and at a much faster rate. This larger quantity also made it so there was a larger variety of sources which people were able to consume media and news.

Natalie Fenton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/sfu/reader.action?docID=10349689|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|author=|date=|website=site.ebrary.com|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the role of citizen journalism within the [[Digital Age|digital age]] and has three characteristics associated with the topic: speed and space, multiplicity and poly-centrality and interactivity and participation. These characteristics were due to the invention of the internet, which, made way for amateur and citizen journalist to make a name for themselves within the industry. This was happening throughout the 1990s, however, once the [[2000s (decade)|mid 2000s]] began, the introduction of technologies such as the [[smartphone]] increased the ability to access the internet and made it so that individuals were able to use it globally and on the go. With these technological advancements, individuals were able to participate in journalism, like never before. Pictures or videos could be uploaded online in a matter of minutes and this paved the way for [[social media]] to grow as a strong producer in the industry.

In 2017, there are a number of different social media platforms through which people can access for their news. Many large corporations have even started to shift their focus onto internet sites, such as Facebook or YouTube and this has also made it easier for the existence of Alternative Media groups to exist. This transition into a digital realm of media has created many new possibilities for people to participate in journalism and it is due to the technological advancements such as the internet and [[smartphone]]s.

As society continues to move forward in a [[Digital Age|digital age]] new possibilities in the realm of technology emerge and can be associated with the journalism industry. New devices such as [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]], open new avenues, which media companies and people will be able to participate with journalism. As society continues to move towards embracing technology as part of their lives, citizen journalism should increase in accessibility and participation.

==Proponents and facilitators==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Dan Gillmor]], the former technology columnist for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', is one of the foremost proponents{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} of citizen journalism and founded a nonprofit, the Center for Citizen Media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citmedia.org/ |title=Center for Citizen Media |publisher=Center for Citizen Media Blog |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help promote it.

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s French-language television network also has organized a weekly public affairs program called, "5 sur 5", which has been organizing and promoting citizen-based journalism since 2001.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On the program, viewers submit questions on a wide variety of topics, and they, accompanied by staff journalists, get to interview experts to obtain answers to their questions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Jay Rosen]], a journalism professor at New York University, was one of public journalism's earliest proponents.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} From 1993 to 1997, he directed the ''Project on Public Life and the Press'', funded by the [[Knight Foundation]] and housed at NYU.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He also currently runs the PressThink weblog.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Professor [[Charles Nesson]], William F. Weld Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the founder of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, chairs the Advisory Board for Jamaican citizen journalism startup [[On the Ground News Reports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Ground News Reports (OGNR) the Citizen Powered News Network officially launched at Kingston BETA|url=http://kingstonbeta.com/2013/07/11/on-the-ground-news-report-ognr-the-citizen-powered-news-network-officially-launched-at-kingston-beta/|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading proponents{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} for citizen journalism in Australia is [[Margo Kingston]], author and former political journalist for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Kingston launched one of the world's first mainstream citizen journalism platforms, Webdiary, in 2000, well before ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Kingston resigned from Webdiary in 2005 but the site continues and has been preserved in Pandora, Australia's National Web Archive.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After a period of retirement, Kingston returned to citizen journalism in 2013 by co-publishing a new site [[No Fibs]]. It was on this site that Kingston published an exclusive story that the Australian Prime Minister, [[Tony Abbott]], had inappropriately claimed expenses for promoting his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margo |last=Kingston |title=NoFibs|url=http://nofibs.com.au/2013/07/06/exclusive-abbott-forced-to-repay-taxpayers-9400-he-charged-taxpayers-to-promote-his-book/|publisher=nofibs.com.au|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, blogger and novelist [[James Wesley Rawles]] launched a web site that provides free press credentials for citizen journalists called the Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA).&lt;ref name="blogs.spjnetwork.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/tech/2014/05/23/survivalist-starts-issuing-his-own-press-passes/|title=Survivalist starts issuing his own press passes - A Society of Professional Journalists Blog|work=Net Worked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CFAPA.org|title=Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA) Free Press Credentials (Free Press Pass)  - An Independent Press Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Sheets of the [[Society for Professional Journalists]], Rawles keeps no records on who gets these credentials.&lt;ref name="blogs.spjnetwork.org"/&gt;

Maurice Ali, a citizen journalist from Canada, founded one of the first international citizen journalist associations called the [[International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.]]  (IAIJ) in 2003. The association through its President (Maurice Ali) have published studies and articles on citizen journalism, attended and spoken at UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Citizen Journalism' |pages=|publisher=UNESCO |date=February 27, 2013|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/news/30_citizen_journalism.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United Nations events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='WSIS+10 United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting' |pages=|publisher=United Nations |date=July 2, 2015|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/wsis10/2julystakeholderconsultation|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Maurice Ali Speech: International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.

The typical duration of a vinyl album is about 15 to 25 minutes per side. Classical music and spoken word recordings can extend to over 30 minutes on a side.  If a side exceeds the average time, the maximum groove amplitude is reduced to make room for the additional program material.  This can cause hiss in the sound from lower quality amplifiers when the volume is turned up to compensate for the lower recorded level.  An extreme example, [[Todd Rundgren]]'s  ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' LP, with 36 minutes of music on one side, has a "technical note" at the bottom of the inner sleeve: "if the sound does not seem loud enough on your system, try re-recording the music onto tape." The total of around 40&amp;ndash;45 minutes often influences the arrangement of tracks, with the preferred positions being the opening and closing tracks of each side.

Although the term [[extended play|EP]] is commonly used to describe a 7" single with more than two tracks, technically they are not different from a normal 7" single. The EP uses reduced dynamic range and a smaller run-off groove area to extend the playing time. However, there are examples of singles, such as [[The Beatles]]' "[[Hey Jude]]" or [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", which are six minutes long or more. (in 1989, RCA released 'Dreamtime' by the band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], which clocks at 8:40). These longer recordings would require the same technical approach as an EP. The term EP has also been used for 10" 45 rpm records, typically containing a reduced number of tracks.

Vinyl albums have a large 12" (30 cm) [[album cover]], which also allows cover designers scope for imaginative designs, often including fold-outs and leaflets.

===Sturmgewehr 44===
[[Image:MP44.jpg|thumb|left|The German Sturmgewehr 44]]

The Germans were the first to pioneer the [[assault rifle]] concept, during World War II, based upon research that showed that most firefights happen within 400 meters and that contemporary rifles were over-powered for most small arms combat.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/a-brief-history-of-the-assault-rifle/489428/ The Atlantic.

Originally known as the MP 43 (Machine Pistol) for Nazi political reasons, it was renamed the "Sturmgewehr 44" after its successful introduction into battle on the Eastern Front. It introduced the concept of using a short cartridge with limited range in order to permit controllable automatic fire and a compact weapon, and because experience showed that most rifle fire was conducted at ranges under 400 meters. After the war it was examined and dissected by almost every major gunmaking nation and led, in one way and another, to the present-day 5.56mm assault rifles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lone Sentry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Machine Carbine Promoted: MP43 Is Now Assault Rifle StG44, WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945 |publisher=Lone Sentry |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Century p.243"&gt;Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

The Sturmgewehr 44 features an inexpensive, easy-to-make, stamped steel design and a 30-round detachable box magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''Military Small Arms of the 20th Century''. 7th Edition. Ian V. Hogg &amp; John S. Weeks. Krause Publications. 2000. page 242–243&lt;/ref&gt; "This weapon was the prototype of all successful automatic rifles. Characteristically (and unlike previous rifles and the M-14) it had a straight stock with the barrel under the gas cylinder to reduce the turning moment of recoil of the rifle in the shoulder and thus help reduce the tendency of shots to climb in automatic fire. The barrel and overall length were shorter than a traditional rifle and it had a pistol grip to hold the weapon more securely in automatic fire. The principle of this weapon — the reduction of muzzle impulse to get usable automatic fire within the actual ranges of combat — was probably the most important advance in small arms since the invention of smokeless powder."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===AK-47===

Like the Germans, the Soviets were influenced by experience showing most combat happens within 400 meters and that their soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] assault rifles.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2006"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400788.html Weapon Of Mass Destruction].

They copied the ballistics of the cartridge while improving the configuration and improving the weapon. They standardized the weapon in 1947 as the AK-47 rifle."&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 1943, a Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the [[People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR]].&lt;ref name="english.pravda.ru"&gt;http://english.pravda.ru/history/02-08-2003/3461-kalashnikov-0/ "The history of the world-known gun started on July 15th, 1943, when a captured complex—an MP-43 gun and a cartridge—were demonstrated at a meeting of the arms committee.

Kalashnikov, by then a sergeant, was injured within months when a shell stopped his T-34 tank and sent shrapnel through his shoulder. As Soviet history tells it, while Sgt. Kalashnikov recuperated, he began tinkering with infantry weapons, eventually setting his mind on designing a lightweight automatic assault rifle that would expel the better-armed Nazis from Russian soil. Soviet infantry fought World War II with two basic small arms: one was the badly outdated Mosin–Nagant Model 1891 bolt-action rifle. The other was the PPSh series of submachine guns, reliable arms that were effective but only at short range. Something better was needed, and that something was in the hands of the Nazi Wehrmacht. It was called the MP44 Sturmgewehr (assault rifle), and it could fire in full or semiautomatic mode. Chambered for a revolutionary new cartridge, a short 7.92mm round that was less powerful than a full-size rifle cartridge, yet far more powerful than the pistol cartridges for which submachine guns were chambered, the Sturmgewehr made a deep impression on the Soviets who faced it." The Father of 100 Million Rifles Mikhail Kalashnikov was a poor russian farm boy who happened to be a mechanical genius, and for better or for worse, the rifle he designed has changed history.

Hallock, Colonel (retired) of US Army [http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/09/02.pdf M16 Case Study] March 16, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. Army studies of World War II combat accounts had very similar results to that of the Germans and Soviets, the U.S. Army failed to recognize the importance of the assault rifle concept,&lt;ref name="M16 Rifle Case Study 1970"/&gt; and instead maintained its traditional views and preference for high-powered semi-automatic rifles.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M16 Rifle Case Study 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="american_rifle"/&gt; At the time, the U.S. Army believed that the Sturmgewehr 44 was "intended in a general way to serve the same purpose as the U.S. carbine" and was in many ways inferior to the M1 carbine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html Machine Carbine Promoted, M.P. 43 Is Now "Assault Rifle 44", ''Tactical and Technical Trends'', No. 57, April 1945, U.S. Military Intelligence Service, U.S. War Department publication&lt;/ref&gt;  and was of "little importance".&lt;ref name="M16 Rifle Case Study 1970"/&gt;

After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the [[M1 Garand]], [[M1 carbine|M1/M2 Carbines]], [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]], [[M3 submachine gun|M3 "Grease Gun"]] and [[Thompson submachine gun]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The M16.

The United States Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1 Garand. Springfield Armory's T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the Garand chambered for the new 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48. [[ArmaLite]] entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting several [[AR-10]] prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the United States Army's Springfield Armory for testing.&lt;ref name="Pikula36, 38"&gt;Pikula, pp. 36, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AR-10 in the National Firearms Museum.jpg|thumb|AR-10 rifle]]

===M16 rifle===

The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the [[Vietnam War]]. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallarmsreview.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Emerson [http://www.imageseek.com/m1a/M14_RHAD_Online_Edition_061010.pdf M14 Rifle History and Development]. October 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; And, while the M2 Carbine offered a high rate of fire, it was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the AK-47.&lt;ref&gt;Green Beret in Vietnam: 1957-73. Gordon Rottman. Osprey Publishing, 2002. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement was needed: A medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine.

As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56&amp;nbsp;mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6&amp;nbsp;lbs (2.7&amp;nbsp;kg) when loaded with a 20-round magazine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. [[helmet]] at 500 yards (460 meters) and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Robert (ed.), ''The .223'', Guns &amp; Ammo Annual Edition, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the [[Armalite AR-10]], called [[ArmaLite AR-15]] rifle.&lt;ref name="m-14parts.com"&gt;Danford Allan Kern [http://www.m-14parts.com/M14toM16.pdf The influence of organizational culture on the acquisition of the m16 rifle]. m-14parts.com.

[[File:AK-47 and M16 DM-SN-82-07699.JPEG|thumb|right|A U.S. M16A1 rifle (top) is compared to a Soviet AKMS rifle. The two rifles are disassembled into groups.]]
The AK-47 is a select-fire, 7.62×39mm, air-cooled, long-stroke-piston gas-operated, magazine-fed rifle, with a rotating bolt. It was designed to be a simple, reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the [[Soviet Union]] during the late 1940s. The AK-47's barrel and bolt were milled out of a [[Bar stock|steel billet]] and [[hard chromed]]. Its [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] was originally designed to be stamped from sheet metal with a milled trunnion insert. However, there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production causing high rejection rates due to faulty receivers.&lt;ref name="Their Variations 2006. pages 8-11"&gt;''The AK-47 and AK-74 Kalashnikov Rifles and Their Variations: A Shooter's and Collector's Guide''. by Joe Poyer. North Cape Publications. 2006. pages 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of halting production, a heavy forged steel machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver.&lt;ref name="Their Variations 2006. pages 8-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdn1.usmcofficer.com"&gt;http://cdn1.usmcofficer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enemy-Threat-Weapons.pdf{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Enemy Threat Weapons B2A2177 Student Handout/Self Paced Instruction, United States Marine Corps, The Basic School, Marine Corps Training Command, Camp Barrett, Virginia 22134-5019, Basic Officer Course&lt;/ref&gt; This was a more costly and time consuming process, but advanced the program's development and accelerated production.&lt;ref name="Their Variations 2006. pages 8-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdn1.usmcofficer.com"/&gt;  The AK's furniture was simply made out of wood, which was a non-strategic material, and perfectly fits the Soviet manufacturing philosophy, where large manufacturing plants produce basic weapons in very large quantities.

In 1959, the sheet metal stamping process was perfected, simplifying production and reducing the weight of the rifle from {{convert|3.87|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2.93|kg|lb|abbr=on}} without magazine.&lt;ref name="Dockery 2007 101-103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dockery|first=Kevin|title=Future Weapons|year=2007|pages=101–103|isbn=0-425-21750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the AK type rifles in use today are of this lighter stamped-steel [[AKM]] variety. Over time, AK production has been simplified through the use of rivets,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/35165946/Ak-47-Technical-Manual AK-47 Technical Manual&lt;/ref&gt; spot welding and by further reducing the number of machined parts.&lt;ref name="keyforensic.co.uk"&gt;http://www.keyforensic.co.uk/docs/2013_45_3_222_Kabbani.pdf ''AFTE Journal'', Volume 45 Number 3, Summer 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the milled-steel AK-47 has spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured (one gun at a time) in small shops around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Soliman M.

===Ergonomics===
"The AR-15/M16-series rifles are considered the finest human-engineered assault rifles in the world."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gundigest.com/article/the-ar-16m16-the-rifle-that-was-never-supposed-to-be Gun Digest Book of Classic Combat Rifles. AR-15/M16: The Rifle That Was Never Supposed to Be.
By: Christopher R. Bartocci. July 16, 2012 "The AR-15 made use of high-impact fibrite stocks, pistol grips and handguards. A selector lever on the left side of the rifle could be manipulated with the shooter’s right thumb without removing the hand from the pistol grip. The magazine release, on the right side of the receiver, could be operated with the trigger finger; when pressed, the magazine would drop free.

A fresh magazine, requiring no camming — or ‘rocking’ — could be inserted straight into the magazine well. This attribute contributed significantly to speedy reloading in combat situations compared to its closest rival, the AK-47/AKM. These are two of the main reasons why the AR-15/M16-series rifles are considered the finest human-engineered assault rifles in the world.

A bolt catch mechanism is located on the left side of the rifle. When the last round was fired, the magazine follower would elevate the bolt catch and lock the bolt to the rear. After inserting a full magazine, the rifleman would push in on the upper portion of the bolt catch to release the bolt and load the rifle. The receivers, produced from 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum, which helps keep the rifle lightweight and dissipates heat better than conventional metals, are hard-anodized with a non-reflective matte gray weather-resistant finish.&lt;/ref&gt; The M16 is ergonomically superior to the AK-47 in most respects.&lt;ref name="The AK-47 Patrol Rifle"&gt;"The AK-47 Patrol Rifle." by Scott Oldham. ''Tactical Response''. September/October 2008 "Both weapons were then subjected to a "limited" endurance test by firing six magazines as fast as they could be loaded into the weapon; this was to mimic what would be the worst-case patrol usage. As expected, neither weapon exhibited any problems, feeding and firing every round without issue. It was, however, during this portion of the test that one of the AR system’s true advantages came into sharp focus—superior ergonomics.

The AR-15 is without a doubt one of the most ergonomic weapon designs to ever be fielded in large numbers. During the six magazine endurance test, which admittedly was not a true endurance test but rather a proof of ability test, all evaluators found that it was much easier to change magazines and get the weapon back into action quickly with the AR-15 design than with the AK-47 design.

This enhanced performance was due to several factors, not the least of which is the ability to simply insert the magazine into the AR in a conventional manner rather than the "rock and lock" method required with the AK platform. Also noted here was ability of the AR users to leave their strong hand on the weapon and in control while performing magazine changes and charging the weapon. Users of the AK found that while some people are capable of doing so, this was a much more cumbersome operation with this platform than with the AR design.

Also in the realm of ergonomics is the placement of the manual safety. With the AR, this is a very well designed lever located on the left side of the weapon that is capable of being manipulated with the thumb of the strong hand while still retaining a grip on the weapon. With the AK—on most variants—the safety is a large lever on the right side of the weapon that is not at all easy to manipulate. With most people, the strong hand must come completely out of the firing grip to either apply or disengage the safety.

Both weapon designs have been thoroughly tested in every climate on the planet and have proven themselves in combat for the past three and a half decades—so further, "endurance" testing would be pointless. What this test did is allow for the weapons to get extremely hot and provided for the operators to judge the now-hot weapon based on how well they could use it without gloved hands. In each case, both weapons were judged to be very usable but the AR clearly got the nod as the most desirable weapon. This again was due to the ergonomic placement of controls, which keeps the hands away from any part of the weapon that is susceptible to heat transfer."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tact&gt;http://www.tactical-life.com/magazines/special-weapons/in-praise-of-the-m16-rifle/?scrape=true Tactical Life.

Frisbee Jr. "When you reload an M-16 the bolt locks to the rear which helps the shooter realize his magazine is empty. After removing the previous magazine and inserting the new one you still have to release the bolt before you can fire (a simple operation really). The AK-47 and other similar weapons have the bolt go home. This can be confusing for the shooter because it could indicate a jam or empty magazine. After removing the magazine and attaching the new one the AK gunner has to pull the charging handle to the rear in order to put a round in the chamber. This method is much slower than an M16 and in the confusion can be easier to fumble.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is easier for an M16 user to keep the strong hand on the pistol-grip and sights on target while performing magazine changes than with the AK-47.&lt;ref name="The AK-47 Patrol Rifle"/&gt;

!colspan=2|Fire selector
|- valign=top
|The fire selector is located on the left side of the rifle just above the pistol grip and is rotated by the shooter's right thumb. When the selector points forward = safe, up = semi-auto and backward = full-auto or burst. To use, the selector is rotated 90 degrees clockwise (down and forward) into the semi-auto position and then rotated an additional 90 degrees clockwise (forward and up) into the full-auto or burst position. To return to safe the selector is then rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise (down, backward and up). Some M16 type rifles also have an ambidextrous fire selector on the right side of the receiver, designed to be operated by a left-handed shooter's thumb. This selector mirrors its opposite and functions as describe above.
|The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle; it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and it has 3 settings: up = safe, center = full-auto and down = semi-auto. The reason for this is that, when under stress, a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever.&lt;ref name="arsenalinc1"/&gt; Some AK-47 type rifles also have a small vertical selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip.&lt;ref name="arsenalinc1"&gt;{{citation |first=Peter G. |last=Kokalis |title=Kalashnikovs - 3 of the best: Born in Bulgaria, Made in the USA |url=http://www.arsenalinc.com/usa/imgs/articles/BulgarianAK.pdf |journal=Shotgun News |volume=59 |issue=12 |date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: forward = safe, center = full-auto and backwards = semi-auto.&lt;ref name="arsenalinc1"/&gt;

===Recoil===
With the proper mind-set, training and practice, soldiers armed with both the AK-47 and M16 are quite deadly. However, the M16's direct impingement gas operation system, straight-line recoil design and smaller caliber give it less [[recoil]] than the AK-47 and makes it easier to control in full-auto.&lt;ref name="SAOW2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ezell |first=Edward Clinton |title=Small Arms of the World|year=1983|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=New York |isbn=978-0-88029-601-4|pages=746–762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The (M16's) Stoner system provides a very symmetric design that allows straight line movement of the operating components. This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole."&lt;ref name=:54/&gt; The M16's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action,&lt;ref name="SAOW2"/&gt; and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.&lt;ref name="SAOW2"/&gt; The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. Also, current model M16 flash-suppressors also act as compensators to reduce recoil further.&lt;ref name="quarterbore.com"&gt;http://quarterbore.com/library/pdf_files/tm43-0001-27.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | Operator's Manual, Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2 W/E (1005-01128-9936) August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

With the AK-47's [[Gas-operated reloading|long-stroke piston gas system]], the piston is mechanically fixed to the bolt group and moves through the entire operating cycle. The primary disadvantage to this system is the disruption of the point of aim due to the center of mass changing during the action cycle and energetic and abrupt stops at the beginning and end of bolt carrier travel. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job of mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a  [[Muzzle brake|muzzle brake or compensator]] to reduce recoil.&lt;ref name="ak103"/&gt; Some AK type rifles also have [[Foregrip|vertical foregrips]] to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of [[recoil]].&lt;ref name="Jane's Guns Recognition Guide 2005. p 308-309"&gt;''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

===Sights===
"A longer rifle barrel has the advantages of a longer sight radius, theoretically allowing a shooter to obtain a higher degree of accuracy from the improved precision of the sights alone. A longer barrel also provides a longer path for the projectile to stabilize prior to exiting the barrel, while allotting a longer period of time for the propellant charge to act on the projectile, often resulting in higher muzzle velocities and more consistent trajectories. A long barrel inherently provides more mass available for heat transfer, increasing the heat transfer rate incurred between shots, in turn allotting less warpage in the barrel, helping to improve consistency (and ultimately accuracy)."&lt;ref&gt;https://honors.usf.edu/documents/Thesis/U82488180.pdf Effect of Barrel Length on the Muzzle Velocity and Report from a Mosin-Nagant 7.62x54R Rifle, Brandon Louis Clark, Honors College, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida USA, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range and accuracy===
A brief comparison between cartridges reveals that the M16's lighter, higher-velocity [[5.56×45mm]] cartridge has much better range and accuracy than the AK-47's heavier [[7.62×39mm]] cartridge.&lt;ref name="american_rifle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GX. The Guard Experience. The Pride of the Guard. by Major Darrin Haas. Volume 10. Issue 3. 2013. Page 67. "Although the AK-47 is an extremely rugged and reliable weapon, it’s less accurate and has a less effective range than the M16."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;http://www.tactical-life.com/magazines/special-weapons/in-praise-of-the-m16-rifle/?scrape=true Tactical Life. In Praise of the M16 Rifle. Why it's become the longest serving rifle in the recent US military history! By Chuck Taylor. June 13th 2009 "From an accuracy standpoint, there is no comparison between the M16 and AK. As long as the upper and lower receivers are tight and the trigger is halfway decent, the M16 is capable of MOA accuracy, whereas a typical AK will produce 5 to 6 MOA at best. And, if a free-floated barrel is incorporated to the M16's design, it becomes capable of ½-MOA or better, making it fully as accurate as a finely tuned heavy-barreled bolt-action precision rifle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, the U.S. Army would hold long-range firing tests with Kalashnikov variants, including three Soviet, two Chinese, and a Romanian model. At 300 meters, expert shooters at prone or bench rest positions had difficulty putting ten consecutive rounds on target. The testers then had the weapons fired from a cradle by a machine, which removed human error. At 300 meters, the ten-rounds group fired in this manner had a minimum dispersion of 17.5 inches, compared to the 12.6 inches with an M-16, the American assault rifle fielded in Vietnam as a reaction to the Kalashnikov's spread."&lt;/ref&gt;

June 13th 2009 "From an accuracy standpoint, there is no comparison between the M16 and AK. As long as the upper and lower receivers are tight and the trigger is halfway decent, the M16 is capable of MOA accuracy, whereas a typical AK will produce 5 to 6 MOA at best. And, if a free-floated barrel is incorporated to the M16’s design, it becomes capable of ½-MOA or better, making it fully as accurate as a finely tuned heavy-barreled bolt-action precision rifle."&lt;/ref&gt; "In Fallujah, Marines with [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]]-equipped M16A4s created a stir by taking so many head shots that until the wounds were closely examined, some observers thought the insurgents had been executed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Combat Arms |title=Iraq: Lessons From The Sandbox |first=Richard |last=Venola |issn=0810-8838}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest M855A1 EPR cartridge is even more accurate and during testing "...has shown that, on average, 95 percent of the rounds will hit within an 8 × 8-inch target at 600 meters."&lt;ref name="pica.army.mil"&gt;http://www.pica.army.mil/picatinnypublic/news/images/highlights/2011/M855A1/32_The_Evolution_of_the_M855A1_5.56mm_Enhanced_Performance_Round,%201960-2010.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053818/http://www.pica.army.mil/picatinnypublic/news/images/highlights/2011/M855A1/32_The_Evolution_of_the_M855A1_5.56mm_Enhanced_Performance_Round%2C%201960-2010.pdf |date=2013-09-21 }} ARMY AL&amp;T.

The AK-47's heavier 7.62×39mm round has superior penetration when compared to the M16's lighter 5.56×45mm round and is better in circumstances where a soldier has to shoot through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62×39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment in soft tissue&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt; and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone.

The original ammunition for the M16 was the 5.56×45mm M193 round. When fired from a 20" barrel at ranges of up to 100 meters, the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above 2900&amp;nbsp;ft/s) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber.&lt;ref name="ammo.ar15.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt; These wounds were much larger than those produced by AK-47 and they were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian V.

In March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all [[NATO]] forces adopt the [[5.56×45mm]] cartridge.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the mid 1970s, other armies were looking at M16-style weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The U.S. offered the 5.56×45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of [[ballistic vest|body armor]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the end the Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 round was chosen ([[STANAG]] 4172) in October 1980.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Due to its design and lower muzzle velocity (about 3110&amp;nbsp;ft/s)&lt;ref name="archivemil"/&gt; the Belgian SS109 round is considered more humane because it is less likely to fragment than the U.S. M193 round.&lt;ref name="m1-18"/&gt; The NATO 5.56×45mm standard ammunition produced for U.S. forces is designated [[M855]].

Most, if not all, of the 7.62×39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about {{convert|3.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|6.7|in|cm|abbr=on}} earlier in tissue than the M43 round.&lt;ref name="uthr.org"&gt;Military rifle bullet wound patterns – by Martin L.

Retrieved on November 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ≈{{convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the newer M67 round verses ≈{{convert|29|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the older M43 round.&lt;ref name="frfrogspad.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uthr.org"/&gt; However, like the M43, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws (tumbles).&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uthr.org"/&gt;

There is now relative parity between the wounding capacity of the M67 and the current M855 5.56×45mm round.

Army Green Ammunition

128. Senator BURR. General Chiarelli, the Army has been developing a more effective and lead-free bullet to replace the currently fielded M855 5.56mm round for several years, commonly referred to as green ammunition. The initial plan was to
field the first installment of 20 million green rounds late last summer but this was delayed as a result of significant testing failures, particularly when the rounds were exposed to high temperatures. Are you confident this ammunition will be ready for
combat by June of this year, as earlier stated by the Army?

General Chiarelli. The temperature issue experienced with the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) has been corrected. The Army has begun to issue the M855A1 to our soldiers in Afghanistan, packaged for use with the M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Early reports we have received about the cartridge’s performance have been very favorable. The Army has produced and accepted over 45 million M855A1 EPR cartridges and 1.1 million EPR cartridges have been airlifted through Kuwait and are now in Afghanistan. Additionally, 4.6 million EPR cartridges have arrived via sealift to the CENTCOM area of operations (AO); 14.5 million cartridges are scheduled to arrive in the CENTCOM AO by October 12 and another 7 million are now planned for delivery in late December.

129. Senator Burr. General Chiarelli, are you confident that the green ammo provides a comparable performance to other rounds currently being fielded by other Services, including the SOST round being acquired by the Marine Corps and SOCOM?

General Chiarelli. The M855A1 EPR cartridge is an improved version of the M855 cartridge that is fired from the M4 carbine and M16 rifle. The M855A1 incorporates a product improved projectile and improved propellant which provides significantly enhanced performance against a wide variety of targets. The M855A1 provides improved hard target capability, more consistent performance against soft targets, improved accuracy, and reduced muzzle flash. These performance improvements were incorporated without an increase to cartridge weight or size. Approval of the M855A1 for fielding for use in the M4 carbine and M16 rifle has been requested. The M855A1 outperforms the Special Operations Science and Technology cartridge (SOST) in accuracy, and terminal consistency against soft targets. The M855A1 meets the Army requirements of perforating 3/8 inch steel and matches the 5.56 mm M856 trace whereas the SOST does not. The M855A1 also has better performance against Kevlar, and against concrete masonry than does the SOST.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army was so impressed with the M855A1 EPR round&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2014/pdf/other/2014DOTEAnnualReport.pdf Director, Operational Test and Evaluation FY 2014 Annual Report This report satisfies the provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 139.

"One of the first units to be issued the M855A1 is the 1st Brigade 101st Airborne Division. Chief Warrant Officer (CW2) Daigle of the 101st ABN had the following comments to say about the new cartridge:
* After being issued the round, testing it on ranges and finally taking it into combat, not a single negative review has followed
* Soldiers rave about it—its "stopping power" is amazing say most soldiers
* I have spoken to TF Bastogne snipers that say they have killed enemy combatants at 700m with this new round
* I have personally hit targets on known distance ranges at 600m
* There is no question that this round has increased accuracy at greater distances and much improved through and through issues
The M855A1 EPR may be green, and reports are still pretty thin, but it very well could be the ammo the Army was asking for all along. It is more effective all around, with improved penetration through Kevlar, mild steel, concrete, and vehicle components like doors and auto glass and even helicopters bodies, to name a few, and better accuracy, higher velocities, less wind sensitivity and more precision complementing its superior terminal results."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guns.com/2013/07/25/army-speeding-m855a1-epr-adoption-7-62-nato-variant-in-the-works/  Army Speeding M855A1 EPR Adoption, 7.62 NATO Variant in the Works. 7/25/13. by Max Slowik.

===Firepower===
'''Rates of fire'''

Both the AK-47 and the M16 are [[select-fire]] weapons capable of firing in semi-automatic and full-auto, or semi-auto and 3-round-burst for the later model M16s. However, the semi-auto and 3-round-burst capability of the M16A2 and M4 models have less combat capability than their predecessors or AK-47 type rifles.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; This is due to the elimination of full-auto mode of fire&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; In addition, the burst mechanism does not recycle; if one or two rounds are fired because the trigger is not held long enough, the next pull of the trigger will not result in a three-round burst, but will result in one or two shots being fired.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The M4A1 and HK416 have abandoned the 3-round-burst capability and returned to the more traditional semi-automatic and full-auto modes of fire, while the M16A4 retains the 3-round burst mode.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110430/NEWS/104300326/Improved-carbines-headed-your-way | ''Army Times''.

'''Available firepower'''

The standard magazine capacity for both the AK-47 and M16 type rifles is 30 rounds, although lower and higher capacity magazines are available for both systems. However, the single most limiting factor in terms of firepower is the amount of ammunition that a soldier can carry.&lt;ref&gt;''Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle''.

This close-support, 140&amp;nbsp;mm spherical rocket-propelled grenade was developed around 1977 and put into limited service by the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's Infantry Weapons 1995–96'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAW's 1-kg [[high explosive squash head]] (HESH) warhead can penetrate 20&amp;nbsp;cm of reinforced concrete (creating a 36&amp;nbsp;cm-wide hole) and hit moving targets at a range of 300 meters. The RAW is no longer used by the USMC. It has been replaced by the Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (also called SMAW).||

The M16 is 44.25 inches (1124mm) long with an [[M7 bayonet]] attached.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; The M7 bayonet is based on earlier designs such as the [[M4 bayonet|M4]], [[M5 bayonet|M5]], &amp; [[M6 bayonet|M6]] bayonets, all of which are direct descendants of the [[M3 Fighting Knife]] and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer [[M9 bayonet]] has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The current USMC [[OKC-3S bayonet]] bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic [[Ka-Bar]] fighting knife with serrations near the handle.

The AK is 40.15 inches (1020mm) long with an AKM type bayonet attached.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110629045939/http://www.izhmash.ru/eng/product/akm.shtml |Izhmash AK-47 technical specifications&lt;/ref&gt; The AK-47 has an adequate but unremarkable bayonet.

===Reliability===

The AK-47 has always enjoyed a reputation for rugged reliability and has a malfunction rate of one per 1000 rounds fired.&lt;ref name="Hearings 1969"&gt;Hearings, Reports and Prints of the House Committee on Armed Services, Issue 14, Part 1. United States. Congress. House. Committee on Armed Services. U.S. Government Printing Office. 1969. page 2326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahaner|first=Larry|title=AK-47: The Weapon that Changed the Face of War|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-16880-6|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses a [[gas operated|long-stroke gas system]], where the gas is sent from the barrel to push a piston attached to the bolt carrier, thus operating the action. The gas tube is fairly large and is visible above the barrel with ports or vents to allow the excess "dirty" gas to escape without affecting the action. The AK-47 is often built with generous clearances, allowing it to function easily in a dirty environment with little or no maintenance. This makes it reliable but less accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Steve|title=Twenty-First Century Small Arms|year=2003|publisher=Zenith Press|isbn=978-0-7603-1503-3|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M16 has always had a reputation for poor reliability and has a malfunction rate of two per 1000 rounds fired.&lt;ref name="Hearings 1969"/&gt; The M16 uses a unique gas powered operating system. "This gas operating system works by passing high pressure propellant gasses tapped from the barrel down a tube and into the carrier group within the upper receiver, and is commonly but incorrectly referred to as a "[[direct impingement|direct impingement gas system]]". The gas expands within a donut shaped gas cylinder within the carrier. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gasses and thus converts the energy of the gas to movement of the rifle’s parts. The bolt bears a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. It is more correct to call it an "internal piston" system."&lt;ref name=:54&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054,%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive,%20020815.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517092821/http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054%2C%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive%2C%20020815.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-17 |df= }} Armalite Technical Note 54: Direct Impingement Versus Piston Drive.&lt;/ref&gt; This design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be "burned off". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment. As a result, it became the target of a Congressional investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahaner|first=Larry|title=AK-47: The Weapon that Changed the Face of War|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-16880-6|page=236|quote=This was dubbed the Ichord hearings after Missouri representative Richard Ichord, who championed Congress's inquiry into failures of the M-16 during the Vietnam War.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; The investigation found that:&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;

{{quote|
* The M16 was billed as self cleaning (when no weapon is or ever has been).&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* The M16 was issued to troops without cleaning kits or instruction on how to clean the rifle.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* The M16 and 5.56×45mm cartridge was tested and approved with the use of a DuPont IMR8208M stick powder, that was switched to Olin Mathieson WC846 ball powder which produced much more fouling, that quickly jammed the action of the M16 (unless the gun was cleaned well and often).&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* The M16 lacked a [[forward assist]] (rendering the rifle inoperable when it jammed).&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* The M16 lacked a chromed barrel and chamber, causing corrosion problems, contributing to case swelling and extraction failures (which was considered the most severe problem and required extreme measures to clear, such as inserting the cleaning-rod down the barrel and knocking the spent cartridge out).&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;}}

(The [[M14 rifle|M14]] was preferred by 15 percent, while less than one percent wished to carry either the [[Stoner 63|Stoner rifle]], the AK-47, the [[M1 carbine|carbine]] or a pistol.)"&lt;ref name="a953117"/&gt; In March 1970, the "President’s Blue Ribbon Defense Panel" concluded that the issuance of the M16 saved the lives of 20,000 U.S. servicemen during the Vietnam War, who would have otherwise died had the M14 remained in service.&lt;ref name="pogoarchives.org"/&gt; However the M16 rifle's reputation continues to suffer.&lt;ref name=SAOW/&gt;

After the introduction of the M4 Carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5&amp;nbsp;inches also has a negative effect on reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5&amp;nbsp;inches instead of the 13&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="armalite.com"&gt;[http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2048,%20Barrel%20Design,%20Heat,%20and%20Reliability,%20030824%E2%80%A6.pdf Technical note 48: the effects of barrel design and heat on reliability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111015504/http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes/Tech%20Note%2048%2C%20Barrel%20Design%2C%20Heat%2C%20and%20Reliability%2C%20030824%E2%80%A6.pdf |date=2011-11-11 }}. armalite.com.

Using the HK-proprietary gas piston system found on the G36, the HK416 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the weapon’s interior, making it the most reliable of any M4/M16 type weapon.

The HK416 has been combat-proven in Southwest Asia and has also gained the attention of military, law enforcement, and security users outside of the US. In April 2007, the HK416 was selected as the new Norwegian Army rifle.

The origins of the HK416 began with the realization of the deficiencies of the direct gas impingement (gas tube) operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons. Input from the users of current M4/M16-type arms, high-speed video assessment, and extensive live-fire testing in extreme operational environments such as the U.S. Army Desert Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona revealed multiple areas for improvement.

Improvements were made to the internal operating system and miscellaneous component parts to improve reliability in best and worse case scenarios, with all types of ammunition, with all barrel lengths and with and without sound suppressors attached.

An innovative free-floating 4-quadrant rail system designed by HK allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the HK416. This HK rail system and can be installed and removed without tools.

The HK-proprietary gas system uses a piston driving an operating rod to control the function of the bolt, preventing propellant gases and the associated carbon fouling from entering the weapon’s interior. This increases the reliability of the weapon and extends the interval between stoppages. It also reduces operator cleaning time, heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and wear and tear on critical components.

To improve reliability, service life, and operator safety during obstructed bore occurrences or after extreme extended firing sessions, the HK416 uses barrels produced by Heckler &amp; Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process.

The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy for more than 20,000 rounds with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity. HK416 variants are available with 10.4-, 14.5-, 16.5-, and 20-inch (264, 368, 419, 508 mm) barrels. Some HK416 variants also have "OTB" (Over-the-beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely drained.

In addition to the improvements in the baseline weapon, HK has produced a corrosion resistant steel magazine and a proprietary buffer to improve functional reliability.

An add-on single shot [[40×46mm]] grenade launcher module can be quickly attached to the rail system of all models without tools. HK has applied its proven and fielded Safety Blank Firing Attachment and Live Round Excluder Magazine technology to the HK416, eliminating the possibility of live rounds being loaded into and fired through a standard issue weapon outfitted for blank firing only.

The HK416 is available as complete carbine or rifle or as a "drop-in" HK416 upper receiver module for use on the lower receivers of existing M4/M16 type weapons."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFOD"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cox|first=Matthew|date=March 1, 2007|title=Better than M4, but you can't have one|journal=Army Times |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/02/atCarbine070219/|accessdate=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/03/Army_no416s_031008w/ Army takes HK416s from special unit – Army News, opinions, editorials, news from Iraq, photos, reports].

===Magazines===
"Magazines are one of the most important elements of any firearm design. They are responsible for the feeding portion of the cycle of operation. Even in the most proven arm that reliably extracts and ejects, the magazine has to be 100-percent reliable for it to consistently feed properly."&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartocci |first=Christopher R. |url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/ArticlePage.aspx?id=2157&amp;cid=4 |title=Feeding the Modern Semi-Automatic Rifle |publisher=Americanrifleman.org |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AK-47’s 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with "feed-lips" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that "Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers."&lt;ref&gt;http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=419 | Identifying &amp; Collecting the 7.62×39 AK-47/AKM Magazine. by Edward T.

The M16's magazine was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"/&gt; As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Therefore, it is easier to damage than an AK-47 magazine and the feed lips are proportionally weaker when compared to the AK-47.&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"/&gt;  The M16 originally used a 20-round magazine which was later replaced by a bent 30-round design.&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"/&gt;  As a result, the magazine follower tends to rock or tilt, causing malfunctions.&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"/&gt;  Many non-U.S. and commercial magazines have been developed to effectively mitigate these shortcomings (e.g., H&amp;K's all-stainless-steel magazine, Magpul's polymer P-MAG, etc.).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americanrifleman1"/&gt; Standard USGI aluminum 30-round M16 magazines weigh {{convert|0.11|kg|lb|abbr=on}} empty and are 7.1 inches long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colt.com/mil/M4_2.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616210348/http://www.colt.com/mil/M4_2.asp |archivedate=2011-06-16 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defensereview.com/dr-exclusive-surefire-60-shot-and-100-shot-ar-ar-15m16-5-56mm-nato-box-magazines-for-infantry-combat-and-tactical-engagements-meet-the-surefire-mag5-60-and-mag5-100-high-capacity-magazines-hcms/ | DR Exclusive!: SureFire "Quad-Stack" AR Rifle Magazines: SureFire 60-Shot and 100-Shot AR (AR-15/M16) 5.56mm NATO Box Magazines for Significantly-Increased Firepower during Infantry Combat and Tactical Engagements of All Sorts: Meet the SureFire MAG5-60 and MAG5-100 High Capacity Magazines (HCMs). by David Crane in Featured, New And Future Technology, Rifles And Carbines, Special Operations on December 3rd, 2010… Standard MILSPEC USGI 30-Round Magazine Specs (data provided by SureFire): Height: 7.1" and Weight-Empty: 3.9 ounces&lt;/ref&gt; The newer plastic magazines are about a half inch longer.

In 2009, the U.S. Military began fielding an "improved magazine" identified by a tan-colored follower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peosoldier.armylive.dodlive.mil/2009/12/14/armys-improved-magazine-increases-weapons-reliability-%e2%80%9ctan-is-the-plan%e2%80%9d-for-the-new-magazine/ Article includes a magazine animation].

'''Night firing'''

The AR-15 was not equipped with any flash suppressor during the conduct of this test. Also, there was only a small amount of ammunition available for use in the AK-47. As a result, the night firing capability of both the AR-15 and AK-47 were not properly tested. In a subsequent test at Fort Benning an AR-15 equipped with a flash suppressor was tested against both the M14 and the AK-47. The AK-47 was not equipped with a flash suppressor.&lt;ref name="RES"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">A '''crisis camp''' is a [[BarCamp]] gathering of [[Information technology|IT]] professionals, [[software developer]]s, and computer [[programmer]]s to aid in the relief efforts of a major crisis such as those caused by [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, or [[hurricane]]s. Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Due to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the Crisis Commons volunteer community was mobilized and part of the effort is being coordinated by Japanese students at U.S. universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Japanese-PM-Appeals-for-Unity-to-Face-Earthquake--117895114.html|title=Japanese Engineers Struggle With Several Damaged Nuclear Reactors|publisher=''Voice of America''|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5442">'''Critical code studies''' (CCS) is an emerging academic subfield, related to [[software studies]], [[digital humanities]], [[cultural studies]], [[computer science]], [[human-computer interface]], and the [[do-it-yourself]] [[maker culture]]. Its primary focus is on the cultural significance of [[computer code]], without excluding or focusing solely upon the code's functional purpose.

As introduced by Mark C. Marino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/codology|title=Critical Code Studies - Electronic Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; critical code studies was initially a method by which scholars "can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature," but the concept also draws upon Espen Aarseth's conception of a cybertext as a "mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal signs" (Cybertext, 21), arguing that in order to understand a digital artifact we must also understand the constraints and capabilities of the authoring tools used by the creator of the artifact, as well as the memory storage and interface required for the user to experience the digital artifact.

Evidence that critical code studies has gained momentum since 2006 include an article by Matthew Kirschenbaum in the Chronicle of Higher Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science/14806/|title=Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide|first=Matthew|last=Kirschenbaum|date=23 January 2009|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCS sessions at the Modern Language Association in 2011 that were "packed" with attendees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Hard-Times-Sharpen-the-MLAs/125905/|title=Hard Times Sharpen the MLA's Lens on Labor and the Humanities|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|date=9 January 2011|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; several academic conferences devoted wholly to critical code studies, and a book devoted to the explication of a single line of computer code, titled ''10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Montfort |first1=Nick |last2=Baudoin |first2=Patsy |last3=Bell |first3=John |last4=Bogost |first4=Ian |last5=Douglass |first5=Jeremy |last6=Marino |first6=Mark C. |last7=Mateas |first7=Michael |last8=Reas |first8=Casey |last9=Sample |first9=Mark |last10=Vawter |first10=Noah |title=10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 |date=November 2012 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262018463 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/10-print-chr2055rnd1-goto-10 |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">The '''neXt Generation program''' or '''XG''' is a technology development project sponsored by [[DARPA]]'s [[Strategic Technology Office]], with the goals to "develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to dynamically redistribute allocated [[spectrum]] along with novel waveforms in order to provide dramatic improvements in assured [[military communications]] in support of a full range of worldwide deployments."&lt;ref name=sto1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/sto/smallunitops/xg.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316162019/http://www.darpa.mil/sto/smallunitops/xg.html|archivedate=2010-03-16|title=XG Fact sheet|publisher=[[DARPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Wireless World Research Forum]] of 27 October 2003, Preston Marshall, program manager of DARPA XG Program, said "The primary product of the XG program is not a new radio, but a set of advanced technologies for dynamic spectrum
access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc41/files/IEICE_SCC41_01Aug08.pdf |publisher=IEEE |work=SCC41 |title=Standards for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118225939/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc41/files/IEICE_SCC41_01Aug08.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DITA Open Toolkit''' ('''DITA-OT''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] publishing engine for XML content authored in the Darwin Information Typing Architecture ([[Darwin Information Typing Architecture|DITA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linton, Jen  |author2=Bruski, Kylene|title=Introduction to DITA: A Basic User Guide to the Darwin Information Typing Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Comtech Services|isbn=0-9778634-0-9|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toolkit's extensible plug-in mechanism allows users to add their own transformations and customize the default output, which includes:&lt;ref name=doc-site&gt;{{cite web|title=DITA-OT documentation|url=http://www.dita-ot.org/dev/|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Help
* [[HTML5]]
* [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help]]
* [[Markdown]]
* [[PDF]], through [[XSL-FO]]
* [[troff]]
* [[XHTML]] and XHTML with a [[JavaScript]] [[Frameset (HTML)|frameset]]

Originally developed by [[IBM]] and released to open source in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DITA-OT 1.0 release|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/dita-ot/files/DITA-OT%20Stable%20Release/dita-ot%201.0.0/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution packages contain [[Apache Ant|Ant]], [[Apache FOP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Saxon XSLT|Saxon]], and [[Xerces]].

Most DITA authoring tools and DITA [[content management systems|CMS]]s integrate the DITA-OT, or parts of it, into their publishing workflows.

Standalone tools have also been developed to run the DITA-OT via a [[graphical user interface]] instead of the command line.

'''DataSplice''', LLC is a [[mobile software]] company headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado and offers [[mobile applications]] which extend [[enterprise systems]], including packaged software for [[Enterprise Asset Management]] (EAM) and [[computerized maintenance management system]]s (CMMS). The software provides an interface from these systems to handhelds, [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and mobile computers. It may also be used on a desktop system as a unified/simplified interface for multiple systems.
[[File:DataSplice Architecture.gif|thumb|DataSplice Architecture]]

The software offered is a mobile [[middleware]], with an emphasis on [[IBM]]'s Maximo EAM system. Its primary client base is focused on utilities, gas/oil, defense, aerospace and other markets which utilizes field service management systems which require tracking, asset management and regulatory accountability.

DataSplice does not use a proprietary software platform, but rather utilizes the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) of Microsoft.NET framework’s [[ADO.NET]], which allows for connectivity to different database systems such as [[MySQL]] and [[Oracle database|Oracle]]. The [[extensible]] system consists of three components, including a remote client (for handheld and/or desktop use), a server which communicates with the primary EAM, and an administration client for configuring the system.

==History==
Originally known as Optimization Resources, which was founded in 1991, DataSplice was spun off as both a company and product in 2001. The original management and development staff continue to be engaged in daily operations. DataSplice is a privately held company.

==Products==
The product's main emphasis is providing a simplified mobile interface into IBM Maximo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Solutions Directory |url=http://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=37287&amp;lc=en&amp;stateCd=P&amp;page=2&amp;print=true |work=IBM - DataSplice Mobile Integration |publisher=IBM |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927100759/http://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=37287&amp;lc=en&amp;stateCd=P&amp;page=2&amp;print=true |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The product consists of three components: Remote Client, Administration Client and the Server. The primary modules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DataSplice Mobile Computing Solutions: Inventory and Work Orders |url=http://www.fieldtechnologiesonline.com/article.mvc/DataSplice-Mobile-Computing-Solutions-Invento-0001 |work=Field Technologies Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181518/http://fieldtechnologiesonline.com/article.mvc/DataSplice-Mobile-Computing-Solutions-Invento-0001 |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are Inventory, Work Orders, Inspections, Condition Monitoring and Asset Management.

The product's remote client, is [[HTML5 in mobile devices|HTML5]] compliant, and as such is platform agnostic. Supported systems include iOS (iPad), Android (Droid), and Windows Mobile and 8 (Surface, Phone and Desktop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Workers Demanding Technology Options|url=http://www.prlog.org/12016455-mobile-field-workers-demanding-technology-options.html|publisher=PRLOG|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The remote client is also able to utilize bar code scanners, mobile printers, and RFID readers.

In 2010, DataSplice introduced InspecTMI, a field inspections and operator rounds mobile collection system geared toward highly regulated inspection scenarios, such as substations, power generation, and safety inspections.

The '''Department for Business, Innovation and Skills''' ('''BIS''') was a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|ministerial department of the United Kingdom Government]] created on 5 June 2009 by the merger of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] (DIUS) and the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (BERR). It was disbanded on the creation of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] on 14 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 Prime Minister's Office: Changes to the machinery of Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608051333/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 |date=8 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the department's dissolution, it no longer has ministers responsible.&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills#ministers |title=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=www.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Permanent Secretary]] was [[Martin Donnelly (UK civil servant)|Sir Martin Donnelly]].

==Responsibilities==
Some policies apply to [[England]] alone due to [[devolution]], while others are not devolved and therefore apply to other nations of the [[United Kingdom]]. The department was responsible for [[United Kingdom Government|UK Government]] policy in the following areas:&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"/&gt;
* [[business]] regulation and support
* [[company law]]
* [[Competition (economics)|competition]]
* [[consumer affairs]]
* [[corporate governance]]
* [[employment relations]]
* [[export]] licensing
* [[further education]]
* [[higher education]]
* [[innovation]]
* [[insolvency]]
* [[intellectual property]]
* [[outer space]]
* [[post office|postal]] affairs
* regional and local [[economic development]]
* [[science]] and [[research]]
* [[skills]]
* [[trade]]
* [[training]]

==Devolution==
Economic policy is mostly devolved but several important policy areas are reserved to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]].  Further and higher education policy is mostly devolved.  [[Reserved and excepted matters]] are outlined below.

A '''digital divide''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="NTIA95"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

==Definitions and usage==
The term ''digital divide'' describes a gap in terms of access to and usage of [[information and communication technology]]. It was traditionally considered to be a question of having or not having access,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but with a global [[mobile phone]] penetration of over 95%,&lt;ref name="ITU-IndividualsUsingTheInternet"/&gt; it is becoming a relative inequality between those who have more and less bandwidth&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; and more or fewer skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MGraham" /&gt; Conceptualizations of the digital divide have been described as "who, with which characteristics, connects how to what":&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
* Who is the subject that connects: individuals, organizations, enterprises, schools, hospitals, countries, etc.
* Which characteristics&amp;nbsp;or attributes are distinguished to describe the divide: income, education, age, geographic location, motivation, reason not to use, etc.
* How sophisticated is the usage: mere access, retrieval, interactivity, intensive and extensive in usage, innovative contributions, etc.
* To what does&amp;nbsp;the subject connect: fixed or mobile, Internet or telephone, digital TV, broadband, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ishti.org/2016/10/17/can-online-degrees-reduce-global-inequalities-in-education/ "Digital Divide and Global Inequalities in Education"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Different authors focus on different aspects, which leads to a large variety of definitions of the digital divide. "For example, counting with only 3 different choices of subjects (individuals, organizations, or countries), each with 4 characteristics (age, wealth, geography, sector), distinguishing between 3 levels of digital adoption (access, actual usage and effective adoption), and 6 types of technologies (fixed phone, mobile... Internet...), already results in 3x4x3x6 = 216 different ways to define the digital divide. Each one of them seems equally reasonable and depends on the objective pursued by the analyst".&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
The "digital divide" is also referred to by a variety of other terms which have similar meanings, though may have a slightly different emphasis: digital inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/performance/digital-inclusion |title=Dashboard - Digital inclusion |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital participation,&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalparticipation.scot/&lt;/ref&gt; basic digital skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetechpartnership.com/basic-digital-skills/basic-digital-skills-framework/ |title=Tech Partnership Legacy |work=Thetechpartnership.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media literacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research |title=Media literacy |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and digital accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rouse |first=Margaret |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/digital-accessibility |title=What is digital accessibility? - Definition from WhatIs.com |work=Whatis.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a US-based [[nonprofit organization]], has found the term "digital divide" to be problematic, since there are a multiplicity of divides. Instead, they chosen to use the term "digital inclusion", providing a definition:
Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).  This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NDIA |year= 2017 |url= https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/ |accessdate= June 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of connectivity==

===Infrastructure===
The infrastructure by which individuals, households, businesses, and communities connect to the Internet address the physical mediums that people use to connect to the Internet such as desktop computers, laptops, basic mobile phones or [[smartphones]], iPods or other MP3 players, gaming consoles such as Xbox or PlayStation, electronic book readers, and tablets such as iPads.&lt;ref&gt;Zickuher, Kathryn. 2011.

Traditionally the nature of the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices. Given the increasing number of such devices, some have concluded that the digital divide among individuals has increasingly been closing as the result of a natural and almost automatic process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Compaine, B.M.

The Digital Divide and What to Do About It. New Economy Handbook, p. 824, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn zickuhr. Who's not online and why? Pew Research Center, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/asi.23020 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | volume=65 | issue = 4 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | year = 2016 | title = The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | url = http://www.martinhilbert.net/the-bad-news-is-that-the-digital-access-divide-is-here-to-stay | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 40 | issue = 6| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach – ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009). An innovated objective digital divide measure, ''Journal of Communication and Computer'', Volume 6, No.12 (Serial No.61), USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paschalidou, Georgia,  (2011), Digital divide and disparities in the use of new technologies, https://dspace.lib.uom.gr/bitstream/2159/14899/6/PaschalidouGeorgiaMsc2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The bit as the unifying variable ====
[[File:Hilbert DigitalBitsDivide.png|thumb |300px |Fixed-line phone and Internet 2000–2010: subscriptions (top) and kbit/s (bottom) per capita&lt;ref&gt;Figures 11 and 12 in [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization (1986–2007/2010)"]. Hilbert, Martin. Working paper INF/15-E, International Telecommunications Union. December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Instead of tracking various kinds of digital divides among fixed and mobile phones, narrow- and broadband Internet, digital TV, etc., it has recently been suggested to simply measure the amount of kbit/s per actor.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertEquip2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01972241003712199 | volume=26 | issue=3 | title=Information Societies or "ICT Equipment Societies?" Measuring the Digital Information-Processing Capacity of a Society in Bits and Bytes | year=2010 | journal=The Information Society | pages=157–178 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization"], Martin Hilbert (2011), Presented at the 9th World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Meeting, Mauritius: International Telecommunication Union (ITU); free access to the article can be found here: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has shown that the digital divide in kbit/s per capita is actually widening in relative terms: "While the average inhabitant of the developed world counted with some 40 kbit/s more than the average member of the information society in developing countries in 2001, this gap grew to over 3 Mbit/s per capita in 2010."&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011" /&gt; 

The upper graph of the Figure on the side shows that the divide between developed and developing countries has been diminishing when measured in terms of subscriptions per capita. In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality" /&gt; This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that "the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies".&lt;ref name="ITUmeasuring2012"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf "Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills and digital literacy===
However, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. There are at least three factors at play: information accessibility, information utilization and information receptiveness. More than just accessibility, individuals need to know how to make use of the information and communication tools once they exist within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Mun-cho, K. &amp; Jong-Kil, K. (2001).

Park (Eds.), The human society and the Internet: Internet related socio-economic Issues, First International Conference, Seoul, Korea: Proceedings, Springer, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Information professionals have the ability to help bridge the gap by providing reference and information services to help individuals learn and utilize the technologies to which they do have access, regardless of the economic status of the individual seeking help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aqili | first1 = S. | last2 = Moghaddam | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Bridging the digital divide: The role of librarians and information professionals in the third millennium | journal = Electronic Library | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 226–237 | doi = 10.1108/02640470810864118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Internet connectivity can be utilized at a variety of locations such as homes, offices, schools, libraries, public spaces, Internet cafe and others. There are also varying levels of connectivity in rural, suburban, and urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, Gretchen. 2010. Latinos and Digital Technology, 2010.

==Reasons and correlating variables==

The gap in a digital divide may exist for a number of reasons. Obtaining access to ICTs and using them actively has been linked to a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics: among them income, education, race, gender, geographic location (urban-rural), age, skills, awareness, political, cultural and psychological attitudes.&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Tait|title=15 Years of Chinese Internet Usage in 13 Pretty Graphs|url=http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|work=NanjingMarketingGroup.com|publisher=CNNIC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140422192031/http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|archivedate=April 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Wensheng.

As for geographic location, people living in urban centers have more access and show more usage of computer services than those in rural areas. Gender was previously thought to provide an explanation for the digital divide, many thinking ICT were male gendered, but controlled statistical analysis has shown that income, education and employment act as [[confounding variables]] and that women with the same level of income, education and employment actually embrace ICT more than men (see [[ICT4D#Women and ICT4D|Women and ICT4D]]).&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Hilbert | first= Martin | title = Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries?

For example, the [[Digital Divide in Germany|digital divide in Germany]] is unique because it is not largely due to difference in quality of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/sw_2007/papers/schleife.pdf|title=Regional Versus. Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|last=Schliefe|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|website=|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One telling fact is that "as income rises so does Internet use ...",  strongly suggesting that the digital divide persists at least in part due to income disparities.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R.E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science. 178-179. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.

In research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Carolina J. | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = | journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583–620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usage, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why, to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt; "The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs".&lt;ref&gt;Galperin, H. (2010). Goodbye digital divide, Hello digital confusion? A critical embrace of the emerging ICT4D consensus. Information Technologies and International Development, 6 Special Edition, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the desired impact and "the end justifies the definition" of the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt;

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.

Overcoming the divide 
See also|Information and communication technologies for development}}

An individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the "magical number" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America| doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019| journal = World Development| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 756–770| year = 2010| url = http://martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.

Furthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay&lt;/ref&gt; It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm "UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.

In the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme]] launched its Online Volunteering service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo, Manuel. 2005. [http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org/fileadmin/docdb/pdf/2006/Acevedo_Volunteering_in_the_Information_Society_2005.pdf%20 Volunteering in the information society], Research paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media websites serve as both manifestations of and means by which to combat the digital divide. The former describes phenomena such as the divided users demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites host thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.

=== Libraries ===
[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]

Attempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where very low access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an "online indigenous digital library as part of public library services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = | journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30–9 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.

To address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] began the Gates Library Initiative. The Gates Foundation focused on providing more than just access, they placed computers and provided training in libraries. In this manner if users began to struggle while using a computer, the user was in a setting where assistance and guidance was available. Further, the Gates Library Initiative was "modeled on the old-fashioned life preserver: The support needs to be around you to keep you afloat."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends. Prior conditions in Kenya—lack of funding, language and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement for those citizens. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began. In the early 2000s, The Carnegie Foundation funded a revitalization project through the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS). Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies (ICT) to their patrons. In 2012, public libraries in the Busia and Kiberia communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools. By 2013, the program expanded into ten schools.&lt;ref&gt;Pingo, Z. B. (2015). Transition from Camel Libraries to Digital Technologies in Kenya Public Libraries. Public Library Quarterly, 34(1), 63-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective use==
[[Community Informatics]] (CI) provides a somewhat different approach to addressing the digital divide by focusing on issues of "use" rather than simply "access".   CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the "effective use" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of "open data" and coined the term "data divide" to refer to this issue area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Social capital===
Once an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a "digital citizen".&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;

=== Economic disparity ===
In the United States, research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.&lt;ref name=Forbes1/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world. A BCG Report suggests that in countries like Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K., the digital connection among communities is made easier, allowing for their populations to obtain a much larger share of the economies via digital business.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/22/the-real-threat-to-economic-growth-is-the-digital-divide/|title=The Real Threat to Economic Growth Is the Digital Divide|last=Foroohar|first=Rana|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In fact, in these places, populations hold shares approximately 2.5 percentage points higher.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth/&gt; During a meeting with the United Nations a Bangladesh representative expressed his concern that poor and undeveloped countries would be left behind due to a lack of funds to bridge the digital gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing Digital Divide Critical to Social, Economic Development, Delegates Say at Second Committee Debate on Information and Communications Technologies {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaef3432.doc.htm|website=www.un.org|accessdate=September 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The digital divide also impacts children's ability to learn and grow in low-income school districts. Without Internet access, students are unable to cultivate necessary tech skills in order to understand today's dynamic economy.&lt;ref name=RichPoor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/digital-divide-the-technology-gap-between-rich-and-poor|title=Digital Divide: The Technology Gap between the Rich and Poor|website=Digital Responsibility|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Federal Communication Commission's Broadband Task Force created a report showing that about 70% of teachers give students homework that demand access to broadband.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neatoday.org/2016/04/20/the-homework-gap/|title=The Homework Gap: The 'Cruelest Part of the Digital Divide'|date=April 20, 2016|website=NEA Today|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even more, approximately 65% of young scholars use the Internet at home to complete assignments as well as connect with teachers and other students via discussion boards and shared files.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;A recent study indicates that practically 50% of students say that they are unable to finish their homework due to an inability to either connect to the Internet, or in some cases, find a computer.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;This has led to a new revelation: 42% of students say they received a lower grade because of this disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Finally, according to research conducted by the Center for American Progress, "if the United States were able to close the educational achievement gaps between native-born white children and black and Hispanic children, the U.S. economy would be 5.8 percent—or nearly $2.3 trillion—larger in 2050".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.net-ref.com/whitepaper-connected-classroom/|title=The Digital Divide in the Age of the Connected Classroom {{!}} NetRef|date=January 14, 2016|work=NetRef|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographic differences ===
Furthermore, according to the 2012 Pew Report "Digital Differences", a mere 62% of households who make less than $30,000 a year use the Internet, while 90% of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 had access.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Studies also show that only 51% of Hispanics and 49% of African Americans have high-speed Internet at home. This is compared to the 66% of Caucasians that too have high-speed Internet in their households.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Overall, 10% of all Americans don't have access to high-speed Internet, an equivalent of almost 34 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/technology/the-challenges-of-closing-the-digital-divide.html|title=The Challenges of Closing the Digital Divide|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=June 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Supplemented reports from the Guardian demonstrate the global effects of limiting technological developments in poorer nations, rather than simply the effects in the United States. Their study shows that the rapid digital expansion excludes those who find themselves in the lower class. 60% of the world's population, almost 4 billion people, have no access to the Internet and are thus left worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/13/internet-not-conquered-digital-divide-rich-poor-world-bank-report|title=Spread of internet has not conquered 'digital divide' between rich and poor – report|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=January 13, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Knowledge divide===
Since gender, age, racial, income, and educational gaps in the digital divide have lessened compared to past levels, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a [[knowledge divide]].&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; A knowledge divide concerning technology presents the possibility that the gap has moved beyond access and having the resources to connect to ICTs to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected.&lt;ref&gt;Sciadas, George. (2003). Monitoring the Digital Divide…and Beyond. [[Orbicom-UNESCO|Orbicom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-level digital divide===
The second-level digital divide, also referred to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the Internet from the producers of content.&lt;ref name="Reilley"&gt;Reilley, Collen A. Teaching Wikipedia as a Mirrored Technology. First Monday, Vol. 16, No. 1-3, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the Internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Graham | first1 = M.| title = Time machines and virtual portals: The spatialities of the digital divide| doi = 10.1177/146499341001100303| journal = Progress in Development Studies| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 211–227|date=July 2011| citeseerx = 10.1.1.659.9379}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with more and more of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the Internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.&lt;ref name="MGraham"&gt;Graham, Mark (2014).

New applications have made it possible for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to be a creator of content, yet the majority of user generated content available widely on the Internet, like public blogs, is created by a small portion of the Internet using population. [[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.&lt;ref name="Reilley" /&gt; Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.

Some of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.&lt;ref name="Schradie"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | format = PDF | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status. Users of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in content creation due to disadvantages in education and lack of the necessary free time for the work involved in blog or web site creation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Schradie" /&gt;  Additionally, there is evidence to support the existence of the second-level digital divide at the K-12 level based on how educators' use technology for instruction.&lt;ref name="Reinhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reinhart | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = E. | last3 = Toriskie | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = K-12 Teachers: Technology Use and the Second Level Digital Divide | url = | journal = Journal of Instructional Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 3/4| page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools' economic factors have been found to explain variation in how teachers use technology to promote higher-order thinking skills.&lt;ref name="Reinhart" /&gt;

The global digital divide describes global disparities, primarily between [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], in regards to access to computing and information resources such as the [[Internet]] and the opportunities derived from such access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = Ming-te | year = 2001 | title = Digital divide in developing countries | url = http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Global Information Technology Management | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115838/http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | archivedate = August 26, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with a smaller [[unit of analysis]], this gap describes an inequality that exists, referencing a global scale.

The Internet is expanding very quickly, and not all countries—especially developing countries—are able to keep up with the constant changes. The term "digital divide" doesn't necessarily mean that someone doesn’t have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.

In fact, there is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only 3 countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt; This concentration is not new, as historically only 10 countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;

===Versus the digital divide===
The global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide, the focus is set on the fact that "Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world"&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized in regard to the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.

The global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[north-south divide]] of "northern" wealthier nations and "southern" poorer ones.

===Obstacles to a solution===
Some people argue that basic necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:
;Physical access 
Involves "the distribution of ICT devices per capita…and land lines per thousands".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations. 
;Financial access
The cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5" /&gt;
Financial access and "the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap" &lt;ref&gt;“Digital Divide.” The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Socio-demographic access
Empirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715–736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; 

While a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence show that this due to unfavorable conditions with respect to employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. On the contrary, in the contexts under study, women with the prerequsites for access and usage turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men.&lt;ref name=HilbertGend2011 /&gt;
;Cognitive access
In order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.  
;Design access
Computers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.&lt;/ref&gt;  
;Institutional access
In illustrating institutional access, Wilson states "the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercafés, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|303}} 
;Political access
Guillen &amp; Suarez argue that "democratic political regimes enable a faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes".&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.  Recently situations in Iran and China have denied people the ability to access certain websites and disseminate information.  Iran has prohibited the use of high-speed Internet in the country and has removed many satellite dishes in order to prevent the influence of [[Western culture]], such as music and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/oct/18/news.iran|first1=Robert|last1=Tait|date=July 23, 2006|title=Iran bans fast internet to cut west's influence|work=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Cultural access
Many experts claim that bridging the digital divide is not sufficient and that the images and language needed to be conveyed in a language and images that can be read across different cultural lines.&lt;ref name=Carr-2007/&gt; A 2013 study conducted by Pew Research Center noted how participants taking the survey in Spanish were nearly twice as likely to not use the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who’s Not Online and Why|date=September 25, 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

In the early 21st century, residents of developed countries enjoy many Internet services which are not yet widely available in developing countries, including:

* In tandem with the above point, mobile phones and small electronic communication devices;
* E-communities and social-networking;
* Fast broadband Internet connections, enabling advanced Internet applications;&lt;ref&gt;This graphic illustrates the difference in [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22ICT,%20Fixed%20Broadband,%20Subscribers%20per%20100,%20History%20and%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=1&amp;Dim1=%22Afr-SubSahar%22,%22EU27%22&amp;File=0 fixed broadband penetration (History and Forecast)] between the European Union and Sub-Saharan Africa from [[International Futures]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affordable and widespread Internet access, either through [[personal computer]]s at [[home]] or work, through public terminals in [[public library|public libraries]] and [[Internet cafe]]s, and through [[wireless access point]]s;
*[[E-commerce]] enabled by efficient electronic payment networks like [[credit card]]s and reliable [[shipping]] services;
*[[Virtual globe]]s featuring street maps searchable down to individual street addresses and detailed satellite and aerial photography;
* Online [[research]] systems like [[LexisNexis]] and [[ProQuest]] which enable users to peruse [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] articles that may be centuries old, without having to leave home;
* Electronic readers such as Kindle, Sony Reader, Samsung Papyrus and Iliad by iRex Technologies;
*[[Price engine]]s like [[Google Shopping]] which help [[consumer]]s find the best possible online [[price]]s, and similar services like [[ShopLocal]] which find the best possible prices at local [[Retailing|retailer]]s;
*[[Electronic services delivery]] of [[government]] services, such as the ability to pay [[tax]]es, [[fee]]s, and [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] online.
* Further civic engagement through e-government and other sources such as finding information about candidates regarding political situations.

==Global solutions==
{{Main|Information and Communication Technologies for Development}}

There are four specific arguments why it is important to "bridge the gap":&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"&gt;Digital Divide - ICT Information Communications Technology - 50x15 Initiative. (March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*Economic equality – For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency situation, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civil life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Social mobility – Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Democracy – Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|first=|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=http://www.sior.ub.edu|archive-date=September 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Economic growth – It is believed that less developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries are able to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

While these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

Using previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma &amp; Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, "internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.&lt;ref name=James-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54–61 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, computer literacy, and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.

It has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, "The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...Government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, "If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that "in developing nations…foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all important".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: "invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|111}}

There are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that "the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}}

Other proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries, so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their own problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet cafés to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.

At the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "power") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech "CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&amp;cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their own content, one scholar has posited that social media—like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—may be useful tools in closing the divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, "the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide".&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Facebook’s statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics "Facebook Statistics"], 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164409/http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics |date=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011/&gt; The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;

Some cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 "Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 "City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Basics===
{{Main|Free Basics}}

Free Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&amp;oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a "human right", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.

"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.

===Satellite constellations===

Several projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest hurdle of these projects is the astronomical financial and logistical costs of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said "It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this." Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.

===One Laptop per Child===

[[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"&gt;[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced "XO" laptops (dubbed the "$100 laptop", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet—as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"/&gt;

==World Summit on the Information Society==
{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}

Several of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:&lt;ref name=WSIS-03&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html "Declaration of Principles"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.
:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.
:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.
:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.
:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.
:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.
:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.
:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.
:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.
:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.

A '''DIP reader''' (Document Insertion Processor) is an electronic device for reading an [[Magnetic stripe card|electronically encoded card]] that is inserted and then removed from the device.

A typical dip reader is used for reading credit cards where the [[data]] are either encoded on a magnetic stripe or an internal [[Integrated circuit|computer chip]]. The magnetic stripe on a card is typically read as the card is extracted.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} If the card is a [[smart card]], then the data transfer typically takes place when the card is fully inserted. In this case, the card is held while [[data transfer]] is taking place.

'''Distinguo''' is a proprietary software application for [[Semantic search]] based on [[description logic]] that enables users to search for meaning instead of just keywords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/bwm/papers/20001221-paper/ Jena: B. McBride, Hewlett Packard Laboratories Bristol, UK] Retrieved 15 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This [[API]] permits developers to integrate into their applications a tool to parse [[natural language]] (generating an XML summary), and then measure the semantic "distance" between a query and a target text. ''Guha et al.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2003.org/cdrom/papers/refereed/p779/ess.html Guha, R. , McCool, Rob., Miller, Eric (2003) Semantic Search International World Wide Web Conference archive, Proceedings of the 12th international conference on World Wide Web table of contents, Budapest, Hungary]''Accessed 14 September 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish two major forms of search: Navigational and Research. In navigational search, the user is using the search engine as a navigation tool to navigate to a particular intended document. Semantic Search is not directly applicable to navigational searches. In Research Search, the user enters a phrase which is intended to denote the object of the research. The user will not know in advance which particular documents will contain the information; the task is to locate any number of documents which together will produce the sought information.

==Features==
The program is not available as a stand-alone or consumer application; it is a powerful software component for inclusion in other text analysis solutions such as any project requiring the comparison of meanings or the measurement of the difference between words and longer texts. Users can compare a simple query to a large database of texts, locating texts containing similar meanings and ranking them according to their similarity.

==Uses==
In addition to measuring the similarity between words, sentences, or texts written in natural language, semantic searching can also distill the meanings of a set of texts and then provide comparative information about those meanings. Users enter a word or phrase which represents a subject for which similar related information is required. Possible typical applications would be for comparing reports, minutes of meetings, insurance claims, medical histories, research papers, and legal decisions from many court cases.

==Versions==
Distinguo is a [[C++]] Application Programming Interface ([[API]]), in two different applications:

'''Distinguo Index''': a tool for expanding search keywords to include inflected forms, synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, and other words related by meaning.

'''Distinguo Context''': a tool for analyzing the meaning of full sentences or even of full texts; it can then match this text with other texts containing the same or similar ideas.

They are delivered for integration into other solutions. Distinguo tools are supplied as  C++ libraries, and can be integrated into software solutions for its own features, or to supplement or refine statistical search methods.

The result of the syntactic analysis, as well as the format of the ontologies, is represented in [[XML]]. The calculation of semantic similarities may be in the form of a numerical coefficient, or an ontology showing the information present in the first ontology and missing in the second. The format of the texts and of the XML is a string of characters in the programming language 'C'.

==Development==
Distinguo Index and Distinguo Context are based on algorithms for the parsing of language and the matching and ranking semantic results developed by Semantica Software of Luxembourg in association with [[Ultralingua]] and is in  constant further research and development. Other uses could be integrated into electronic dictionary or phrasebook  applications.

'''doctest''' is a module included in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language's standard library that allows the easy generation of tests based on output from the standard Python interpreter shell, cut and pasted into [[docstring]]s.

==Implementation specifics==

Doctest makes innovative{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} use of the following Python capabilities:&lt;ref name="TimPeters"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/1c57cfb7b3772763 docstring-driven testing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[docstring]]s
* The Python interactive shell, (both command line and the included idle application).
* Python introspection

When using the Python shell, the primary prompt: &gt;&gt;&gt; , is followed by new commands. The secondary prompt: ... , is used when continuing commands on multiple lines; and the result of executing the command is expected on following lines.
A blank line, or another line starting with the primary prompt is seen as the end of the output from the command.

The doctest module looks for such sequences of prompts in a docstring, re-executes the extracted command and checks the output against the output of the command given in the docstrings test example.

The default action when running doctests is for no output to be shown when tests pass. This can be modified by options to the doctest runner. In addition, doctest has been integrated with the Python unit test module allowing doctests to be run as standard unittest testcases. Unittest testcase runners allow more options when running tests such as the reporting of test statistics such as tests passed, and failed.

==[[Literate programming]] and doctests==

Although doctest does not allow a Python program to be embedded in narrative text, it does allow for verifiable examples to be embedded in docstrings, where the docstrings can contain other text. Docstrings can in turn be extracted from program files to generate documentation in other formats such as HTML or PDF. 
A program file can be made to contain the documentation, tests, as well as the code and the tests easily verified against the code. This allows code, tests, and documentation to evolve together.

==Documenting libraries by example==

Doctests are well suited to provide an introduction to a library by demonstrating how the API is used.

On the basis of the output of Python's interactive interpreter, text can be mixed with tests that exercise the library, showing expected results.

==Examples==

Example one shows how narrative text can be interspersed with testable examples in a docstring. 
In the second example, more features of doctest are shown, together with their explanation. 
Example three is set up to run all doctests in a file when the file is run, but when imported as a module, the tests will not be run.

=== Example 1: A doctest embedded in the docstring of a function ===
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def list_to_0_index(lst):
    """A solution to the problem given in:
    http://rgrig.blogspot.com/2005/11/writing-readable-code.html
    
    'Given a list, lst, say for each element the 0-index where it appears for
    the first time. So the list x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2] is
    transformed into y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]. Notice that for all
    i we have x[y[i]] = x[i]. Use any programming language and any data
    representation you want.'
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list_to_0_index(x)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    """
    
    return [lst.index(i) for i in lst]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example 2: doctests embedded in a README.txt file ===

&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
======================
Demonstration doctests
======================

This is just an example of what a README text looks like that can be used with
the doctest.DocFileSuite() function from Python's doctest module.

Normally, the README file would explain the API of the module, like this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
3

Notice, that we just demonstrated how to add two numbers in Python, and 
what the result will look like.

A special option allows you to be somewhat fuzzy about your examples:

&gt;&gt;&gt; o = object()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o                 # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
&lt;object object at 0x...&gt;

Exceptions can be tested very nicely too:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example 3: unique_words.py ===
This example also simulates input to the function from a file by using the Python StringIO module
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def unique_words(page):
  ''' Returns set of the unique words in list of lines of text

    Example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from StringIO import StringIO
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fileText = """the cat sat on the mat
    ... the mat was ondur the cat
    ... one fish two fish red fish
    ... blue fish
    ... This fish has a yellow car
    ... This fish has a yellow star"""
    &gt;&gt;&gt; file = StringIO(fileText)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; page = file.readlines()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; words = unique_words(page)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print sorted(list(words))
    ["This", "a", "blue", "car", "cat", "fish", "has", "mat", 
     "on", "ondur", "one", "red", "sat", "star", "the", "two", 
     "was", "yellow"]
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
  '''

  return set(word  for line in page  for word in line.split())

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

&lt;/source&gt;

== Doctest and documentation generators ==

Both the EpyText format of [[Epydoc]] and Docutils' [[reStructuredText]] format support the markup of doctest sections within docstrings.

== Implementation in other programming languages ==

In C++, the doctest framework is the closest possible implementation of the concept - tests can be written directly in the production code with minimal overhead and the option to strip them from the binary.&lt;ref name="C++ github.com/onqtam/doctest"&gt;
[https://github.com/onqtam/doctest C++ github.com/onqtam/doctest]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ExUnit.DocTest [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]] library implements functionality similar to Doctest.&lt;ref name="Elixir ExUnit.DocTest"&gt;[https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.DocTest.html Elixir ExUnit.DocTest]&lt;/ref&gt;

An implementation of Doctest for [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].&lt;ref name="Haskell github.com/sol/doctest"&gt;[https://github.com/sol/doctest Haskell github.com/sol/doctest]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drive testing''' is a method of measuring and assessing the coverage, capacity and [[Quality of service|Quality of Service]] (QoS) of a mobile radio network.

The technique consists of using a motor vehicle containing [[Mobile radio|mobile radio network]] [[air interface]] measurement equipment that can detect and record a wide variety of the physical and virtual parameters of mobile cellular service in a given geographical area.

By measuring what a wireless network subscriber would experience in any specific area, wireless carriers can make directed changes to their networks that provide better coverage and service to their customers.

Drive testing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-testing.com/index.php/vitrogis|title=Official website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Drive testing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires a mobile vehicle outfitted with drive testing measurement equipment. The equipment are usually highly specialized electronic devices that interface to OEM mobile handsets. This ensures measurements are realistic and comparable to actual user experiences.

==Data collected during drive testing==
Drive test equipment typically collects data relating to the network itself, services running on the network such as voice or data services, radio frequency scanner information and GPS information to provide location logging.

The data set collected during drive testing field measurements can include information such as:&lt;ref&gt;Drive testing for LTE&lt;/ref&gt;

*Signal intensity
*Signal quality
*Interference
*Dropped calls
*Blocked calls
*Anomalous events
*Call statistics
*Service level statistics
*Quality of Service information
*Handover information
*Neighboring cell information
*GPS location co-ordinates

==Types of drive testing==
Drive testing can broadly be categorized into three distinct topics:

*Network benchmarking.
*Optimization and troubleshooting
*Service quality monitoring.

The result produced by drive testing for each of these purposes is different.

===Network benchmarking===
For benchmarking, sophisticated multi-channel tools such as Focus Infocom's DMTS and XGMA, DingLi Communications' Pilot Fleet, [[Ascom (company)|Ascom]]'s Symphony, [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]]-[[SwissQual]]'s Diversity Benchmarker or [[Keysight]] Nemo Invex II are used to measure several network technologies and service types simultaneously to very high accuracy, to provide directly comparable information regarding competitive strengths and weaknesses. Results from benchmarking activities,such a comparative coverage analysis or comparative data network speed analysis, are frequently used in marketing campaigns. Drive testing to gather network bench-marking data is the only way mobile network operators can collect accurate competitive data on the true level of their own and their competitors technical performance and quality levels.

===Optimization and troubleshooting===
Optimization and troubleshooting information is more typically used to aid in finding specific problems during the rollout phases of new networks or to observe specific problems reported by consumers during the operational phase of the network lifecycle. In this mode drive testing data is used to diagnose the root cause of specific, typically localized, network issues such as dropped calls or missing neighbour cell assignments.

===Service quality monitoring===
Service quality monitoring typically involves making test calls across the network to a fixed test unit to assess the relative quality of various services using [[Mean Opinion Scores|Mean opinion score]] (MOS). Quality monitoring focuses on the end user experience of the service, and allows mobile network operators to react to what effectively subjective quality degradations by investigating the technical cause of the problem in time-correlated data collected during the drive test. Service quality monitoring is typically carried out in an automated fashion, using devices that run largely without human intervention carried in vehicles that regularly ply typical drive testing routes such as garbage collection vehicles, taxis or buses.

Drive testing can be conducted at any time on a live network and very rarely will there be any network intrusion.

      <comment>/* EPSS versus training */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11301">{{more footnotes|date=May 2011}}
An '''electronic performance support system''' (EPSS) is any computer software program or component that improves user performance.

EPSSs can help an organization to reduce the cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance. They can [[Empowerment|empower]] employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or [[training]]. By using this type of system an employee, especially a new employee, will often not only be able to complete his or her work more quickly and accurately, but, as a secondary benefit, will also learn more about the job and the employer's business.

An EPSS is best considered when
*workers require knowledge to achieve individual performance in a business environment 
*skilled performers are spending a lot of time helping less skilled performers
*new workers must begin to perform immediately and training is impractical, unavailable or constrained
*employees need to be guided through a complex process or task that cannot be memorized.
These situations often occur when new systems (e.g. [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]]) are introduced, upgraded or consolidated, and in certain [[call centres]] when agents must perform using complex systems, processes or products.

==Components==
There are different views about the components and characteristics of EPSS. For example, from Barker and Banerji’s (1995) point of view, an EPSS has four functional levels, which should be brought together:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DESIGNING ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS|author=Philip Barker and Ashok Banerji|journal= Innovations in Education and Training International, Special Edition on Electronic Performance Support Systems|pages=4-12|volume=32|issue=1|year=1995|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a746782853}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the user interface shell (the human computer interface) and the database
#generic tools (help system, documentation, text retrieval system, intelligent agents, tutoring facility, simulation tools and communication resources)
#application-specific support tools
#a target application domain (schools, particular business settings, military, etc.).

== Advantages ==

#Reducing the complexity or number of steps required to perform a task
#Providing the performance information an employee needs to perform a task
#Providing a [[decision support system]] that enables an employee to identify the action that is appropriate for a particular set of conditions

== Definitions ==

In ''Electronic Performance Support Systems'', [[Gloria Gery]] defined EPSS as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic Performance Support Systems|year=1991|author=[[Gloria Gery]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Performance-Support-System-Gloria/dp/0961796812|isbn=978-0-9617968-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily &lt;br /&gt;
accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate, individualized &lt;br /&gt;
on-line access to the full range of information, software, guidance, advice and &lt;br /&gt;
assistance, data, images, tools, and assessment and monitoring systems to permit &lt;br /&gt;
[[job performance]] with minimal support and intervention by others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, in 1991, [[Barry Raybould]] gave a shorter definition:&lt;ref&gt;''An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer'', Barry Raybould. 1991, Ariel PSS Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a business perspective, a former [[Nortel Networks]] executive, [[William Bezanson]] (2002) provided a definition linked to application usability and organizational results:&lt;ref name=bezanson&gt;''Performance Support Solutions: Achieving Goals Through Enabling User Performance''. William Bezanson, 2002, Trafford Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A performance support system provides just-in-time, just enough training, information, tools, and help for users of a product or work environment, to enable optimum performance by those users when and where needed, thereby also enhancing the performance of the overall business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== EPSS versus online help ==

An EPSS must be distinguished from a traditional [[online help]] system. Online help usually supports a single software application and is not necessarily focused on the entire range of job tasks (which may involve multiple applications), but just that specific software. With online help, cross-referencing is often not available and the information provided is limited and rarely combined with procedures or complex tasks. Perhaps most critically, on-line help cannot be customized to the user or the job task; in fact, the same software screen may require different inputs depending on the user and job task. Online help is also not [[Context-sensitive help|contextual]] to the user's current situation and requires users to search through for the solution to their problem. 

== EPSS versus e-learning simulations ==

EPSS must also be differentiated from [[e-learning]] [[simulation]]s that replay a series of steps on-demand within a software application. Simulations are more closely associated with on-demand training, not [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] support, because of the longer time considerations, complexity, and media restrictions for playing a simulation. An EPSS can be considered a part of the [[e-learning]] category, as it is on-demand learning, and notes that the EPSS modality fits more within the informal learning definition.

== EPSS versus knowledge management ==

In his book, Bezanson points out that "[[knowledge management]]" is the noun corresponding to the verb of "performance support".&lt;ref name=bezanson/&gt; The knowledge documented in the system plays a critical role in any EPSS system. This concept was originated by Raybould (1997)&lt;ref&gt;''The Five Phases of Migration from Training to Knowledge Management'', Barry Raybould,  CBT Solutions July/August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; who separates out the repository, delivery and infrastructure aspects of the EPSS from the knowledge base it contains. In fact, Bezanson emphasizes the advantage that an LMS ([[learning management system]]) will interface with the EPSS to supply the knowledge base, content-courseware, or other tracking capabilities that an EPSS may require if the LMS precedes the implementation of the EPSS.

== EPSS versus training ==

EPSS's role in the future of [[training]] and work have been noted by followers of the trend towards more [[informal learning]] systems driven by knowledge management systems.
[[Tony O'Driscoll]] (1999) summarizes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; As the pace of technological change speeds up, many jobs will require constant adaptation, because of new information and new task requirements. In this context, the distinction between learning and work will disappear. A trend toward integrating training with on-the-job activities will be a result. This trend will extend itself to the point that training, as a distinct function, will no longer be the primary learning vehicle for many types of jobs. Works will use on-the-job information systems instead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this day, analysts such as [[Forrester Research|Forrester]]'s [[Claire Schooley]] and [[Bersin &amp; Associates]]' Chris Howard write similarly themed articles based on their research in informal learning, technology and training.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">''Electronic serial numbers'' (''ESNs'') were created by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to uniquely identify [[mobile devices]], from the days of [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] in the United States starting in the early 1980s. The administrative role was taken over by the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] in 1997 and is still maintained by them. ESNs are currently mainly used with [[CDMA]] phones (and were previously used by [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] and [[digital AMPS|TDMA]] phones), compared to [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI) numbers used by all [[GSM]] phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/resources/esn/index.cfm Electronic serial numbers (ESNs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 8 bits of the ESN were originally the manufacturer code, leaving 24 bits for the manufacturer to assign up to 16,777,215 codes to mobiles. To allow more than 256 manufacturers to be identified, the manufacturer code was extended to 14 bits, leaving 18 bits for the manufacturer to assign up to 262,144 codes. Manufacturer code 0x80 is reserved from assignment and is used instead as an 8-bit prefix for pseudo-ESNs (pESN). The remaining 24 bits are the least significant bits of the [[Sha-1|SHA-1]] hash of a [[mobile equipment identifier]] (MEID). Pseudo-ESNs are not guaranteed to be unique (the MEID is the unique identifier if the phone has a pseudo-ESN).

ESNs are often represented as either 11-digit decimal numbers or 8 digit hexadecimal numbers.  For the decimal format the first three digits are the decimal representation of the first 8 bits (between 00 and 255 inclusive) and the next 8 digits are derived from the remaining 24 bits and will be between 0000000 and 16777215 inclusive.  The decimal format of pseudo ESNs will therefore begin with 128. The decimal format separately displays 8 bit manufacturer codes in the first 3 digits, but 14 bit codes are not displayed as separate digits. The hexadecimal format displays an ESN as 8 digits and also does not separately display 14 bit manufacturer codes which occupy 3.5 hexadecimal digits.

As ESNs have essentially run out, a new serial number format, [[MEID]], was created by [[3GPP2]] and was first implemented by Verizon in 2006. MEIDs are 56 bits long, the same length as the IMEI and, in fact, MEID was created to be a superset of IMEI. The main difference between MEID and IMEI is that the MEID allows hexadecimal digits while IMEI allows only decimal digits – "IMEI shall consist of decimal digits (0 through 9) only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/23003.htm 3GPP TS 23.003, V9.0.0, 2009–09]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of the previously unused ESN codes were allocated in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tiaonline.org/standards_/resources/esn/documents/esn_meid_milestones_timeline.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420065338/https://www.tiaonline.org/standards_/resources/esn/documents/esn_meid_milestones_timeline.pdf |date=April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for assignments were accepted until June 30, 2010 using reclaimed ESN codes, those previously assigned to [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] or [[digital AMPS|TDMA]] phones and therefore not present on [[CDMA2000]] systems. Reclaimed codes have also been used for [[UIMID]] assignments. Codes are assigned according to industry guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tiaonline.org/standards/resources/esn/documents/ESN_Guidelines_v1.9c.pdf ESN Assignment Guidelines and Procedures, Version 1.9c. May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ESN assignments may still occur in the future based on applications received before June 30, 2010, there have not been any assignments made since December 31, 2010.

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Current status of girls and women in STEM education ==

=== Overall trends in STEM education ===
[[File:Percentage of students that take advanced courses in mathematics and physics, by sex, Grade 12.svg|thumb|440x440px|Percentage of students that take advanced courses in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], by sex, Grade 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced|title=TIMSS Advanced 2015 International Results in Advanced Mathematics and Physics|last=Mullis, I.

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Central [[Asia]], and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement, Curriculum and Instruction|last=Mullis, I.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars.

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G.

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{For|how-to guides on Wikipedia processes and practices|:Category:Wikipedia how-to{{!}}Category:Wikipedia how-to}}
{{For|the YouTube channel|HowToBasic}}
A '''how-to''' is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish a specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.

One of the earliest how-to books was published in 1569 and entitled, ''A booke of the arte and maner, how to plant set Up intro an divers other new practise, by one of the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Fraunce'' by [[Leonard Mascall]].'' 

Perhaps the best known full-length book in the genre is ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', written by [[Dale Carnegie]] in 1936.

A similar concept can be seen in many of the ''[topic] For Dummies'' series of tutorials and also in many other introductory surveys entitled with the suffix "[[101 (number)|101]]" (based on academic numberings of entry-level courses).

==Usage in the world of computers==
It is common practice to write the phrase as "HOWTO" in the open-source community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html List of Linux HowTos], tldp.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the traditional naming scheme for technical documentation, such as [[FAQ]] and [[README]]. Another possible reason is that this makes it easier to find a how-to in search engines like [[Google]] as searching with the words "to" and "how" does not necessarily deliver relevant search results.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2009 A Google search for "How To" results in a comprehensive list of HowTo sites. It seems this has changed throughout the years. In the 1990s and early years of 2000, it was common for search engines to ignore these words, and even to notify the user that these words are too common for giving a comprehensive result. Currently, [https://www.google.com/help/features.html the Google features web page] says: Google ignores common words and characters such as where, the, how, and other digits and letters that slow down your search without improving the results. If a common word is essential to getting the results you want, you can make sure we pay attention to it by putting a "+" sign in front of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

How-tos have a long history as a way of sharing knowledge on the [[Internet]], but are less successful than [[FAQ]]s, manuals, [[recipe]]s and [[guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A search on [[Google]] for "howto faq" or for "faq howto" results in FAQs with HowTo instructions in them, but never to a single HowTo page. This is probably because FAQ pages are usually broader in scope, and therefore more commonly used.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, most how-tos on the Internet were the result of a complex process in which an author wrote a how-to for potential readers. After 2001, [[user added content]] played a more and more important role on the internet in a trend that is widely referred to{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as [[Web 2.0]]. This had a profound impact on the way in which how-tos are generated on the internet, as the readers and users were able to add to and improve the on-line content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3367">ISO 24617-1:2009, '''ISO-TimeML''' is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO/TC37]] standard for time and event markup and annotation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N385_wg2_iso-timeml_provo2007_beamer_utf8.pdf. Retrieved 2010-5-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The scope is standardization of principles and methods relating to the annotation of temporal events in the contexts of electronic documentation and language.

==Objectives of ISO-TimeML==
The goals of ISO-TimeML are to provide a common model for the creation and use of temporal and event annotation, as a means of managing time-related data within documents, and to enable later categorization and data extraction with use of this meta-data.

==History of ISO-TimeML==
ISO-TimeML was presented to the ISO for consideration as a standard in August 2007. In this presentation, the preliminaries of ISO-TimeML were outlined, and potential applications were examined.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N385_wg2_iso-timeml_provo2007_beamer_utf8.pdf. Retrieved 2010-5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, revisions were made to ISO-TimeML as the standard transitioned from a New Project (NP) to a Working Project (WP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N471_rev01_SemAFTime_meetingNotes_Marrakech2008.pdf|title=Invincible Internet Security - Internet Addiction|author=|date=|website=www.tc37sc4.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO-TimeML voting period began in October 2008 and was approved as an international standard by March 2009.

==Current stage==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==ISO-TimeML as one of the members of the ISO/TC37 family of standards==

The ISO/TC37 standards are currently elaborated as high level [[specifications]] and deal with [[word segmentation]] (ISO 24614), [[annotations]] (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), [[feature structures]] (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and [[lexicons]] (ISO 24613 a.k.a. [[Lexical Markup Framework|LMF]]). These standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of [[ISO 12620]]), [[language codes]] ([[ISO 639]]), [[scripts codes]] ([[ISO 15924]]), [[country codes]] ([[ISO 3166]]) and [[Unicode]] ([[ISO 10646]]).

The two level organization forms a coherent family of standards with the following common and simple rules:
* the high level specification provides structural elements that are adorned by the standardized constants;
* the low level specifications provide standardized constants as metadata.

==Work group members==
Joint work between ISO/TC 37/SC 4/WG 2 (TDG 3) and the TimeML
Working Group that was agreed on at the TDG 3 and LIRICS Working Group
Meeting, USC/ISI, Marina del Rey, CA, U.S.A., 2006-04-20/21/22.

==Early life and education==
Holdren was born in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[San Mateo, California]].&lt;ref name=belfer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18738/harvard_kennedy_schools_john_p_holdren_named_obamas_science_advisor.html?breadcrumb=%252Ftopic%252F64%252Fscience_and_technology%253Fpage%253D4|title=Harvard Kennedy School's John P.

==Career==
Holdren taught at Harvard for 13 years and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; His work has focused on the causes and consequences of global [[environmental change]], population control, energy technologies and [[energy policy|policies]], ways to reduce the dangers from [[nuclear weapons]] and materials, and science and [[technology policy]].&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He has also taken measures to contextualize the United State's current energy challenge, noting the role that nuclear energy could play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Amy |last=Marcott |title=Science Advisor John Holdren ’65, SM ’66 Contextualizes Energy Challenge |url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2010/10/26/science-advisor-john-holdren-%e2%80%9965-sm-%e2%80%9966-contextualizes-energy-challenge/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201095534/http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2010/10/26/johnholdren/ |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |work=Slice of MIT |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was involved in the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]] in 1980. He, along with two other scientists helped [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] establish the bet with [[Julian Simon]], in which they bet that the price of five key metals would be higher in 1990. The bet was centered around a disagreement concerning the future scarcity of resources in an increasingly polluted and heavily populated world. Ehrlich and Holdren lost the bet, when the price of metals had decreased by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was chair of the Executive Committee of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] from 1987 until 1997 and delivered the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture on behalf of Pugwash Conferences in December 1995. From 1993 until 2003, he was chair of the [[Committee on International Security and Arms Control]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan National Committee on Energy Policy from 2002 until 2007. Holdren was elected [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) (2006–2007), and served as board Chairman (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He was the founding chair of the advisory board for ''[[Innovations (journal)|Innovations]]'', a quarterly journal about entrepreneurial solutions to global challenges published by MIT Press, and has written and lectured extensively on the topic of [[global warming]].

Holdren served as one of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s science advisors (PCAST) from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Eight years later, President Barack Obama nominated Holdren for the position of science advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in December 2008, and he was [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] on March 19, 2009, by a unanimous vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff and news service reports.

===Writings===
[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] was an early concern and interest. In a 1969 article, Holdren and co-author [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] argued, "if the population control measures are not initiated immediately, and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPanaceas"&gt;Paul R. Erlich and John P. Holdren. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1294858 "Population and Panaceas A Technological Perspective"], ''Bioscience'', Vol 19, pages 1065-1071, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Holdren encouraged a decline in fertility to well below replacement in the United States, because "210 million now is too many and 280 million in 2040 is likely to be much too many."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPredicament"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7jjp9bv0qNYC&amp;dq=no+growth+society&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA31,M1 | journal = Daedalus, the No-Growth Society | year = 1973 | title = Population and the American Predicament: The Case Against Complacency | first = John P. | isbn = 978-0-7130-0136-5 | last = Holdren | pages = 31&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Paul R.

'''Kinescope''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|ᵻ|s|k|oʊ|p}}, shortened to '''kine''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|iː}}, also known as '''telerecording''' in Britain, is a recording of a television program on motion picture film, directly through a lens focused on the screen of a [[Display device|video monitor]]. The process was pioneered during the 1940s for the preservation, re-broadcasting and sale of television programmes before the use of commercial broadcast-quality [[videotape]] became prevalent for these purposes.

Typically, the term can refer to the process itself, the equipment used for the procedure (a [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] or [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[movie camera]] mounted in front of a video monitor, and synchronized to the monitor's scanning rate), or a film made using the process. Kinescopes were the only practical way to preserve [[live television]] broadcasts prior to the introduction of [[videotape]] in 1956. A small number of theatrically released feature films have also been produced as kinescopes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The term ''kinescope'' originally referred to the [[cathode ray tube]] used in [[television receiver]]s, as named by inventor [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 84. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the recordings were known in full as '''kinescope films''' or '''kinescope recordings'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp; Popular Mechanics] April&amp;nbsp;1953&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Page 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bing1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/1960-series-game-found-in-bing-crosbys-wine-cellar/|title=1960 Series Game Found in Bing Crosby's Wine Cellar|author=David Morgan|website=[[CBS News]]|date=September 24, 2010|access-date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/training/?ID=19 Audio Engineering Society, Inc.] Retrieved October&amp;nbsp;29,&amp;nbsp;2015&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RCA was granted a trademark for the term (for its cathode ray tube) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;"RCA Surrenders Rights to Four Trade-Marks," Radio Age, October 1950, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The [[General Electric]] laboratories in [[Schenectady, New York]] experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Schenectady-to-Leipzig Television a Success; Movie Also Made of Images Sent by Radio", ''[[The New York Times]]'', Feb. 13, 1931, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence to suggest that the [[BBC]] experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. A BBC executive, [[Cecil Madden]], later recalled filming a production of ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' in this way, only for film director [[Alexander Korda]] to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book, which he felt had been infringed. However, the evidence for this is purely anecdotal, and indeed there is no written record of any BBC Television production of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' during the 1936–1939 period. The incident is, however, dramatised in [[Jack Rosenthal]]'s 1986 television play ''The Fools on the Hill''.

Some of the surviving live transmissions of the Nazi German television station [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow]], dating as far back as the 1930s, were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver's screen, although most surviving Nazi live television programs such as the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] (not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] for her film ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''), a number of [[Nuremberg Rally|Nuremberg Rallies]], or official state visits (such as [[Benito Mussolini]]'s) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal, with only a two minutes' delay from the original event, by means of the so-called ''Zwischenfilmverfahren'' (see [[intermediate film system]]) from an early [[production truck|outside broadcast van]] on the site.

According to a 1949 film produced by [[RCA]], silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s. The films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors - at a speed of eight frames per second, resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images. By the mid-1940s, RCA and [[NBC]] were refining the filming process and including sound; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-g-eB6Rjs  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707075015/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-g-eB6Rjs |date=July 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1946, television cameras were being attached to American guided missiles to aid in their remote steering.&lt;ref&gt;James L. H. Peck, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Doom on the Wing]", ''[[Popular Science]]'', February 1946, p. 84, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hCQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 Transatlantic Roller Coaster Designed to Bomb U.S.A.], ''Popular Science'', October 1947, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile's performance.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland, 2003, p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1220-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known surviving example of the telerecording process in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] is from October 1947, showing the singer [[Adelaide Hall]] performing at the RadiOlympia event.&lt;ref name=Shagawat&gt;{{cite web|last=Shagawat|first=Robert|title=Television recording - The origins and earliest surviving live TV broadcast recordings|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/tv_recordings_the_origins.html|work=Early Electronic Television|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|J16UHcWbjS8|"Adelaide Hall – Variety in Sepia – October 1947"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getty Images: [http://www.gettyimages.in/detail/nieuwsfoto's/the-first-radiolympia-since-the-war-30-september-1947-the-nieuwsfotos/102730194 A view of the "Cafe Continental" stage set] in the television studio at RadiOlympia Theatre, London, September 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall sings "[[Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba (My Bambino Go to Sleep)]]" and "[[I Can't Give You Anything But Love]]", as well as accompanying herself on ukulele and dancing. When the show was originally broadcast on [[BBC TV]] it was 60 minutes in length and also included performances from [[Winifred Atwell]], [[Evelyn Dove]], [[Cyril Blake]] and his Calypso Band, [[Edric Connor]] and [[Mable Lee]], and was produced by Eric Fawcett. The six-minute footage of Miss Hall is all that survives of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4177254/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt "Variety in Sepia (1947)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the following month, the [[wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh|wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip]] also survives, as do various early 1950s productions such as ''It is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer'', ''[[The Lady from the Sea (1953 TV film)|The Lady from the Sea]]'' and the opening two episodes of ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'', although in varying degrees of quality. A complete 7-hour set of telerecordings of Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] also exists. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Worldwide program distribution ===

In the era before satellite communications, kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the Commonwealth that had started a television service. A [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft would fly the telerecording from the UK to Canada, where it would be broadcast over the whole North American network.

Even after the introduction of videotape, the BBC and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales, and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in color. Most, if not all, videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of color. Consequently, the majority of British shows that still exist before the introduction of color, and a number thereafter, do so in the form of these telerecordings. A handful of shows, including some episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and most of the first series of ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'', were deliberately telerecorded for ease of editing rather than being videotaped.

=== Eastman Television Recording Camera ===

In September 1947, [[Eastman Kodak]] introduced the Eastman Television Recording Camera, in cooperation with [[Allen B. DuMont|DuMont Laboratories, Inc.]] and [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]], for recording images from a television screen under the trademark "Kinephoto". Prior to the introduction of [[videotape]] in 1956, kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts, or to distribute [[network television]] programs that were broadcast live from [[New York City|New York]] or other originating cities, to stations not connected to the network, or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast. Although the quality was less than desirable, [[television program]]s of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner.

NBC, [[CBS]], and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] set up their main kinescope recording facilities in New York City, while [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] chose [[Chicago]]. By 1951, NBC and CBS were each shipping out some 1,000 16mm kinescope prints each week to their [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s across the United States, and by 1955 that number had increased to 2,500 per week for CBS.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley S. Griswold, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=LiYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 Why TV Is Going Movie-Mad]", ''[[Popular Science]]'', February 1955, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1954 the television industry’s film consumption surpassed that of all of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_recording.htm |title=tvhandbook.com/History (recording) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603152849/http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_recording.htm |archivedate=2004-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="racetovideo"&gt;Wolpin, Stewart.

=== "Hot kinescope" ===

After the network of [[coaxial cable]] and [[Microwave radio relay|microwave relay]]s carrying programs to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] was completed in September 1951,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889197,00.html Coast to Coast]", ''Time'', August 13, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS and NBC instituted a "hot kinescope" process in 1952, where shows being performed in New York were transmitted west, filmed on two kinescope machines in 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative and 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[reversal film]] (the latter for backup protection) in Los Angeles, rushed to film processing, and then transmitted from Los Angeles three hours later for broadcast in the [[Pacific Time Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schneider, ''Jump Cut!: Memoirs of a Pioneer Television Editor'', McFarland, 1997, p. 23–32. {{ISBN|0-7864-0345-4}}. To save the time to make a print, the 35 mm negative was broadcast, and electronically converted to a positive image. The soundtrack for the 35 mm film was recorded on a separate 16 mm filmstrip, and synchronized at playback. The soundtrack for the 16 mm reversal film version was recorded on the same filmstrip as the image.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland, 2003, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1956, NBC began making color "hot kines" of some of its color programs using a [[Kodacolor (motion picture)|lenticular film process]] which, unlike color negative film, could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods.&lt;ref&gt;Showcase Productions, Inc.: ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'', [http://www.showcaseproductions.com/tech.htm Technical Considerations].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double system editing ===

Even after the introduction of [[Quadruplex videotape]] machines in 1956 removed the need for "hot kines", the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the "double system" method of videotape editing. It was impossible to slow or [[freeze frame television|freeze frame]] a videotape at that time, so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope, and edited conventionally. The edited kinescope print was then used to conform the videotape master. More than 300 videotaped network series and specials used this method over a 12-year period, including the fast-paced ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schneider, ''Jump Cut!: Memoirs of a Pioneer Television Editor'', McFarland, 1997, p. 105–106, 134–135. {{ISBN|0-7864-0345-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to kinescoping ==

With the variable quality of Kinescopes, networks looked towards alternative methods to replace them with a higher degree of quality.

=== Change to 35&amp;nbsp;mm film broadcasts ===

Programs originally shot with film cameras (as opposed to kinescopes) were also used in television’s early years, although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production "live" programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy.

In 1951, the stars and producers of the Hollywood-based television series ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Lucille Ball]], decided to film the show directly onto 35&amp;nbsp;mm film using the [[Multicamera setup|three-camera system]], instead of broadcasting it live. Normally, a live program originating from Los Angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the Eastern Time Zone, and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the Pacific Time Zone. But as an article in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' explained,
:In the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of [[Desilu Productions]] to put ''I Love Lucy'' on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network. The company was not satisfied with the quality of kinescopes. It saw that film, produced especially for television, was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Allen, "[http://www.lucyfan.com/filmingthe.html Filming the 'I Love Lucy' Show]", ''American Cinematographer'', January 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''I Love Lucy'' decision introduced [[reruns]] to most of the American television audience, and set a pattern for the [[Television syndication|syndication]] of TV shows after their network runs (and later, for first-run airings via syndication).

=== Electronicam ===
The program director of the [[DuMont Television Network]], James L. Caddigan, devised an alternative — the [[Electronicam]]. In this, all the studio TV cameras had built-in 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras which shared the same optical path.&lt;ref name="electronicam1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66|title=The History of Television, 1942 to 2000|author=Albert Abramson|page= 66|access-date=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically, identifying the camera "takes" called by the director. The corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program. The "Classic 39" syndicated episodes of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' were filmed using Electronicam&lt;ref name="electronicam1" /&gt; (as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series '' [[Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford|Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford At Home]]'' in 1954–55), but with the introduction of a practical [[videotape]] recorder only one year away, the Electronicam system never saw widespread use. The DuMont network did not survive into the era of videotape, and in order to gain clearances for its programs, was heavily dependent on kinescopes, which it called Teletranscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23|title=The History of Television, 1942 to 2000|author=Albert Abramson|page=23|access-date=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronovision===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

Attempts were made for many years to take television images, convert them to film via kinescope, then project them in theaters for paying audiences. In the mid-1960s, Producer/entrepreneur H. William "Bill" Sargent, Jr. used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units, shooting in the B&amp;W [[819-line]] interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal. The promotors of [[Electronovision]] (not to be confused with Electronicam) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless, the advances in picture quality were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used Marconi image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white "glow" around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was a defect of the pickup. Later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures.

=== Videotape ===

In 1951, singer [[Bing Crosby]]’s company [[Bing Crosby Enterprises]] made the first experimental magnetic [[video recording]]s; however, the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use. In 1956, [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] [[videotape]] recorder,&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt; followed in 1958 by a color model. Offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost, Quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts.&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt;

== Decline ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

U.S. television networks continued to make kinescopes of their daytime dramas available (many of which still aired live into the late 1960s){{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} as late as 1969 for their smaller network [[affiliates]] that did not yet have videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming. Some of these programs aired up to two weeks after their original dates, particularly in [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]. Many episodes of programs from the 1960s survive only through kinescoped copies. The last 16&amp;nbsp;mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s, as video tape recorders became more affordable.

In Australia, kinescopes were still being made of some evening news programs as late as 1977, if they were recorded at all. A recording of a 1975 episode of Australian series ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' is listed on the National Archives of Australia website as a kinescope,&lt;ref&gt;http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=8483962&lt;/ref&gt; while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series ''[[The Truckies]]'' also exist as kinescopes,&lt;ref&gt;https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=13352316&amp;isAv=Y&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the technology was still being used by [[ABC Television|ABC]] at that point.

In later years, film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality. While it is true that kinescopes did look inferior to live transmissions in the 1950s, it was due to the industry's technical limitations at that time. Even the best live transmission could look hazy by the time it reached the home viewer. Advances in broadcast technology soon allowed for a wider gray scale in black-and-white, and a fuller spectrum of colors, making kinescopes a perfectly viable commodity. This was demonstrated in the feature film ''Ten from Your Show of Shows'', a compilation of [[Sid Caesar]] kinescopes released to theaters. Reviewers were astonished at how good the kinescoped image looked on a large screen. Kinescopes have since lost their stigma of inferiority,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and are commonly consulted today for archival purposes.

Up until the early 1960s, much of the BBC's output, and British television in general, was broadcast live, and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings, which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time. In the UK, telerecordings continued to be made after the advent of commercial broadcast videotape from 1958 as they possessed several distinct advantages, particularly for overseas program sales. Firstly, they were cheaper,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} easier to transport and more durable than video. Secondly, they could be used in any country regardless of the television broadcasting standard, which was not true of videotape. Thirdly, the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color.

The telerecording system could be of a very high quality, easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture. One side effect of the system was that it removed the 'fluid' look of interlaced video and '[[filmizing|filmized]]' the picture.

The system was largely used for black and white reproduction. Although some color telerecordings were made, they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale, video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced. Before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s, any (color) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film.

In the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in Britain, allowing enthusiasts to make [[16 mm film]] recordings of television programs {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. The major drawback, apart from the short duration of a 16&amp;nbsp;mm film magazine, was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the TV set in order to block out any stray reflections, making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming. It is not known if any recordings made using this equipment still exist.

British broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s, with [[35 mm film|35 mm]] being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result. For overseas sales, 16&amp;nbsp;mm film would be used, as it was cheaper. Although domestic use of telerecording in the UK for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s, 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[black and white]] film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by British broadcasters well into the 1970s.

Telerecording was still being used internally at the [[BBC]] in the 1980s too, to preserve copies for posterity of programs which were not necessarily of the highest importance, but which nonetheless their producers wanted to be preserved. If there were no videotape machines available on a given day, then a telerecording would be made. There is evidence to suggest that the children's magazine program ''[[Blue Peter]]'' was occasionally being telerecorded as late as 1985. After this point, however, cheap domestic videotape formats such as [[VHS]] could more easily be used to keep a back-up reference copy of a program.

Another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16&amp;nbsp;mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work, although such use was again rare.

In other territories, film telerecordings were stopped being produced after the introduction of videotape. In Czechoslovakia, the first videotape recorders (Machtronics MVR-15) were introduced in 1966, but soon were replaced by the Ampex 2" Quadruplex in 1967. Most of the programs, like TV dramas, were recorded on video, but only a few programmes continued to be telerecorded onto 16mm film. The last telerecording was produced in 1969 and soon after all programmes were recorded on video only.

[[Image:Screenshot from 1949 Kinescope Recording (Fireball Fun for All).png|thumb|right|255px|Screenshot from 1949 kinescope]]
Kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast, or for an occasional repeat of a prerecorded program; thus, only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today. [[List of lost television broadcasts|Many television shows are represented by only a handful of episodes]], such as with the early television work of comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]], and the original version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' hosted by [[Art Fleming]].

Another purpose of Kinescopes involved satisfying show sponsors. Kinescopes sometimes would be sent to the advertising agency for the sponsor of a show so that the ad agency could determine whether or not the sponsor's ads appeared properly. Due to this practice, some kinescopes have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves.

Kinescopes were also used for some live television programs, like ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'', when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones.

===In Britain===
Telerecordings form an important part of British television heritage, preserving what would otherwise have been lost. Nearly every pre-1960s British television programme in the archives is in the form of a telerecording, along with the vast majority of existing 1960s output. Videotape was expensive and could be [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|wiped]] and re-used; film was cheaper, smaller, and in practice more durable. Only a very small proportion of British television from the black and white era survives at all; perhaps 5% from the 1953-58 period and 8-10% from the 1960s.

Many recovered programmes, particularly those made by the [[BBC]], have been returned as telerecordings by foreign broadcasters or private film collectors from the 1980s onwards, as the BBC has taken stock of the large gaps in its archive and sought to recover as much of the missing material as possible. Many of these surviving telerecorded programmes, such as episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' and ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' continue to be transmitted on [[satellite television]] stations such as [[UKTV Gold]], and many such programmes have been released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].

In late 2008 the BBC transmitted an episode of ''[[Dad's Army]]'' after the original colour had been restored to the only surviving [[Room at the Bottom#Colour restoration of the original television recording|monochrome film recording]] of ''[[Room at the Bottom]]''.

== Technology ==

[[NTSC]] television images are [[raster scan|scanned]] at roughly 60 [[Hertz|Hz]], with two [[interlaced]] [[field (video)|fields]] per frame, displayed at 30 [[frames per second]].

A kinescope must be able to:
#Convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s, the standard sound speed of film cameras,
#Do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a [[film chain]] back to 30 frame/s.

In kinescoping an NTSC signal, 525 lines are broadcast in one frame. A 35&amp;nbsp;mm or 16&amp;nbsp;mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television (525 lines), and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television (131.25 lines). In the British [[405-line television system]], the French [[Analog high-definition television system#French 819-line system|819-line television system]] and the European [[576i|625-line television system]], television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly, 50 fields—per second, so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames.

Therefore, in order to maintain successful kinescope photography, a camera must expose one frame of film for ''exactly'' 1/30th or 1/25th of a second, the time in which one frame of video is transmitted, and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120 of a second. In some instances, this was accomplished through means of an electronic shutter which cuts off the TV image at the end of every set of visible lines.

Most U.S. kinescope situations, however, utilized a mechanical shutter, revolving at 24 revolutions per second. This shutter had a closed angle of 72° and an open angle of 288°, yielding the necessary closed time of 1/120 of a second and open time 1/30 of a second. Using this shutter, in 1 second of video (60 fields equaling 30 frames), 48 television fields (totaling to 24 frames of video) would be captured on 24 frames of film, and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced.

Because television is a field- rather than frame-based system, however, not all the information in the picture can be retained on film in the same way as it can on videotape. The time taken physically to move the film on by one frame and stop it so that the gate can be opened to expose a new frame of film to the two [[field (video)|fields]] of television picture is much longer than the [[vertical blanking interval]] between these fields—so the film is still moving when the start of the next field is being displayed on the television screen. It is not possible to accelerate the film fast enough to get it there in time without destroying the [[film perforations|perforations]] in the [[film stock]]—and the larger the [[film gauge]] used, the worse the problem becomes.

The problem of adapting the way the image is either displayed or captured on film, to get around the above, was solved in various different ways as time went on—improving the quality of the image.

=== Shutter bar and banding problems ===

The 72°/288° shutter and the systematic loss of 12 fields per second were not without its side effects. In going from 30 frame/s to 24 frame/s, the camera photographed ''part'' of some fields. The juncture on the film frame where these part-fields met was called a "splice".

If the timing was accurate, the splice was invisible. However, if the camera and television were out of phase, a phenomenon known as "shutter bar" or "banding" took place. If the shutter was slow in closing, overexposure resulted where the part-fields joined and the "shutter bar" took the form of a white line. If the shutter closed too soon, underexposure took place and the line was black. The term "banding" referred to the phenomenon occurring on the screen as two bars.

=== Suppressed field ===

A simpler system less prone to breakdown was to suppress one of the two fields in displaying the television picture. This left the time in which the second field was displayed for the film camera to advance the film by one frame, which proved enough. This method was also called 'Skip field' recording.

This method had several disadvantages. In missing out every second field of video, half the information of the picture was lost on such recordings. The resulting film consisted of fewer than 200 lines of picture information and as a result the line structure was very apparent; the missing field information also made movement look very 'jerky'.

=== Stored field ===

A development on the suppressed field system was to display the image from one of the fields at a much higher intensity on the television screen during the time when the film gate was closed, and then capture the image as the second field was being displayed. By adjusting the intensity of the first field, it was possible to arrange it so that the luminosity of the phosphor had decayed to exactly match that of the second field, so that the two appeared to be at the same level and the film camera captured both.This method came to be preferred.

Another technique developed by the [[BBC]] known as 'spot wobble' involved the addition of an extremely high frequency but low voltage sine wave to the vertical deflection plate of the television screen, which changed the moving 'spot' through which the television picture was displayed into an elongated oval. While this made the image slightly blurred, it removed the visible line structure and resulted in a better image. It also prevented [[moiré pattern]]s appearing when the resulting film was re-broadcast on television and the lines of the recording did not match the scan lines.

=== Moye-Mechau film recording ===

The first successful procedure was to use the Mechau film projector mechanism in reverse. The Mechau system used a synchronised rotating mirror to display each frame of a film in sequence without the need for a [[Movie projector#Film gate and single image|gate]]. When reversed, a high-quality television monitor was set up in place of the projection screen, and unexposed film stock is run through at the point where the lamp was illuminating the film.

This procedure had the advantage of capturing both fields of the frame on a film, but it was difficult to keep the mirrors running at the right speed and all the equipment adjusted correctly, which often resulted in poor quality output. An additional problem was that the whole procedure took place in an open room and it was known for insects to settle on the screen which were then permanently present on the film recording. The Mechau film magazine only held enough for nine minutes so two recorders were needed to run in sequence in order to record anything longer.

=== Lenses for kinescoping ===

Lenses did not need a great depth of field, but had to be capable both of producing a very sharp image with high resolution of a flat surface and of doing so at high speed. In order to keep from light fall-off on the perimeter of the lens, a coated lens was preferable.  40&amp;nbsp;mm or 50&amp;nbsp;mm lenses were usually used with 16mm in calibrated mounts. Focus was checked by examining a print yielded under a microscope.

=== Magazines and film length ===

In order to record half-hour programs without interruption, magazines were designed which accommodated a load of 1,200 feet for 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. Stations recording on 35&amp;nbsp;mm utilized 6,000 foot magazines for one hour of continuous recording.

=== Sound recording ===

The camera could be equipped with sound recording to place the soundtrack and picture on the same film for single system sound recording. More commonly, the alternative double system, whereby the soundtrack was recorded on an optical recorder or magnetic dubber in sync with the camera, yielded a better quality sound track and greatly facilitated editing.

=== Kinescope image ===

Kinescope tubes intended for photographic use were coated with phosphors rich in blue and ultra-violet radiations. This permitted the use of positive type emulsions for photographing in spite of their slow film speeds. The brightness range of kinescope tubes were about 1 to 30.

Kinescope images were capable of great flexibility. The operator could make the image brighter or darker, adjust contrast, width and height, turn left, right or upside down, and positive or negative.

Since kinescopes were able to produce a negative picture, direct positive recordings could be made by simply photographing a negative image on the kinescope tube. When making a negative film, in order for final prints to be in the correct emulsion position, the direction of the image was reversed on the television. This applied only when double system sound was used.

=== Film stock used ===

For kinescopes, 16&amp;nbsp;mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing, but in the larger network markets, it was not uncommon to see 35&amp;nbsp;mm kinescopes, particularly for national rebroadcast. By law, all film supplied to TV stations, both 16&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm had to be on a non-flammable, safety film base.

For U.S. video recording, fine grain positive stock was the most common used because of its low cost and high resolution yield. Of the fine grain stocks, the following were recommended by film manufacturers:
* [[Ansco]]: Fine Grain Positive for Television Purposes, for making direct positive recordings with 16&amp;nbsp;mm kinescope cameras.
* [[DuPont]]: Fine Grain Master Positive Film Type 628A (16&amp;nbsp;mm) and 628B (35&amp;nbsp;mm).  Difference in contrast can be controlled in development.
* [[Eastman Kodak]]: Eastman Fine Grain Sound Recording Film, Type 5373 (low-contrast) for negative stock where other prints would be made.  Fine Grain Release Positive Film, Type 7302 (high-contrast) for direct positive recordings and single system sound recordings using variable area sound.

=== Common issues with kinescopes ===

Videotape engineer Frederick M. Remley&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/papers/remley.html Papers of Frederick M. Remley], University of Maryland Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote of kinescope recordings,
:Because of the many variables in the combined electronic/photographic process, the quality of such recordings often leaves much to be desired. Defects often encountered in photographic recording include relatively poor image resolution; a compressed brightness range often limited by kinescope display technology to a brightness ratio of about 40:1; nonlinearity of recordings, as exemplified by lack of gradation in both the near-white and near-black portions of the reproduced pictures; and excessive image noise due to film grain and video processing artifacts. The final [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is often less than 40 [[decibel|dB]], especially in the case of 16 mm film.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Magnetic Recording: The First Hundred Years'', IEEE Press, 1998, p. 128. {{ISBN|978-0-7803-4709-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because each field is sequential in time to the next, a kinescope film frame that captured two interlaced fields at once often showed a ghostly fringe around the edges of moving objects, an artifact not as visible when watching television directly at 50 or 60 fields per second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neuron2.net/LVG/interlacing.html Illustration of interlace fringing].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same [[frame rate]] of 30 full frames{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} per second, resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second. The standard was later changed for color TV to 59.94 fields/s. or 29.97 frame/s. when color TV was invented. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;If electrical interference was present in the old 30 frame/s, 60 fields/s black-and-white format, a shutter bar would appear horizontally across the screen and not move due to U.S. electrical standards having the same Hertz rate as the fields refresh rate in the picture. When color TV was standardized, the frame rate was shifted to 29.97 and the field rate shifted to 59.94 to allow a frequency shift not only to introduce the luminance/chrominance delay needed to share the information on the screen, but also to move the hum bar from a stationary position.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era of early color TV, the [[chrominance|chroma]] information included in the video signal filmed could cause [[chroma dots|visible artifacts]]. It was possible to filter the chroma out, but this was not always done. Consequently, the color information was included (but not in color) in the black &amp; white film image. Using modern computing techniques, the color may now be recovered, a process known as [[Colour recovery|color recovery]].

In recent years, the [[BBC]] has introduced a video process called ''[[VidFIRE]]'', which can restore kinescope recordings to their original frame rate by interpolating video fields between the film frames.

Certain performers or production companies would require that a kinescope be made of every television program. Such is the case with performers [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Milton Berle]], for whom nearly complete program archives exist. As Jackie Gleason’s program was broadcast live in New York, the show was kinescoped for later rebroadcast for the West Coast. Per his contract, he would receive one copy of each broadcast, which he kept in his vault, and only released them to the public (on home video) shortly before his death in 1987.

Milton Berle sued [[NBC]] late in his life, believing the kinescopes of a major portion of his programs were lost. However, the programs were later found in a warehouse in Los Angeles.

[[Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]], the producers of such TV game shows as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', had a significant portion of their output recorded on both videotape and kinescopes. These programs are rebroadcast on the American cable TV’s [[Game Show Network]].

All of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] telecasts with [[Arturo Toscanini]], from 1948 to 1952, were preserved on kinescopes and later released on VHS and [[laser disc|LaserDisc]] by [[RCA]] and on DVD by [[Testament Records (UK)|Testament]]. The original audio from the kinescopes, however, was replaced with [[high fidelity]] sound that had been recorded simultaneously either on transcription discs or [[magnetic tape]].

In the mid-90s, [[Edie Adams]], wife of Ernie Kovacs, claimed that so little value was given to the kinescope recordings of the [[DuMont Television Network]] that after the network folded in 1956 its entire archive was dumped into upper New York bay. Today however, efforts are made to preserve the few surviving DuMont kinescopes, with the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] having collected over 300 for preservation.

In September 2010, a kinescope of game 7 of the [[1960 World Series]] was found in the wine cellar of Bing Crosby.&lt;ref name="bing1" /&gt; The game was thought lost forever, but was preserved due to Crosby's superstition about watching the game live.&lt;ref name="bing1" /&gt; The film was transferred to DVD{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} and was broadcast on the [[MLB Network]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="bing1" /&gt;

Because [[videotape]] records at fifty [[interlaced]] fields per second and telerecordings at twenty-five progressive frames per second, videotaped programmes that exist now only as telerecordings have lost their characteristic "live video" look and the motion now looks filmic.  One solution to this problem is [[VidFIRE]], an electronic process to restore video-type motion.

Early Australian television drama series were recorded as kinescopes, such as ''[[Autumn Affair]]'' and ''[[Emergency (1959 TV series)|Emergency]]'', along with variety series like ''[[The Lorrae Desmond Show]]''. Kinescopes continued to be made after video-tape was introduced to Australia; most existing episodes of the 1965-1967 children's series ''[[Magic Circle Club]]'' are kinescopes (per listings for episodes on National Film and Sound Archive website)

== Cameras ==

=== Rangefinder film cameras ===
Seiki Kogaku (now Canon) began to develop and subsequently to produce rangefinder cameras with the Kwanon prototype in 1933, based on the Leica II 35mm camera, with separate rangefinder and view finder systems (3 windows). Production began with the Hansa Canon on the Leica III format through WWII.  Post war Canon resumed production of pre-war designs in early 1946 with the JII viewfinder and the S1 rangefinder.  But in late 1946 they introduced the SII which departed from the Leica design by offering a combined viewfinder/rangefinder system, reducing the windows on the front of the camera to two.  However, in most other respects these cameras remained visually similar to the Leica III.

* [[Kwanon]] (1933) Nippon Kogaku (now Nikon) provided Seiki Kogaku with funding, Nikkor lenses, rangefinders, and technical assistance
* [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] (1936) Known today as the "Original Canon" The viewfinder moved to the top of the camera, differing from the Leica
* [[Hansa Canon]] (1936) Omiya Trading Co marketed original Canon with the Hansa name above the Canon name on the top
* [[Canon S]] (1939) Standard model.  The word “Hansa” disappeared from the brand name, and was replaced with just “Canon” 
* [[Canon NS]] (1939) New Standard. A Canon S without the slow shutter speeds
* [[Canon J]] (1939) J stands for Junior a non-rangefinder model.
* [[Canon J II]] (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras
* [[Canon S]] (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras

* [[Canon II S2]] (1955)
* [[Canon II D2]] (1955)
* [[Canon II F2]] (1955)

In 1956, Canon departed from the Leica II Style and developed a more contemporary look, along with a Contax style self-timer level to the left of the lens mount.   This was the first Canon camera with a swing-open camera back for film loading. Upper end models had a new three-mode viewfinders and winding triggers.

==== [[Canon EE|EE]]-mount [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
In 1969 Canon introduced an economy camera/lens system where the rear three elements (in two groups) were built-on-to the camera, and several front element options could be interchanged.  This had been used by Zeiss-Ikon in their mid-level cameras of their Contaflex series, and by Kodak in early interchangeable lenses for the top-end Retina series (later going to full lenses).  Canon offered four lens options: 35mm f/3.5, 50mm f/1.8, 95mm f/3.5, and 1255mm f/3.5.

Through the lens metering was center weighted and automatic exposure was shutter speed priority.  Only two cameras were offered and the line was not successful.

* [[Canon EXEE]] (1969)
* [[Canon EX Auto]] (1972) improved auto flash features

==== [[Canon FD|FD]]-mount [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
Canon developed and produced the [[Canon FD]] [[lens mount]] standard for [[Photographic film|film]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[camera]]s from 1971 to replace the [[Canon FL|FL]] [[lens mount]] standard.
The FD mount had two variants&amp;nbsp;– original lenses used a breechlock collar to mount whilst later versions used a standard bayonet twist lock with a short twist action.
The EF [[lens mount]] standard superseded FD-mounts in 1987. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] ceased to produce [[Canon FD lens mount|FD]]-mount cameras in 1994.

==== [[Canon EOS|EOS]] ====
In 1987, Canon introduced the [[Canon EOS|EOS]] Single-lens reflex camera system along with the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF]] lens-mount standard to replace the 16-year-old [[Canon FD|FD]] lens-mount standard; EOS became the sole SLR camera-system used by Canon {{As of|2005|alt=today}}. Canon also used EOS for its [[Digital data|digital]] SLR cameras.   All current [[Photographic film|film]] and [[Digital data|digital]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] cameras produced by Canon {{As of|2005|alt=today}} use the [[Canon EOS|EOS]] [[autofocus]] system. Canon introduced this system in 1987 along with the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF]] [[lens mount]] standard. The last non-EOS based SLR camera produced by Canon, the [[Canon T90]] of 1986,  is widely regarded as the template for the EOS line of camera bodies, although the T90 employed the older [[Canon FD|FD]] lens-mount standard.

====NoteJet====
Beginning in Spring 1993, Canon produced a series of notebooks with integrated inkjet printers called NoteJet. The initial price for the first-model NoteJet was U.S. $2,499.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Peter H. |title=Canon laptop has a built-in ink-jet printer |publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=1993-04-19 |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-04-19/business/1993109128_1_printer-and-computer-office-printers-ink-jet-printer |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NoteJet lineup was eventually discontinued, and computers belonging to the series are valued by collectors.

== Printers ==
Canon printers are supplied with Canon Advanced Printing Technology (CAPT), a printer driver software-stack developed by Canon. The company claims that its use of [[data compression]] reduces their printer's memory requirement, good quality compared to conventional laser printers, and also claim that it increases the [[Bit rate|data transfer rate]] when printing high-resolution graphics.&lt;ref&gt;

=== [[Canon PIXMA Series|PIXMA series]] ===
Since about 2005 Canon introduced a numbering scheme for some whereby the least significant (non-zero) digit signifies the geographic region (“3” signifying Japan) the device is sold in. This leads to a large number of models, all belonging to the same family, but possibly incompatible to some degree, and also makes it difficult to ascertain whether a device is unique or part of an existing family. The software driver filename will often use the family designation.

Some MP devices have fax capability (MP740).

== Lenses ==

''See [[Canon EF lens mount#List of EF lenses|Canon EF lenses]] for the product line-up''.
''See [[Canon EF-S lens mount#List of EF-S lenses|Canon EF-S lenses]] for the product line-up''.

EF-S lenses are built for APS-C 1.6x crop sensors, so it will only work with models that use this sensor size, such as: Canon EOS Digital Rebel series ([[Canon EOS 300D|300D]] through [[Canon EOS 750D|750D]] and [[Canon EOS 760D|760D]], [[Canon EOS 100D|100D]], and [[Canon EOS 1000D|1000D]] through [[Canon EOS 1200D|1200D]]), and newer cameras in the prosumer Canon EOS Digital series ([[Canon EOS 20D|20D]] through [[Canon EOS 80D|80D]], [[Canon EOS 20Da|20Da]], [[Canon EOS 60D#EOS 60Da|60Da]], [[Canon EOS 7D|7D]], and [[Canon EOS 7D Mark II|7D MkII]]). When EF-S lenses are used on a 35mm (full frame) camera, the back element will hit the mirror assembly or cause massive amounts of vignetting since the sensor is bigger than the image produced by the lens.

=== FD line ===
''See [[Canon FD#List of FD lenses|Canon FD lenses]] for the product line-up''.

=== FL line ===
''See [[Canon FL#FL lenses|Canon FL lenses]] for the product line-up''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4142">This is a partial list of text and image '''duplicating processes''' used in business and government from the [[Industrial Revolution]] forward.  Some are mechanical and some are chemical.  There is naturally some overlap with printing processes and photographic processes, but the challenge of precisely duplicating business letters, forms, contracts, and other paperwork prompted some unique solutions as well.  There were many short-lived [[invention]]s along the way.

==Duplicating processes==
''Within each type, the methods are arranged in very rough chronological order.''

* Methods of copying handwritten letters
** [[Manifold stylographic writer]], using early [[carbon paper|"carbonic paper"]]
** [[Letter copying book process]]
*Mechanical processes

*[[Printmaking]], which includes [[engraving]] and [[etching]]
**[[Relief print]]ing including [[woodcut]]
**[[Intaglio (printmaking)]] or copperplate engraving
**[[Planographic]] printing
**[[Line engraving]]

From February 1943 the US used a universal system to identify radar variants, consisting of three letters and a number, respectively designating platform, type of equipment, function, and version. This system was continued after WWII with multiservice designations being prefixed by 'AN/' for Army-Navy.

'''Location awareness''' refers to devices that can passively or actively determine their location. [[Navigational instrument]]s provide location coordinates for vessels and vehicles. Surveying equipment identifies location with respect to a well-known locationa [[wireless communications]] device. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) describes the location of a node in a network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blackviper.com/wiki/Network_Location_Awareness_%28NLA%29 Network location awareness]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740123%28VS.85%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The term applies to [[navigation|navigating]], [[location (geography)|real-time locating]] and positioning support with global, regional or local scope. The term has been applied to [[traffic]], [[logistics]], [[business administration]] and [[leisure]] applications. Location awareness is supported by [[Radar|navigation systems]], [[radar tracker|positioning systems]] and/or [[Real-time locating system|locating services]].

Location awareness without the active participation of the device is known as non-cooperative locating or detection.

== History of terminology ==
The term originated for [[configurations]] settings of [[computer network|network]] systems and addressed network entities. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) services collect network configuration and location information, and notify applications when this information changes. With the advent of [[global positioning system]]s and radio-equipped mobile devices, the term was redefined to include consumer-focused applications.

While location awareness began as a matter of static user location, the notion was extended to reflect movement. Context models have been proposed&lt;ref name="curino-context2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cristiana Bolchini and Carlo A. Curino and Elisa Quintarelli and Fabio A. Schreiber and Letizia Tanca |title=A data-oriented survey of context models |url=http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |format=PDF |journal=SIGMOD Rec. |volume=36 |issue=4 |year=2007 |issn=0163-5808 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.1145/1361348.1361353 |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424051627/http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support context-aware applications which use location to tailor interfaces, refine application-relevant data, increase the precision of information retrieval, discover services, make user interaction implicit and build smart environments. For example, a location-aware mobile phone may confirm that it is currently in a building.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999a"&gt;{{cite conference

==Variants==
"Crisp" locating offers precise coordinates, using wireless signals or optical sighting, possibly with phase angle measurements. Coordinates are relative to either a standardized system of coordinates, e.g. [[WGS84]], or a fixed object such as a building plan. [[Real-time locating system|Real-time locating]] adds timely delivery of results, especially for moving targets. Real time locating is defined with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1.&lt;ref name="malik2009"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy locating]] offers less precision, e.g., presence "near" a point of reference. Measuring wireless power levels can supply this degree of precision. Less sophisticated systems can use wireless distance measurements to estimate a point of reference in [[polar coordinate]]s (distance and direction) from another site. Index locating indicates presence at a known location, as with fixed [[RFID]] readers and RFID tags.&lt;ref name="sweeney2006"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Location-aware systems address the acquisition of coordinates in a grid (for example using distance metrics and lateration algorithms) or at least distances to reference points (for example discriminating presence at a certain choke point on a corridor or in a room of a building).&lt;ref name="schmidt2003phd"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navigation ===
[[Navigation]] and reckoning are key concerns for [[seafarer]]s, [[aviator]]s and professional drivers. The task is to dynamically determine the current location and the time, distance and direction to destination. [[radar]] served for regional demand and [[NAVSTAR]] satellite systems for global demand. [[GPS]] and similar systems have become ubituitous in long-haul transport operation and are  becoming a standard automobile feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 Test TomTom Navigator 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228155025/http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 |date=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveying ===
[[Surveying]] is the static complement to navigating. It is essential for delineating land ownership and for [[architect]]s and [[civil engineer]]s designing construction projects. Optical surveying technology preceded [[LASER]] [[triangulation|triangulating]] aids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf Das neue Messen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001918/http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business process ===
Currently location awareness is applied to design innovative [[process control]]s, and is integral to [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous]] and [[wearable computer|wearable computing]]. On mobile devices, location aware [[search algorithm|search]] can prioritize results that are close to the device. Conversely, the device location can be disclosed to others, at some cost to the bearer's privacy.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999b"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Warehouse and routing ===
RFID provides a time/location reference for an object, but does not indicate that the object remains at that location, which is sufficient for applications that limit access, such as tracking objects entering and leaving a warehouse, or for objects moving on a fixed route, such as charging tolls for crossing a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfid-basis.de/article-00146.html |title=Fünf Jahre nach dem RFID-Hype erste Ernüchterung |publisher=Rfid-basis.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosemann2006"&gt;{{cite conference

=== Consumer ===
Location awareness enables new applications for ubiquitous computing systems and [[mobile phone]]s. Such applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used (examples include [http://www.controlplaneapp.com ControlPlane] and [http://www.45rpmsoftware.com/locamatic.php Locamatic]), or publishing a user's location to appropriate members of a social network, and allowing retailers to publish special offers to potential customers who are near to the retailers. Allegedly, individuals gain [[self confidence]] with confirmation of current [[Tracking (Scouting)|whereabouts]].&lt;ref name="blank1989"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
While governments have created global systems for computing locations, independent localized systems exist at scales ranging from one building to sub-national regions.

=== Local ===
Such solutions may apply concepts of [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] and [[WPAN]], [[wireless LAN]] or [[DECT]], with results in proprietary terms of [[floor plan]]s or room numbers. Local systems degrade as distance from the locality increases. Applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used.

=== Regional ===
This approach uses for example mobile phone systems, such as [[3GPP]], [[GSM]] or [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], typically returning information in standardized coordinates as with WGS84 in standardized formats such as [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] for outdoor usage or in symbolic coordinates referring to street addresses.

=== Global ===
This approach relies on [[GPS]] technology, currently supplied by NAVSTAR and may in future employ the pending [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] system, generally adopting WGS84 and NMEA. Applications include [[Avalanche|avalanche rescue]] or [[emergency]] and [[mountain rescue]] as well as with [[search and rescue]], (SAR) and [[combat search and rescue]], (CSAR).

[[File:Luddite.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Leader of the Luddites'', engraving of 1812]]

The '''Luddites''' were a secret oath-based organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebaffler.com/latest/a-nod-to-ned-ludd|title=A nod to Ned Ludd|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[England|English]] textile workers in the 19th century, where a radical faction destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The group was protesting the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?no-ist=&amp;page=2|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Luddites feared correctly that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/who-were-the-luddites|title=Who were the Luddites? |newspaper=History.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a misconception that the Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt the progress of technology. Over time, however, the term has come to mean one opposed to [[industrialisation]], [[automation]], [[embedded computer system|computerisation,]] or new [[technology|technologies]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict&amp;field-12668446=luddite&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname "Luddite"] ''Compact Oxford English Dictionary'' at AskOxford.com. Accessed February 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Luddite movement began in [[Nottingham]] and culminated in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed with military force.

== Etymology ==

Although the origin of the name Luddite ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|d|.|aɪ|t}}) is uncertain, the movement was said to be named after [[Ned Ludd]], an apprentice who allegedly smashed two [[stocking frame]]s in 1779 and whose name had become emblematic of machine destroyers. Ned Ludd, however, was completely fictional and used as a way to shock and provoke the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205162901/http://www.leicesteruk.net/historydetail.php?id=13322&amp;f= Anstey at Welcome to Leicester (visitoruk.com)] According to this source, "A half-witted Anstey lad, Ned Ludlam or Ned Ludd, gave his name to the Luddites, who in the 1800s followed his earlier example by expressing violence against machinery in protest against the Industrial Revolution."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Roy, 1998, ''The Sound of History: Songs and Social Comment'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-215890-1}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;Chambers, Robert (2004), ''Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Part 1'', Kessinger, {{ISBN|978-0-7661-8338-4}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The name evolved into the imaginary General Ludd or King Ludd, who, like [[Robin Hood]], was reputed to live in [[Sherwood Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/politics/g3/ |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=19 August 2011 |title=The National Archives Learning Curve &amp;#124; Power, Politics and Protest &amp;#124; the Luddites}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] has called their machine wrecking "[[collective bargaining]] by riot", which had been a tactic used in Britain since the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as the scattering of manufactories throughout the country made large-scale strikes impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libcom.org/history/machine-breakers-eric-hobsbawm |author= Hobsbawm, Eric |title= 'The Machine Breakers', Past and Present 1 (1952), 57–70 |publisher= Libcom.org |date= 2009-07-04 |accessdate= 2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ-www.mit.edu"&gt;Author, Frank; Levy, David and Murnane, Richard J.

== Historical precedents ==

The lower classes of the 18th century, generally speaking, were not openly disloyal to the king or government.&lt;ref name="Wearmouth1945"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Featherstone Wearmouth|title=Methodism and the common people of the eighteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1w3AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 April 2013|year=1945|publisher=Epworth Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, violent action was rare because punishments were harsh. The majority of individuals were primarily concerned with meeting their own daily needs.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Wearmouth, ''Methodism and the Common People of the Eighteenth Century''. (1945), esp. chs. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement towards aggression in the 19th century can be seen as part of the rise in English working-class discontent due to the Industrial Revolution. Working conditions in the mills were harsh but efficient enough to threaten the livelihoods of skilled artisans. The new inventions allowed for faster and cheaper labour because machines were operated by less-skilled, low-wage labourers. The Luddites were not afraid of technology and did not attempt to eliminate technology out of fear. Their goal was instead to gain a better bargaining position with their employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merchant|first1=Brian|title=You've Got Luddites All Wrong|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/luddites-definition-wrong-labor-technophobe|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luddism was in fact a prototypical, insurrectionary labour movement involving a loose coalition of dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/luddites-definition-wrong-labor-technophobe|title=You've Got Luddites All Wrong|newspaper=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Kevin Binfield and others asserts that since organized action by [[stockinger (occupation)|stockingers]] had occurred at various times since 1675, the movements of the early 19th century must be viewed in the context of the hardships suffered by the working class during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], rather than as an absolute aversion to machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binfield|first=Kevin|title=Luddites and Luddism|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rude|first=George|title=The Crowd in History: A Study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730–1848|year=2001|publisher=Serif}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomis/&gt; Irregular rises in food prices provoked [[Keelmen|the Keelmen]] working in the [[port of Tyne]] to riot in 1710&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43320 |title=Historical events  – 1685–1782 &amp;#124; Historical Account of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (pp. 47–65) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tin miners to steal from granaries at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1727. There was a rebellion in [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1740, and the assault of Quaker corn dealers in 1756. Skilled artisans in the cloth, building, shipbuilding, printing and cutlery trades organized friendly societies to peacefully insure themselves against unemployment, sickness, and in some cases against intrusion of "foreign" labour into their trades, as was common among guilds.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"&gt;Charles Wilson, England's Apprenticeship, 1603-1763 (1965), pp. 344–45. PRO, SP 36/4/22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| The Falmouth magistrates reported to the Duke of Newcastle (16 Nov. 1727) that "the unruly tinners" had "broke open and plundered several cellars and granaries of corn." Their report concludes with a comment that suggests that they were no more able than some modern historians to understand the rationale of the direct action of the tinners: "the occasion of these outrages was pretended by the rioters to be a scarcity of corn in the county, but this suggestion is probably false, as most of those who carried off the corn gave it away or sold it at quarter price." PRO, SP 36/4/22.}}

Malcolm L. Thomis argued in his 1970 history, ''The Luddites'', that without the structure of a union, machine-breaking was one of very few mechanisms workers could use to increase pressure on employers, to undermine lower-paid competing workers and to create solidarity among workers, "These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made."&lt;ref name="thomis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomis|first=Malcolm|title=The Luddites: Machine Breaking in Regency England|year=1970|publisher=Shocken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agricultural variant of Luddism, centering on the breaking of threshing machines, occurred during the widespread [[Swing Riots]] of 1830 in southern and eastern England.&lt;ref name="harrison249"&gt;Harrison. The Common People. pp. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth of the movement ==
:''See also [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]], whose sewing machines were destroyed by tailors who believed that their jobs were threatened''

The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which saw a rise of difficult working conditions in the new textile factories. Luddites objected primarily to the rising popularity of automated textile equipment, threatening the jobs and livelihoods of skilled workers as this technology allowed them to be replaced by cheaper and less skilled workers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?all|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|last=Conniff|first=Richard|newspaper=Smithsonian|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement began in [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], [[Nottingham]] on 11 March 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beckett|first1=John|title=Luddites|url=http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/people/luddites.htm|website=The Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway|publisher=[[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire]]|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conniff&gt;{{cite web|last=Conniff|first=Richard|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/What-the-Luddites-Really-Fought-Against.html?c=y&amp;page=2|work=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loom#Handloom|Handloom]] weavers burned mills and pieces of factory machinery. Textile workers destroyed industrial equipment during the late 18th century,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; prompting acts such as the [[Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788]].

The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns to practice drills and maneuvers. Their main areas of operation began in [[Nottinghamshire]] in November 1811, followed by the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in early 1812 then [[Lancashire]] by March 1813.

In 1817, an unemployed Nottingham [[stockinger (occupation)|stockinger]] and probably ex-Luddite, named [[Jeremiah Brandreth]] led the [[Pentrich Rising]]. While this was a general uprising unrelated to machinery, it can be viewed as the last major Luddite act.

== Government response ==
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|Later interpretation of machine breaking (1812), showing two men superimposed on an 1844 engraving from the Penny magazine which shows a post 1820s [[Jacquard loom]].{{efn|[[:File:The Penny Magazine 1844, p.33.jpg|The Penny Magazine 1844, p.33]]}} Machine-breaking was criminalised by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] as early as 1721, the penalty being [[penal transportation]], but as a result of continued opposition to mechanisation the [[Frame Breaking Act|Frame Breaking Act 1812]] made the [[death penalty]] available: see "[[criminal damage in English law]]".]]

The [[British Army]] clashed with the Luddites on several occasions. At one time there were more British soldiers fighting the Luddites than there were fighting [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm, Eric]] (1964) "The Machine Breakers" in ''Labouring Men. Studies in the History of Labour.'', London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| Hobsbawm has popularized this comparison and refers to the original statement in [[Frank Ongley Darvall]] (1969) ''Popular Disturbances and Public Order in Regency England'', London, Oxford University Press, p. 260.}} Three Luddites, led by George Mellor, ambushed and assassinated mill owner William Horsfall of Ottiwells Mill in [[Marsden, West Yorkshire]] at [[Crosland Moor]] in [[Huddersfield]]. Horsfall had remarked that he would "Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=Horsfall++%22Ride+up+to+his+saddle+in+Luddite+blood.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q1ZRIoshVP&amp;sig=jiXoHzguYZ07yXCvzbLC6q1qf84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_ePGhO_QAhXBwiYKHZ1eCYQQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Horsfall%20%20%22Ride%20up%20to%20his%20saddle%20in%20Luddite%20blood.%22&amp;f=false|title=Grim Almanac of York|last=Sharp|first=Alan|date=2015-05-04|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780750964562|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall's groin, and all three men were arrested.

[[Lord Byron]] denounced what he considered to be the plight of the working class, the government’s inane policies and ruthless repression in the [[House of Lords]] on 27 February 1812: "I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of [[Turkey]]; but never, under the most despotic of infidel governments, did I behold such squalid wretchedness as I have seen since my return, in the very heart of a Christian country."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron, Debate on the 1812 Framework Bill, [[Hansard]], http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1812/feb/27/frame-work-bill#S1V0021P0_18120227_HOL_7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British government]] sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at [[York]] in January 1813, following the attack on Cartwrights mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton. The government charged over 60 men, including Mellor and his companions, with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities. While some of those charged were actual Luddites, many had no connection to the movement. Although the proceedings were legitimate jury trials, many were abandoned due to lack of evidence and 30 men were acquitted. These trials were certainly intended to act as [[show trials]] to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities. The harsh sentences of those found guilty, which included [[execution]] and [[penal transportation]], quickly ended the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/people/luddites.html#link4 |title=Luddites in Marsden: Trials at York |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326170835/http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/people/luddites.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Gaskell: The Life of Charlotte Bronte, Vol. 1, Ch. 6, for contemporaneous description of attack on Cartwright.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
{{anchor|In retrospect}}
In 1867 [[Karl Marx]] wrote that it would be some time before workers were able to distinguish between the machines and "the form of society which utilizes these instruments" and their ideas. "The instrument of labour, when it takes the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm#S5 Karl Marx, Capital Vol. I, Ch. 15, Sect. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, occupations that arose from the growth of trade and shipping in ports, also in 'domestic' manufacturers, were notorious for precarious employment prospects. Underemployment was chronic during this period,&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt; and it was common practice to retain a larger workforce than was typically necessary for insurance against labour shortages in boom times.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt;

Moreover, the organization of manufacture by merchant-capitalists in the textile industry was inherently unstable. While the financiers' capital was still largely invested in raw material, it was easy to increase commitment where trade was good and almost as easy to cut back when times were bad. Merchant-capitalists lacked the incentive of later factory owners, whose capital was invested in building and plants, to maintain a steady rate of production and return on fixed capital. The combination of seasonal variations in wage rates and violent short-term fluctuations springing from harvests and war, periodic outbreaks of violence are more easily understood.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==

In 1956, a speech said that "organized workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy."{{sfn|Sale|1995|p = 205}} More recently, the term [[Neo-Luddism]] has emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jones  | first = Steve E.  | title = Against technology: from the Luddites to neo-Luddism  | publisher = CRC Press   | year = 2006  | location =   | page = 20  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YwPP4pGRAwgC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-97868-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress (April 1996; Barnesville, Ohio), Neo-Luddism is "a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age."&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America's new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “[[Luddite fallacy]]” is used by economists in reference to the fear that [[technological unemployment]] inevitably generates [[structural unemployment]] and is consequently macroeconomically injurious. If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1 = Jerome | first1 = Harry | author1-link = | title = Mechanization in Industry, National Bureau of Economic Research | year = 1934 | url = http://papers.nber.org/books/jero34-1 | pages = 32–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MessagEase''' is an [[input method]] and [[virtual keyboard]] for touchscreen devices. It relies on a new entry system designed by Saied B. Nesbat, formatted as a 3x3 matrix keypad where users may press or swipe up, down, left, right, or diagonally to access all keys and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozorgui-Nesbat|first1=Saied|title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces - ICMI 2003|date=2003|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=1-58113-621-8|pages=4–11|chapter=A system for fast, full-text entry for small electronic devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a keyboard that was designed for devices like cell phones, mimicking the early cell phones' limited number of 12 keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khalil Ibrahim|first1=Ismail|title=Handbook of Research on Mobile Multimedia|date=30 September 2008|publisher=Information Science Reference|isbn=978-1605660462|page=777|edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common letters (the large letters in the illustration below) are accessed by a tap. Less common letters are accessed by a slide. Example: Tapping the center square generates an 'o'. Sliding to the left from the same square generates a 'c'. A green trail shows the path of the finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four funky Android keyboards|URL=http://www.cnet.com/news/four-funky-android-keyboards/|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard supports multiple user dictionaries, used for word prediction and correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android FAQ|URL=http://www.exideas.com/ME/android_faq.html|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software is developed and patented by ExIdeas, based in [[Belmont, California]]. It was first released in 2002 for the Palm, along with a paper in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomas|title=As Mobile Devices Morph Into Wearables, Keyboard Maker MessagEase Wants Your Fingers To Settle On Its Qwerty Killer|accessdate=19 March 2015|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
[[File:MessagEase.png|thumb|right|300px|Default keyboard]]
The [[keyboard layout]] has a 3x3 matrix that allows for full-text entry. The letter placement is optimized for minimal movement distance between letters, allowing for faster typing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozorgui-Nesbat|first1=Saied|title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces - ICMI 2003|date=2003|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=1-58113-621-8|pages=4–11|chapter=A system for fast, full-text entry for small electronic devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout is 67% faster than a standard QWERTY software keyboard, and 31% faster than a [[multi-tap]] keyboard, when typing is modeled with [[Fitt's law]].

===One touch keys===
The 9 most [[Letter frequency|frequent letters]] in English texts: ETAONRISH, are placed on the keyboard so they can be accessed on a single click.

===One move keys===
The next 17 less frequent letters: DLFCMUGYPWBVKJXQZ, are placed as to be triggered by a single move of the finger from or to the central key (O) (except for Z which is centered around the 'E' key together with some punctuation characters). For example, the letter V is typed by dragging the finger from A to O, and the letter D by moving from O to E.

===Special characters===
The moves producing special characters, which includes 38 characters including accents and punctuation marks, are displayed on a complete keyboard showing up when the user drags the space bar upwards.

This is not an alternate keyboard in the sense that the key pair moves are valid on both keyboard. It is rather a mnemonic help, which is normally hidden to avoid overwhelming the user with spurious information.

===Control keys===
A small vertical bar on the right gives direct access to the cut/copy/paste operations, the numeric keypad, the uppercase/lowercase control, as well the usual F1-F12 control keys. This is also commanded by moving the finger from one cell to an other.

===Semantic sugar===
A set of small movements makes the life of the typist easier, like drawing a small circle or a back and forth movement to write a letter uppercase, or prolonging the movement to put accent on letters.

The keyboard can be resized to fit the need of the user, and is also provided in a double sized version with the numeric keypad on the side of the alphabetic keypad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkhalifa|first1=Eshaa|title=Cognitively Informed Intelligent Interfaces: Systems Design and Development|date=31 May 2012|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1466616288|page=30|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software==
The keyboard is currently available for Android devices, iOS devices and the Apple Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.exideas.com/ME/index.php|title=MessageEase|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MessagEase was released in 2002 for the Palm. It was also originally a competitor to the [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] predictive input method, on a 12-button phone, with 9 number buttons. In this first iteration, each of the 9 primary characters needed to be pressed twice in a row, and secondary characters were entered by first pressing the main button, and then pressing one of the remaining 8 buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Paternò|editor1-first=Fabio|title=Mobile Human-Computer Interaction - 4th International Symposium - Mobile HCI 2002|date=2002|publisher=Springer|location=Pisa, Italy|isbn=3-540-44189-1|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this first iteration, because many letters required two presses, it was not significantly faster than the [[Multi-tap]] input method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chi Connect 2004: Conference Proceedings: Conference On Human Factors In Computing Systems|date=April 2004|publisher=ACM Press|location=Vienna, Austria|isbn=978-1581137026|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MessagEase is now exclusively for touch screens, and no longer has physical 12-button support. All characters are now entered by tapping or swiping.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the [[IBM System z]] machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer monitor|screen]] for input and output) are also [[personal computer]]s (in the generic sense).&lt;ref name="personalcomputer"&gt;An early use of the term ''personal computer'' in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs. ''(See "Personal Computer: Computers at Companies" reference below)''.  A ''microcomputer'' used as an embedded control system may have no human-readable input and output devices.  "Personal computer" may be used generically or may denote an [[IBM PC compatible]] machine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation ''micro'' was common during the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name="microvalid"&gt;Proof of "micro" as a once-common term:&lt;br /&gt;(i) Direct reference: Graham Kibble-White, [http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/oldott/www.offthetelly.co.uk/index7943.html?page_id=568 "Stand by for a Data-Blast"], Off the Telly.

Other books include Usborne's [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0860206378 "Understanding the Micro"] ({{ISBN|0-86020-637-8}}), a children's guide to microcomputers.&lt;/ref&gt; but has now fallen out of common usage.

== Origins ==
The term ''microcomputer'' came into popular use after the introduction of the [[minicomputer]], although [[Isaac Asimov]] used the term in his short story "[[The Dying Night]]" as early as 1956 (published in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' in July that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Dying Night|journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction|date=July 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the microcomputer replaced the many separate components that made up the minicomputer's CPU with one integrated microprocessor [[integrated circuit|chip]].

The French developers of the [[Micral]] N (1973) filed their patents with the term "Micro-ordinateur", a literal equivalent of "Microcomputer", to designate a solid state machine designed with a microprocessor.
In the USA, the earliest models such as the [[Altair 8800]] were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user, and came with as little as 256 [[byte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]], and no [[input/output]] devices other than indicator lights and switches, useful as a [[proof of concept]] to demonstrate what such a simple device could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: a concise history|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262517676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, as microprocessors and [[semiconductor memory]] became less expensive, microcomputers in turn grew cheaper and easier to use:
* Increasingly inexpensive logic chips such as the [[7400 series]] allowed cheap dedicated circuitry for improved [[user interface]]s such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] input, instead of simply a row of switches to toggle bits one at a time.
* Use of [[audio cassette]]s for inexpensive data storage replaced manual re-entry of a program every time the device was powered on.
* Large cheap arrays of silicon [[logic gates]] in the form of [[read-only memory]] and [[EPROM]]s allowed utility programs and self-[[booting]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]s to be stored within microcomputers. These [[stored program]]s could automatically load further more complex software from external storage devices without user intervention, to form an inexpensive [[turnkey system]] that does not require a computer expert to understand or to use the device.
* [[Random access memory]] became cheap enough to afford dedicating approximately 1-2 kilobytes of memory to a [[video display controller]] [[frame buffer]], for a 40x25 or 80x25 text display or blocky color graphics on a common household [[television]]. This replaced the slow, complex, and expensive [[teletypewriter]] that was previously common as an interface to minicomputers and mainframes.
All these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
A large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business  applications. By 1979, many companies such as [[Cromemco]], [[Processor Technology]], [[IMSAI]], [[North Star Computers]], [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products Corporation]], [[Ohio Scientific]], [[Altos Computer Systems]], [[Morrow Designs]] and others produced systems designed either for a resourceful end user or consulting firm to deliver business systems such as accounting, database management, and word processing to small businesses. This allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or [[time-sharing]] service the opportunity to automate business functions, without (usually) hiring a full-time staff to operate the computers. A representative system of this era would have used an [[S100 bus]], an 8-bit processor such as an [[Intel 8080]] or [[Zilog Z80]], and either [[CP/M]] or [[MP/M]] operating system.
The increasing availability and power of [[desktop computer]]s for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers.  In time, and as the industry matured, the market for [[personal computer]]s standardized around [[IBM PC compatible]]s running [[DOS]], and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
Modern desktop computers, [[video game console]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s, and many types of [[handheld device]]s, including [[mobile phone]]s, pocket [[calculator]]s, and industrial [[embedded system]]s, may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above.

== Colloquial use of the term ==

Everyday use of the expression "microcomputer" (and in particular the "micro" abbreviation) has declined significantly from the mid-1980s and has declined in commonplace usage since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/117935?redirectedFrom=microcomputer microcomputer]". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly associated with the first wave of all-in-one [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s and small business microcomputers (such as the [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[TRS 80]]). Although, or perhaps because, an increasingly diverse range of modern microprocessor-based devices fit the definition of "microcomputer", they are no longer referred to as such in everyday speech.

In common usage, "microcomputer" has been largely supplanted by the term "[[personal computer]]" or "PC", which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time, a term first coined in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/262572?redirectedFrom=personal+computer personal computer]". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; IBM first promoted the term "personal computer" to differentiate themselves from other microcomputers, often called "[[home computer]]s", and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, following its release, the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] itself was widely imitated, as well as the term.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The component parts were commonly available to producers and the [[BIOS]] was [[reverse engineered]] through [[cleanroom design]] techniques. [[IBM PC compatible]] "clones" became commonplace, and the terms "personal computer", and especially "PC", stuck with the general public, often specifically for a DOS or (nowadays) Windows-compatible computer.

Since the advent of [[microcontroller]]s (monolithic integrated circuits containing RAM, ROM and CPU all onboard), the term "micro" is more commonly used to refer to that meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Monitors, keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate. Computer memory in the form of [[RAM]], and at least one other less volatile, memory storage device are usually combined with the CPU on a [[system bus]] in one unit. Other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries, a [[power supply]] unit, a keyboard and various input/output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator ([[computer printer|printers]], [[computer display|monitors]], [[human interface device]]s).  Microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time, although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user.  Microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables, so that they are within easy access of users.  Bigger computers like [[minicomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer|mainframes]], and [[supercomputer]]s take up large [[cabinet (computer)|cabinet]]s or even dedicated rooms.

A microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually [[random-access memory|RAM]].  Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform  tasks using RAM alone, some form of [[secondary storage]] is normally desirable. In the early days of home micros, this was often a data [[cassette deck]] (in many cases as an external unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of [[floppy disk]] and [[hard disk]] drives) were built into the microcomputer case.

== History ==

[[Image:Early Personal Computers.jpg|thumb|320px|right|A collection of early microcomputers, including a [[Processor Technology]] SOL-20 (top shelf, right), an MITS [[Altair 8800]] (second shelf, left), a [[TV Typewriter]] (third shelf, center), and an [[Apple I]] in the case at far right.]]

===TTL precursors===
Although they did not contain any microprocessors, but were built around [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL), [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators as far back as 1968 had various levels of programmability comparable to microcomputers. The HP 9100B (1968) had rudimentary conditional (if) statements, statement line numbers, jump statements ([[go to]]), registers that could be used as variables, and primitive subroutines. The programming language resembled [[assembly language]] in many ways. Later models incrementally added more features, including the [[BASIC]] programming language (HP 9830A in 1971). Some models had tape storage and small printers. However, displays were limited to one line at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.org|title=The Museum of HP Calculators}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hewlett Packard 9100A|HP 9100A]] was referred to as a [[personal computer]] in an advertisement in a 1968 [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0021/other/0021ad.pdf |title=Powerful Computing Genie|publisher = Hewlett Packard |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that advertisement was quickly dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/162/3852.pdf |title=Restoring the Balance Between Analysis and Computation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HP was reluctant to sell them as "computers" because the perception at that time was that a computer had to be big in size to be powerful, and thus decided to market them as calculators.  Additionally, at that time, people were more likely to buy calculators than computers, and, purchasing agents also preferred the term "calculator" because purchasing a "computer" required additional layers of purchasing authority approvals.

The [[Datapoint 2200]], made by [[Datapoint|CTC]] in 1970, was also comparable to microcomputers.  While it contains no microprocessor, the [[instruction set]] of its custom TTL processor was the basis of the instruction set for the [[Intel 8008]], and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an 8008.  This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of developing the Datapoint's CPU, but ultimately CTC rejected the 8008 design because it needed 20 support chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |title=MicroprocessorHistory |publisher=Computermuseum.li |date=1971-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205820/http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early system, the [[Kenbak-1]], was released in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used discrete [[transistor–transistor logic]] instead of a microprocessor, but it functioned like a microcomputer in some ways. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, but it was not a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-computer.com/kenbak-1.shtml|title=Kenbak-1|website=The Vintage Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early microcomputers===
In late 1972, a French team headed by [[François Gernelle]] within a small company, Réalisations &amp; Etudes Electroniqes (R2E), developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor – the Intel 8008 8-bit microprocessor. This [[Micral|Micral-N]] was marketed in early 1973 as a "Micro-ordinateur" or ''microcomputer'', mainly for scientific and process-control applications. About a hundred [[Micral|Micral-N]] were installed in the next two years, followed by a new version based on the Intel 8080. Meanwhile, another French team developed the Alvan, a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors. The first version was based on LSI chips with an Intel 8008 as peripheral controller (keyboard, monitor and printer), before adopting the [[Zilog Z80]] as main processor.

In late 1972, a Sacramento State University team led by Bill Pentz built the Sac State 8008 computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/stories/bill-pentz-story/index.html |title=Digibarn Stories: Bill Pentz and (Earliest) History of the Microcomputer (August 2008) |publisher=Digibarn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to handle thousands of patients' medical records.  The Sac State 8008 was designed with the Intel 8008. It had a full set of hardware and software components: a disk operating system included in a series of programmable read-only memory chips (PROMs); 8 Kilobytes of RAM; IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL); a hard drive; a color display; a printer output; a 150 bit/s serial interface for connecting to a mainframe; and even the world's first microcomputer front panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terdiman |first=Daniel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10429544-52.html |title=Inside the world's long-lost first microcomputer &amp;#124; Geek Gestalt&amp;nbsp;— CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1973, [[Sord Computer Corporation]] (now [[Toshiba|Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation]]) completed the SMP80/08, which used the [[Intel 8008]] microprocessor. The SMP80/08, however, did not have a commercial release. After the first general-purpose microprocessor, the [[Intel 8080]], was announced in April 1974, Sord announced the SMP80/x, the first microcomputer to use the 8080, in May 1974.&lt;ref name="ipsj"&gt;http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0086.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches; one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them (the Datapoint 2200 was a striking exception, bearing a modern design based on a monitor, keyboard, and tape and disk drives).  Of the early "box of switches"-type microcomputers, the MITS [[Altair 8800]] (1975) was arguably the most famous.  Most of these simple, early microcomputers were sold as [[electronic kits]]—bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used.

The period from about 1971 to 1976 is sometimes called the [[:Category:Early microcomputers|first generation]] of microcomputers. Many companies such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered their microcomputers for use in terminal control, peripheral device interface control and industrial machine control. There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kawCnk4051wC&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Computer Adventures|last=Hawkins|first = William J.|date = December 1983|magazine = Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[Processor Technology]] [[SOL-20]] was designed, which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system. The [[SOL-20]] had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights. The [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known [[personal computer]] hardware and software companies, such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer]]. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.

===Home computers===
By 1977, the introduction of the second generation, known as [[home computer]]s, made microcomputers considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors' operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics. The ability to connect to a monitor (screen) or TV set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers. The [[BASIC]] language, which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language, became a standard feature. These features were already common in [[minicomputer]]s, with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar.

In 1979, the launch of the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] (initially for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]]) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its [[IBM PC]], the term [[personal computer]] became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the IBM PC architecture ([[PC compatible]]).

A '''mobile virtual network enabler''' ('''MVNE''') is a company that provides network infrastructure and related services, such as business support systems, administration and operations support systems to a [[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]] (MVNO).  This enables MVNOs to offer services to their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network enablement platforms and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/mvne-mobile-virtual-network-enabler|title=Gartner Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MVNEs specialise in planning, implementation and management of mobile services. Typically this includes SIM provisioning and configuration, customer billing, customer relationship management and value-added service platforms. In effect, they enable an MVNO to outsource both the initial integration with the MNO and the ongoing business and technical operations management. A related type of company is [[mobile virtual network aggregator]], or MVNA. MVNE is a telecom solution, whereas MVNA is a business model which includes wholesale of an operator's airtime and routing of traffic over the MVNE's own switches. 

The benefits of using an MVNE include a reduction in the upfront capital expenses of an MVNO, financing arrangements offered by MVNEs to cover start-up costs and reduced wholesale airtime costs achieved through economies of scale of hosting multiple MVNOs on a single MVNE platform. The other benefits could be reduced operational expenses by outsourcing management of business and technical operations, smoother launch processes and benefiting from previous experience of the MVNE as a negotiating channel for smaller MVNOs to reach a wholesale agreement with the MNO.

However, not all MVNEs are the same. There is significant variation in the level of experience, technical capability, integration and operational support. Furthermore, using an MVNE may not be appropriate for all MVNOs. The considerations for this decision are manifold, however, some of the key reasons for an MVNO against using an MVNE are:
* The MVNO is large enough to achieve volume efficiency when going direct to the host operator (usually several hundred thousand subscribers);
* The brand and distribution channels are sufficiently strong to negotiate a joint-venture or direct relationship and obtain better margins;
* The MVNO has access to existing telecoms infrastructure, for example switches, international capacity, fixed infrastructure and billing platforms.

Adoption of the MVNE model will have a significant impact on the margins of an MVNO business, acting either to improve or shrink these margins relative to direct or self-build models. As such, the decision to use an MVNE should not be taken lightly as the impacts could range from customer experience to business efficiency.

[[File:IBM PC 5150.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An [[IBM]] computer with a green monochrome monitor]]

A '''monochrome monitor''' is a type of [[cathode-ray tube|CRT]] [[computer monitor]] which was very common in the early days of computing, from the 1960s through the 1980s, before color monitors became popular. They are still widely used in applications such as computerized [[cash register]] systems, owing to the age of many registers. '''Green screen''' was the common name for a monochrome monitor using a [[green]] "P1" [[phosphor]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunkerofdoom.com/tubes/crt/crt_phosphor_research.pdf |title=Cathode Ray Tube Phosphors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant in the early-to-mid-1980s, they succeeded [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] and preceded color CRTs and later [[Liquid-crystal display|LCDs]] as the predominant visual output device for computers.

== Design ==

Unlike color monitors, which display text and graphics in multiple colors through the use of alternating-intensity red, green, and blue [[phosphor]]s, monochrome monitors have only one color of phosphor (''mono'' means "one", and ''chrome'' means "color"). All text and graphics are displayed in that color. Some monitors have the ability to vary the brightness of individual [[pixels]], thereby creating the illusion of depth and color, exactly like a black-and-white television.

Typically, only a limited set of brightness levels was provided to save [[display memory]] which was very expensive in the '70s and '80s. Either normal/bright or normal/dim (1 bit) per character as in the [[VT100]] or black/white per pixel in the [[Macintosh 128K]] or black, dark gray, light gray, white (2bit) per pixel like the [[NeXT MegaPixel Display]].

Monochrome monitors are commonly available in three colors: if the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P1 phosphor]] is used, the screen is green monochrome. If the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P3 phosphor]] is used, the screen is amber monochrome. If the [[Phosphor#Standard phosphor types|P4 phosphor]] is used, the screen is white monochrome (known as "paper white"); this is the same phosphor as used in early television sets.
An amber screen was claimed to give improved ergonomics, specifically by reducing eye strain; this claim appears to have little scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grandjean|first1=E|title=Ergonomics in Computerized Offices|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-85066-350-1|year=1986|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the color amber is a softer light, and would be less disruptive to a user's circadian rhythm. 

== Usage ==
Well-known examples of early monochrome monitors are the [[VT100]] from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], released in 1978, the Apple Monitor III in 1980, and the [[IBM 5151]], which accompanied the [[IBM PC]] [[IBM 5150|model 5150]] upon its 1981 release.

The 5151 was designed to work with the PC's [[Monochrome Display Adapter|Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA)]] text-only [[graphics card]], but the third-party [[Hercules Graphics Card]] became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution [[bitmap]]ped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from [[spreadsheet]]s like [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM [[Color Graphics Adapter]] 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] and [[Video Graphics Array]] standards in the late 1980s, for [[dual-monitor]] applications.

== Clarity ==
Pixel for pixel, the monochrome monitors produce sharper text and images than color [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. This is because a monochrome monitor is made up of a continuous coating of phosphor and the sharpness can be controlled by focusing the electron beam; whereas on a color monitor, each pixel is made up of three phosphor dots (one red, one blue, one green) separated by a mask. Monochrome monitors were used in almost all [[dumb terminal]]s and are still widely used in text-based applications such as computerized cash registers and [[point of sale]] systems because of their superior sharpness and enhanced readability.

Some green screen displays were furnished with a particularly full/intense phosphor coating, making the characters very clear and sharply defined (thus easy to read) but generating an afterglow-effect (sometimes called a "ghost image") when the text [[scroll]]ed down the screen or when a screenful of information was quickly replaced with another as in [[word processing]] page up/down operations. Other green screens avoided the heavy afterglow-effects, but at the cost of much more [[pixel]]ated character images. The 5151, amongst others, had brightness and contrast controls to allow the user to set their own compromise.

The ghosting effects of the now-obsolete green screens have become an eye-catching visual shorthand for computer-generated text, frequently in "futuristic" settings.  The opening titles of the first [[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]] film and the [[Matrix source code]] of the [[Matrix trilogy]] [[science fiction film]]s prominently feature computer displays with ghosting green text.  Green text is also featured in [[Dharma Initiative#Station 3: The Swan|the Swan]]'s computer in ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' series.

== Screen burn ==

Monochrome monitors are particularly susceptible to [[screen burn]] (hence the advent, and name, of the [[screensaver]]), because the phosphors used are very high intensity. Another effect of the high-intensity [[phosphors]] is an effect known as "ghosting", wherein a dim afterglow of the screen's contents is briefly visible after the screen has been blanked. This has a certain place in [[popular culture|pop culture]], as evidenced in movies such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

This ghosting effect is deliberate on some monitors, known as "long persistence" monitors. These use the relatively long decay period of the phosphor glow to reduce flickering and eye strain.

NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz.

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
'''Nyctography''' is a form of [[substitution cipher]] writing created by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1891.

Nyctography is written with a nyctograph (also invented by Carroll) and uses a system of dots and strokes all based on a dot placed in the upper left corner. Using the Nyctograph, one could quickly jot down ideas or notes without the aid of light.

Carroll invented the Nyctograph and Nyctography because he was often awakened during the night with thoughts that needed to be written down immediately, and didn't want to go through the lengthy process of lighting a lamp just to have to extinguish it shortly thereafter.

==Nyctograph==
The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen square holes, each a quarter inch wide, and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Carroll's design, which could then be transcribed the following day. 

He first named it "typhlograph", but at the suggestion of one of his brother-students,{{clarify|reason=What does this term mean? Is this a fellow student? I'm not sure if Caroll was a student in 1891. Note: the wording is present in the original source as-is, so not an error.|date=November 2018}} this was subsequently changed into "Nyctograph".&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11483/11483-h/11483-h.htm “The Life And Letters Of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)” by  Stuart Dodgson Collingwood  B.A. Christ Church, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Carroll used an oblong of card with an oblong cut out of the centre to guide his writing in the dark.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; This did not appear to be satisfactory as the results were illegible. The new and final version of the nyctograph is recorded in his journal of September 24, 1891, and is the subject of a letter to ''The Lady'' magazine of October 29, 1891: 
{{quote|Any one who has tried, as I have often done, the process of getting out of bed at 2 a.m. in a winter night, lighting a candle, and recording some happy thought which would probably be otherwise forgotten, will agree with me it entails much discomfort. All I have now to do, if I wake and think of something I wish to record, is to draw from under the pillow a small memorandum book containing my Nyctograph, write a few lines, or even a few pages, without even putting the hands outside the bed-clothes, replace the book, and go to sleep again. … I tried rows of square holes, each to hold one letter (quarter of an inch square I found a very convenient size), and this proved a much better plan than the former; but the letters were still apt to be illegible. Then I said to myself ‘Why not invent a square alphabet, using only dots at the corners, and lines along the sides?’ I soon found that, to make the writing easy to read, it was necessary to know where each square began. This I secured by the rule that every square-letter should contain a large black dot in the N.W. corner. … [I] succeeded in getting 23 of [the square-letters] to have a distinct resemblance to the letters they were to represent. Think of the number of lonely hours a blind man often spends doing nothing, when he would gladly record his thoughts, and you will realise what a blessing you can confer on him by giving him a small ‘indelible’ memorandum-book, with a piece of paste-board containing rows of square holes, and teaching him the square-alphabet.}}

From the description it appears that Carroll’s nyctograph was a single row of 16 boxes cut from a piece of card. Carroll would enter one of his symbols in each box, then move the card down to the next line (which, in the darkness, probably, he would have to estimate) and then repeat the process.

==Nyctographic alphabet==
[[File:Nyctographic alphabet.png|thumb|Lewis Carroll's nyctographic alphabet]]
Each character had a large dot or circle in the upper-left corner. Beside the 26 letters of the alphabet, there were five additional characters for 'and', 'the', the corners of the letter 'f' to indicate that the following characters were digits ('figures'), the corners of the letter 'l' to indicate that they were letters, and the corners of the letter 'd' to indicate that the following six characters were a date in DDMMYY format. There was no capitalization, punctuation or digits ''per se'', though modern font designers have created them (e.g. capitals may be double-scored, punctuation marks may have the large dot at the bottom right corner, digits at the bottom left). 

==Numbers==
As in braille, letters were assigned to represent digits. The values were taken from his [[Memoria Technica]], which assigned two consonants to each digit, with vowels unassigned, so that any number could be read off as a word. For nyctography, one of the consonants was used for each digit. Most are the initials of the numerals, as follows. (In brackets are the other values of the Memoria Technica, which apart from leftover ''j'' for 3 have their own motivations.)

* 1 – b (first consonant) [also c]
* 2 – d (for ''duo'' and ''deux'') [also w of 'two']
* 3 – t (for 'three') [also j]
* 4 – f (for 'four') [also q of ''quatre'']
* 5 – l (roman numeral 50) [also v of 'five']
* 6 – s (for 'six') [also x of 'six']
* 7 – m (final of ''septem'') [also p of ''septem'']
* 8 – h (for ''huit'') [also k]
* 9 – n (for 'nine') [also g]
* 0 – z (for 'zero') [also r of 'zero']

The following article details governmental and other organizations from around the world who are in the process of evaluating the suitability of using ([[Adoption (software implementation)|adopting]]) [[OpenDocument]], an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging office documents that may be edited.

== Overview ==
[[File:OpenDocument adoption world map.svg|thumb|400px|right|World map of countries, using the OpenDocument standard {{legend|#28ae28|Officially approved}}{{legend|#4223ad|Mandatory standard (NATO)}}]]

The OpenDocument format ([[ODF]]) was accepted as a standard by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in May 2005, and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in November 2006, as standard ISO/IEC 26300:2006.

Microsoft submitted another format, Office Open XML (aka [[OOXML]]), to [[Ecma International]] where it was accepted as a standard in December 2006. The Office Open XML specification was published as standard ISO/IEC 29500:2008 in November 2008.

OpenDocument has been officially approved by national standards bodies of Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odfalliance.org/press/Newsletter20090921.pdf ODF Alliance Newsletter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612231044/http://www.odfalliance.org/press/Newsletter20090921.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[NATO]]''' with its 28 members (Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the USA) uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nhqc3s.hq.nato.int/Apps/Architecture/NISP/volume3/apds05.html|title=D.5. User Facing Capabilities|author=Interoperability Capability Team (IP CaT)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== South Africa ===
On October 23, 2007, the Department of Public Service and Administration of the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] released [http://www.oss.gov.za/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Downloads&amp;file=index&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=13 a report on interoperability standards]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in government information systems.  It specifies ODF as the standard for "working office document formats" (with UTF-8/ASCII text and comma-separated values data as the only alternatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url=http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?src=rss&amp;id=1838

 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2008 ODF is a national standard too, not only the standard to be used by government departments. South African code for the ODF standard is "SANS 26300:2008/ISO/IEC 26300:2006".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sabs.co.za/Business_Units/Standards_SA/WebStore/search/detail.aspx?id=18646&amp;lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2008 all departments will be able to read and write in the Open Document Format. In 2009, ODF will become the default document format for South African government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tectonic.co.za/?p=2365|title=South Africa adopts ODF as a national standard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

every year recommending file formats for various tasks.  In their latest version they recommend the use of Microsoft Office '97 or OpenOffice.org v2.0 (based on OpenDocument 1.0) file formats for collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and slideshow presentations.

=== India ===
Chandershekhar, [[India]]'s secretary of [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Information and Technology]],  said, "We are glad to note that with formation of a National ODF alliance, India too would be playing a pivotal role in spearheading the ODF revolution. Further, considering the huge potential of eGovernance in the nation as well as the need to adopt open standards to make our data systems more inter-operable and independent of any limiting proprietary tools, we feel that ODF is a great technological leap and a big boon to further propel IT right to India's grass root levels. I congratulate this initiative of leading private &amp; public organisations and wish them all the best in this endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle1.asp?artid=85632] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627053226/http://www.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle1.asp?artid=85632 |date=June 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allahabad High Court of India has decided, as policy, to use OpenDocument format for its documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yksingh.blogspot.com/2006/06/open-document-format.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112085507/http://yksingh.blogspot.com/2006/06/open-document-format.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agencies are required to:
* Use ODF
* Transition to open-source operating systems

====Kerala====

In 2007 Kerala released an Information Technology Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} &lt;/ref&gt;
designed to turn Kerala into a knowledge society.

They decided that open standards such as ODF would be followed in e-governance projects to avoid proprietary lock in.

=== Japan ===
On June 29, 2007, the government of [[Japan]] published a new interoperability framework which gives preference to the procurement of products that follow open standards including the ODF standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} &lt;/ref&gt; On July 2 the government declared that they wouldn't stop from adopting alternative document formats, because they hold the view that formats like [[Office Open XML]] which other organizations such as [[Ecma International]] and ISO had also approved was, according to them, an open standard, too. Also, they said that it was one of the preferences, whether the format is open, to choose which software the government shall deploy.

Government ministries and agencies are required to:
* Solicit bids from software vendors whose products support internationally recognized open standards

Open formats:
* Are to be preferred, and
* Must be used to promote exchange of information between ministries

Japan's Diet passed an open standards software incentive as part of its omnibus Special Taxation Measures law:
* Provides tax reductions for companies which buy open-standard based software
* Went into effect April 2008 and expires in March 2011.

=== Malaysia ===
In August 2007, The Malaysian government announced plans to adopt open standards and the Open Document Format (ODF) within the country's public sector. The Malaysian Administration Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) issued a tender for a nine-month study to evaluate the usage of open standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2007-09-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2008 on the use of ODF is mandatory within the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2008/03/mampu-migrates.html Open Malaysia: MAMPU migrates to OpenOffice.org and ODF to increase freedom of choice and interoperability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323235203/http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2008/03/mampu-migrates.html |date=2008-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
South Korean government adopted OpenDocument as a part of [[Korean Industrial Standards]] KS X ISO/IEC 26300 in 2007, but public documents are still made and distributed in [[Hangul (word processor)|.hwp]] format. There is no regulation of legislation about OpenDocument since 2007.

===Taiwan===
Already in 2009 ODF was chosen as official standard. But only from 2014 large scale migrations to ODF (and because of freedom of choice that brought) to LibreOffice started.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
Adoption of OpenOffice.org does not implicate adoption of ODF - they could still set other formats as default file format -&gt; need better references!
=== Vietnam ===
In September 2007, more than 20,000 computers used at Party agencies nationwide will replace Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

--&gt;

==Europe==

The [[European Commission]] has, since at least 2003, been investigating various options for storing documents in an XML-based format, commissioning technical studies such as the "Valoris Report".&lt;ref&gt;Valoris (2004). [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982 Comparative Assessment of Open Documents Formats Market Overview] aka the "Valoris Report". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927193137/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982 |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, the Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC) asked an OpenOffice team and a Microsoft team to present on the relative merits of their XML-based office document formats.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Tim. (September 24–26, 2004) [http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC SmartEC] (Accessed on October 17, 2005. (Discussing Open Office XML ISO Certification).)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, TAC issued a set of recommendations, in particular noting that, "Because of its specific role in society, the public sector must avoid &lt;nowiki&gt;[a situation where]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a specific product is forced on anyone interacting with it electronically. Conversely, any document format that does not discriminate against market actors and that can be implemented across platforms should be encouraged. Likewise, the public sector should avoid any format that does not safeguard equal opportunities to market actors to implement format-processing applications, especially where this might impose product selection on the side of citizens or businesses. In this respect standardisation initiatives will ensure not only a fair and competitive market but will also help safeguard the interoperability of implementing solutions whilst preserving competition and innovation." It then issued recommendations, including:
* Industry actors not currently involved with the OASIS Open Document Format consider participating in the standardisation process in order to encourage a wider industry consensus around the format;
* Microsoft considers issuing a public commitment to publish and provide non-discriminatory access to future versions of its WordML specifications;
* Microsoft should consider the merits of submitting XML formats to an international standards body of their choice;
* Industry is encouraged to provide filters that allow documents based on the WordML specifications and the emerging OASIS Open Document Format to be read and written to other applications whilst maintaining a maximum degree of faithfulness to content, structure and presentation. These filters should be made available for all products;
* The public sector is encouraged to provide its information through several formats. Where by choice or circumstance only a single revisable document format can be used this should be for a format around which there is industry consensus, as demonstrated by the format's adoption as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC). (May 25, 2004) [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2592/5588 TAC Approval on Conclusions and Recommendations on Open Document Formats]. (Accessed on October 17, 2005.) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161429/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2592/5588 |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official recommendation for a certain format was not issued however.

===Belgium===
A memorandum on the use of open standards for creating and exchanging office documents was approved by [[Belgian federal government|Belgium's federal Council of Ministers]] on June 23, 2006. OpenDocument was proposed as the standard for exchanging office documents such as texts, spreadsheets, presentations within the federal civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Belgium's federal Council of Ministers. (2006) [http://presscenter.org/fr/node/47487?lang=en Open standards: Belgium's federal Council of Ministers approves ODF (Open Document Format)]. (Accessed on December 6, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2007, every federal government department has to be able to accept and read OpenDocument documents.&lt;ref&gt;Techworld. (2006) [http://www.techworld.com/applications/news/index.cfm?newsID=6335&amp;pagtype=all Belgium adopts OpenDocument]. (Accessed on December 6, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Government agencies are required to:
* Make each government form posted on a public Web site “accessible in a way that makes it legible in accessible freeware applications”
* Options for meeting this requirement:
** ODF
** PDF
** HTML

Until then Government agencies are required to:
* Accept ODF and OOXML “data-processing documents” created by the public, businesses, and other governmental units

Government entities are permitted to:
* Refrain from implementing the new OOXML and ODF standard if doing so would incur “additional costs or inconveniences” or raise “IT security concerns”

=== Finland ===

Finland's Ministry of Justice has chosen OpenOffice.org and thus the OpenDocument format as their main document format from the beginning of 2007. The decision was made after deep research of ODF possibilities. Other ministries may follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.om.fi/ Oikeusministeriö - Justitieministeriet - Etusivu]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to French government's RGI (general interoperability framework), ODF is the "recommended format for office documents within French administrations".  OOXML is tolerated for "information exchange needs through tables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.april.org/en/french-government-it-directorate-stands-its-ground-odf-supported-ooxml-rejected|title=French Government IT directorate stands its ground : ODF supported, OOXML rejected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agencies are required to:
* Accept documents submitted in [[XML]] formats: ODF format as like OOxml format (both are in "Observations")
* Use [[PDF/A]] to preserve text documents

Government agencies are encouraged to:
* Install OpenOffice.org (an open-source, ODF-based productivity suite)
* Use ODF to create text documents, spreadsheets, and slideshow-style presentations

Government agencies are prohibited from:
* Migrating to any productivity suite formats other than ODF {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Germany ===

A large number of [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]], state and goverenmental offices and cities widely use products that support ODF (e.g. StarOffice, OpenOffice.org).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==== Federal ====

In December 2008 the governmental IT-Board of the [[Bundesregierung]] decided to make use of the ODF-Format in the Federal administration in order to improve IT-security and interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesministerium des Innern: [http://www.bmi.bund.de/cln_012/nn_122688/sid_E255A89BFD4FB3652A8B62532784B714/Internet/Content/Nachrichten/Pressemitteilungen/2008/12/ODF.html IT-Rat der Bundesregierung eröffnet den Einsatz offener Dokumentenformate (ODF)]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106231645/http://www.bmi.bund.de/cln_012/nn_122688/sid_E255A89BFD4FB3652A8B62532784B714/Internet/Content/Nachrichten/Pressemitteilungen/2008/12/ODF.html |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Foreign Office has migrated totally to the use of ODF formats also in the 250 foreign offices abroad (it has reduced its IT costs to a third in comparison to other Ministries &lt;ref name="heise2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/85977|title=Auswärtiges Amt spart im IT-Bereich kräftig dank Open Source|author=Stefan Krempl|date=28 February 2007|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Under Germany's Standards and Architectures for eGovernment Applications 4.0 (SAGA 4.0), ODF recommended for editable text documents, a multi-stakeholder initiative that recommends and mandates standards to be used by the German federal government.

==== Bundesländer ====

The City of [[Freiburg]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] uses OpenOffice.org and OpenDocument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1167453/index.html Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau: Offene Standards in der öffentlichen Verwaltung] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701225031/http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1167453/index.html |date=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Adoption of OpenOffice.org does not implicate adoption of ODF - they could still set other formats as default file format -&gt; need better references!

The City of [[Munich]] in [[Bavaria]] has already migrated 14000 desktops to OpenOffice.org and OpenDocument while [[LiMux|migrating as a whole to Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muenchen.de/limux|title=Landeshauptstadt München -  Das Projekt LiMux|author=Landeshauptstadt München, Redaktion|work=Landeshauptstadt München}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The Italian standardization organization [http://www.uni.com/ UNI] adopted ISO/IEC 26300 (ODF 1.0) on January 26, 2007 (UNI CEI ISO/IEC 26300:2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni.com/uni/controller/it/comunicare/articoli/2007_1/odf_26300.htm |title=UNI - Ente Italiano di Normazione |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010125511/http://www.uni.com/uni/controller/it/comunicare/articoli/2007_1/odf_26300.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian region of [[Umbria]] announced its migration to LibreOffice and OpenDocument format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libreumbria.wordpress.com/|title=LibreUmbria: una storia di qualità in PA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Italian Ministry of Defence announced that it would standardise on ODF and install LibreOffice on 150,000 PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hillenius|first1=Gijs|title=Italian military to switch to LibreOffice and ODF|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/italian-military-switch-libreoffice-and-odf|accessdate=15 September 2015|work=Joinup|publisher=European Open Source Observatory|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===

From the beginning of 2009 onwards, [[Open source|open source software]] and the ODF format will be the standard for reading, publishing and the exchange of information for all governmental organisations. Whenever the software used is not open source special reasons have to be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lijsten.forumstandaardisatie.nl/open-standaard/odf12|title=ODF 1.2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gotze.eu/2007/09/netherlands-picks-odf.html GotzeBlogged » Blog Archive » Netherlands Picks ODF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040813/http://gotze.eu/2007/09/netherlands-picks-odf.html |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minez.nl/content.jsp?objectid=153176&amp;rid=home|title=Ministerie van Economische Zaken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
[[Norwegian Ministry of Government Administration and Reform|Norway's Ministry of Government Administration and Reform]] decided in December 2007 that ODF (ISO/IEC 26300) '''MUST''' be used from 2009 when publishing documents that are meant to be changed after downloading, i.e. forms that are to be filled in by the user. So all website forums will use this format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad/pressesenter/pressemeldinger/2007/Opne-dokumentstandardar-blir-obligatoris.html?id=494810|title=Open document standards to be obligatory for state information|author=Ministry of Government Administration and Reform|work=Government.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 it is mandatory for all government agencies to use document formats (PDF or) ODF when exchanging documents as attachments to e-mail between government and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idg.no/computerworld/article137544.ece|title=Nye it-standarder i staten|author=Morten Isebakke Lyse|work=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad/press-centre/press-releases/2009/new-obligatory-it-standards-for-the-stat.html?id=570650regjeringen.no|title=Siden er ikke tilgjengelig|publisher=|access-date=2009-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009175806/http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad/press-centre/press-releases/2009/new-obligatory-it-standards-for-the-stat.html?id=570650regjeringen.no|archive-date=2012-10-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===

In 2008, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Parliament discussed a bill proposed by the [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]]) determining that the adoption of open standard formats – namely ODF – shall be mandatory within all public administration agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/DetalheIniciativa.aspx?BID=34060|title=Iniciativa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2011, the government published a law on Open Standards.&lt;ref&gt;Associação de Empresas de Software Open Source Portuguesas: [http://www.esop.pt/uploads/2011/10/OpenStandardsPT.pdf ''Portuguese Parliament, Law n. 36/2011, On the adoption of Open Standards in the Information Systems of the State''] June 21, 2011 (PDF; 40 kB) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207031608/http://www.esop.pt/uploads/2011/10/OpenStandardsPT.pdf |date=December 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 8 November 2012, the list of mandatory standards was published: ODF version 1.1 becomes obligatory in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2012/11/21600/0646006465.pdf |page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the Câmara Municipal de Vieira do Minho (county of Vieira do Minho) in Portugal announced its migration to LibreOffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-vminho.pt/index.php?oid=9871&amp;op=all|title=Câmara Municipal de Vieira do Minho adopta Software Livre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Despite the heated discussions about adopting Free Software and Open Standards in [[Romania]]n public administration - especially at [http://www.eliberatica.ro/2009/index eLiberatica 2009] - the Romanian [http://www.mcsi.ro/ Ministry for Communications and Information Society] passed no '''official''' bill to enforce the use of Open Standards, particularly [[OpenDocument]]. In June 2009, the ministry Gabriel Sandu declared, in an interview to [http://www.zf.ro/ Ziarul Financiar], that „we cannot give up Microsoft licenses overnight”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zf.ro/business-hi-tech/ministrul-comunicatiilor-gabriel-sandu-spune-ca-statul-nu-poate-renunta-peste-noapte-la-microsoft-4550649/|title=Ministrul Comunicatiilor, Gabriel Sandu spune ca statul nu poate renunta peste noapte la Microsoft|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the harsh critics from the large national Free Software community and a few '''important''' local IT businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zf.ro/zf-english/omnilogic-government-should-work-with-open-source-applications-not-pay-millions-of-euros-for-licences-4478884/|title=Omnilogic: Government should work with open source applications, not pay millions of euros for licences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[OpenDocument]] format and [[OpenDocument software|OpenDocument-capable software]] are widely used, not only by enthusiasts, but by businesses as well, including large parts of the Romanian government agencies, mayoralties, courts, notaries, insurance firms, accountants, engineers, etc. A (grossly incomplete) list of implementations, including Romania, is maintained here [http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Major_OpenOffice.org_Deployments#Europe]

===Russia===
The Russian standardization organization [[Federal Agency on Technical Regulating and Metrology]] adopted ISO/IEC 26300 as national standard GOST R ISO/IEC 26300-2010 (ГОСТ Р ИСО/МЭК 26300-2010) on December 21, 2010.

===Serbia===
Government administration is required to:
* Use the ISO 19005 - Electronic document file format for long-term preservation (PDF/A format) for official electronic documents.
* For drafts, proposals and templates one of the following format should be used:
** ISO 26300 - Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0
** ISO 29500 - Office Open XML File Formats

If any other specialized file format is used for technical reasons, all parties in the document exchange must agree that  there is a technical interoperability for using that file format.

Government agencies are required to:
* Use the following formats when exchanging documents with citizens or other agencies:
** PDF/A (“urgently recommended”)
** PDF/X (“recommended”)
** ODF (“recommended”)
** OOXML (“recommended”)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK government will specify requirements by reference to open standards and require compliance with open standards in solutions where feasible. The government indicated it will support the use of ODF 1.0 (ISO/IEC 26300:2006).

[[BECTA]] (British Education Communication Technology Agency) is the UK agency in charge of defining information technology (IT) policy for all schools in the United Kingdom, including standards for all the schools' infrastructure. In 2005 they published a comprehensive document describing the policy for infrastructure in schools.

This document highly recommends the use of OpenDocument and a few other formats for office document data. BECTA explains this as follows: "Any office application used by institutions must be able to be saved to (and so viewed by others) using a commonly agreed format that ensures an institution is not locked into using specific software. The main aim is for all office based applications to provide functionality to meet the specifications described here (whether licensed software, open source or unlicensed freeware) and thus many application providers could supply the educational institution ICT market.".

In September 2007 the Argentinian Province of [[Misiones]] decided via decrete that the use of ODF shall be mandatory within the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misiones.gov.ar/egov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=2 Gobierno Electrónico de la Provincia de Misiones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043307/http://www.misiones.gov.ar/egov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=2 |date=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a million people live in this province, which is one of the 23 provinces of Argentina.

=== Brazil ===
With the publication of "e-Ping Interoperability Framework",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-e-projetos/e-ping-padroes-de-interoperabilidade/versoes-do-documento-da-e-ping e-Ping Interoperability Framework] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421175906/https://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-e-projetos/e-ping-padroes-de-interoperabilidade/versoes-do-documento-da-e-ping |date=April 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil became the first South American country to officially recommend the adoption of OpenDocuments within the government.

As stated in version v3.0 of 2007: "Preferred adoption of Open Formats: e-PING defines that, whenever possible, open standards will be used in technical specifications. "Proprietary standards" will be accepted, in this transition period, with the perspective of replacement as soon as there are conditions for a complete migration. With no loss to these goals, are to be respected those situations when there is the need to consider security requisites and information integrity. When available, Free Software solutions are to be considered preferential, accordingly with the policy defined by the Comitê Executivo de Governo Eletrônico (CEGE)"

Since April 2008 ODF is a national standard in Brazil, coded as NBRISO/IEC26300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abntnet.com.br/fidetail.aspx?FonteID=40911 NBR ISO/IEC 26300] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615121400/https://www.abntnet.com.br/fidetail.aspx?FonteID=40911 |date=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010 version, the transition period has officially ended, and proprietary document formats may no longer be used in the federal public administration, although in practice this is not the case in many federal agencies and departments.

Additionally, a number of parties, including local governments, companies and non-governmental organizations have signed into the Brasília Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarelivre.gov.br/protocolo-brasilia-1|title=Protocolo Brasília|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which formalize intentions and set goals for adopting the use of the Open Document standard.

====Massachusetts====
{{update|type=section|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- The MS Office stuff in particular --&gt;
The [[United States]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Massachusetts]] has been examining its options for implementing [[XML]]-based document processing. In early 2005, [[Eric Kriss]], Secretary of Administration and Finance in [[Massachusetts]], was the first [[government]] official in the [[United States]] to publicly connect open formats to a public policy purpose: "It is an overriding imperative of the American [[democratic system]] that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eoaf/open_formats_comments.html|title=Executive Office of Administration &amp; Finance - Mass.Gov|author=anf|work=Administration and Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a September 16, 2005 meeting with the [http://www.masoftware.org/ Mass Technology Leadership Council] Kriss stated that he believes this is fundamentally an issue of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danbricklin.com/log/2005_09_07.htm#meetingphotos|title=Starting September 7, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While supporting the principle of private intellectual property rights, he said sovereignty trumped any private company's attempt to control the state's public records through claims of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaregarden.com/cgi-bin/oss-sig/wiki.pl?OpenFormatMeetingSept2005|title=MTLC Open Source SIG Wiki: OpenFormatMeetingSept2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in September 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to formally endorse [[OpenDocument]] formats for its public records and, at the same time, reject [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] new [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] format, now standardized as ISO/IEC 29500:2008 — [[Office Open XML]].  This decision was made after a two-year examination of file formats, including many discussions with Microsoft, other vendors, and various experts, plus some limited trial programs in individual communities like [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] and [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]]. [[Microsoft Office]], which has a nearly 100% market share among the state's employees, did not support OpenDocument formats until Service Pack 2 of Office 2007. Microsoft had indicated that OpenDocument formats will not be supported in new versions of Office, even though they support many other formats (including [[ASCII]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[WordPerfect]]), and analysts believe it would be easy for Microsoft to implement the standard.  If Microsoft chooses not to implement OpenDocument, Microsoft will disqualify themselves from future consideration.  Several analysts (such as Ovum) believe that Microsoft will eventually support OpenDocument.  On 6 July 2006 Microsoft announced that they would support the OpenDocument format and create a plugin to allow Office to save to ODF.

After this announcement by Massachusetts supporting OpenDocument, a large number of people and organizations spoke up about the policy, both pro and con (see the references section).  [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Corel]], [[IBM]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] all sent letters to Massachusetts supporting the measure.  In contrast, Microsoft sent in a letter highly critical of the measure.  A group named "[[Citizens Against Government Waste]]" (CAGW) also opposed the decision. The group claimed that Massachusetts' policy established "an arbitrary preference for open source," though both open source software and proprietary software can implement the specification, and both kinds of developers were involved in creating the standard (CAGW, 2005). However, [[InternetNews]] and [[Linux Weekly News]] noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an [[astroturfing]] campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). [[James Prendergast (executive)|James Prendergast]], executive director of a coalition named "[[Americans for Technology Leadership]]" (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a [[Fox News]] article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170724,00.html|title=Massachusetts Should Close Down OpenDocument|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Prendergast failed to disclose that Microsoft is a founding member of ATL. Fox News later published a follow-up article disclosing that fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,172063,00.html FOX News, 2005]; Jones, September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State Senator]] [[Marc R. Pacheco]] and [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|State Secretary]] [[William F. Galvin]] have expressed reservations about  this plan. Pacheco held a hearing on October 31, 2005, on the topic of OpenDocument.  Pacheco did not want OpenDocument to be declared as the executive branch standard, primarily on procedural grounds.  Pacheco believed that the [[executive branch]] had to receive permission to set an executive standard from the multi-branch IT Advisory Board. In contrast, The Massachusetts Information Technology Division (ITD), and its general council, believe the Advisory board's role is to advise ITD, and ITD did discuss the issue with the IT Advisory Board, but ITD's Peter Quinn and Linda Hamel (ITD's General Counsel) asserted that there is no requirement that "ITD approach the Advisory Board for permission to adopt policies that will impact only the Executive Department." Hamel later filed a legal briefing justifying ITD's position (Hamel, 2005). Massachusetts' [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Court]] has ruled that the various branches of government are prohibited from mandating IT standards on each other; this ruling appears to support ITD's claim.  Pacheco also did not like the process used to select OpenDocument. However, Pacheco appears to have had many fundamental
misunderstandings of the issues. Andy Updegrove said that at the time, "Senator Pacheco doesn't understand the difference between open source and open standards (and certainly doesn't understand the difference between OpenDocument and OpenOffice). More than once, he indicated that he thought that the policy would require the Executive Agencies to use OpenOffice.org, not realizing that there are other compliant alternatives. He also thought that this would act to the detriment of Massachusetts software vendors, who (he thinks) would be excluded from doing business with the Commonwealth." Pacheco also thought that OpenOffice.org was under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], but in fact it is released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] (Jones, October 31, 2005) (Jones, November 14, 2005).  He attempted to halt implementation of OpenDocument in the executive branch via an amendment (to S. 2256), but the amended bill was never sent to the [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]].

Since then in 2007 Massachusetts has [https://web.archive.org/web/20100621051826/http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=afterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Research+%26+Technology&amp;L2=Information+Technology+Services+%26+Support&amp;L3=Application+Services&amp;L4=Open+Initiatives&amp;sid=Eoaf&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=itd_services_application_open_initiatives_odf_open_xml&amp;csid=Eoaf amended] its approved technical standards list to include [[Office Open XML]].

====Other states and organizations in the US====
In November 2005, James Gallt, associate director for the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, said that a number of other state agencies are also exploring the use of OpenDocument (LaMonica, November 10, 2005).

In April 2006, a bill was introduced in the Minnesota state legislature to require all state agencies to use open data formats. It is expected that the OpenDocument Format will be advanced as a way of meeting the proposed requirement. (Gardner, April 7, 2006).

}}'''Over-the-Air programming''' (OTA) refers to various methods of distributing new [[software]], configuration settings, and even [[Over the Air Rekeying|updating encryption keys]] to devices like [[cellphone]]s, [[set-top box]]es or [[Secure voice|secure voice communication]] equipment (encrypted 2-way radios). One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users, who are unable to refuse, defeat, or alter that update, and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel. A user could "refuse" OTA but the "channel manager" could also "kick them off" the channel automatically.

In the context of the [[mobile content]] world these include '''over-the-air service provisioning''' (OTASP), '''over-the-air provisioning''' (OTAP) or '''over-the-air parameter administration''' (OTAPA),  or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as [[Wireless access point|WAP]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].

As mobile phones accumulate new applications and become more advanced, OTA configuration has become increasingly important as new updates and services come on stream. OTA via [[Short Message Service|SMS]] optimizes the configuration data updates in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] cards and handsets and enables the distribution of new software updates to mobile phones or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as WAP or MMS. OTA messaging provides remote control of mobile phones for service and subscription activation, personalization and programming of a new service for mobile operators and telco third parties.&lt;ref name="MME2001req"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010811201929/http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|archivedate=11 August 2001|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|accessdate=19 April 2011|title=Mobile Phones&amp;nbsp;— Mobile Explorer|publisher=Microsoft|year=2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various standardization bodies were established to help develop, oversee, and manage OTA.  One of them is the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA).

More recently, with the new concepts of [[Wireless Sensor Networks]] and the [[Internet of Things]], where the networks consist of hundreds or thousands of nodes, OTA is taken to a new direction: for the first time OTA is applied using unlicensed frequency bands (868&amp;nbsp;MHz, 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2400&amp;nbsp;MHz) and with low consumption and low data rate transmission using protocols such as [[802.15.4]] and [[ZigBee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gascón|first=David|title=Over the Air Programming with 802.15.4 and ZigBee - OTA|url=http://www.libelium.com/over_the_air_programming_OTA_802.15.4_ZigBee/|work=Libelium|publisher=Libelium|accessdate=28 May 2012|author2=Alberto Bielsa |author3=Félix Genicio |author4=Marcos Yarza |date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[sensor node|Motes]] are often located in places that are either remote or difficult to access. As an example, [[Libelium]] has implemented a smart and easy-to-use OTA programming system for [[ZigBee]] WSN devices. This system enables firmware upgrades without the need of physical access, saving time and money if the nodes must be re-programmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libelium.com 50 Sensor applications for a Smarter World. Get Inspired!|url=http://www.libelium.com/50_sensor_applications|work=Libelium.com|publisher=Libelium.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smartphones==
On modern [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, an '''over-the-air update''' may refer simply to a software update that is distributed over [[Wi-Fi]] or [[mobile broadband]] using a function built into the operating system, with the "over-the-air" aspect referring to its use of wireless internet instead of requiring the user to connect the device to a computer via [[USB]] to perform the update.

[[Patch (computing)|Firmware updates]] are available for download from the &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prestigio.com/news/firmware_updates/New_firmware_MultiPhone_4055_DUO&lt;/ref&gt; OTA service.

== Mechanism ==

The OTA mechanism requires the existing software and hardware of the target device to support the feature, namely the receipt and installation of new software received via the [[wireless telephony|wireless]] network from the provider.

New software is transferred to the phone, installed, and put into use. It is often necessary to turn the phone off and back on for the new programming to take effect, though many phones will automatically perform this action.

== Methods ==

Depending on implementation, OTA software delivery can be initiated upon action, such as a call to the provider's customer support system or other dialable service, or can be performed automatically. Typically it is done via the former method to avoid service disruption at an inconvenient time, but this requires subscribers to manually call the provider. Often, a carrier will send a broadcast [[Short message service|SMS]] text message to all subscribers (or those using a particular model of phone) asking them to dial a service number to receive a software update.

[[Verizon Wireless]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] provides a number of OTA functions to its subscribers via the *228 service code. Option 1 updates phone configuration, option 2 updates the [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]]. Similarly Voitel Wireless and StraightTalk, which both use Verizon network, use *22890 service code to program Verizon based wireless phones. [[Interop Technologies]] provides a number of nationwide wireless operators in the US with an SS7 Based Over-the-Air device management solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/wifirevolution/articles/24338-alaska-digitel-buys-ota-programming-solution-from-interop.htm |title=Alaska DigiTel Buys OTA Pgramming Solution from Interop Technologies |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution allows operators to manage wireless device functionality including renumbering handsets, updating phone settings, applications and subscriber data and adjusting [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]] to manage cost structures.

To provision parameters in a mobile device OTA, the device needs to have a provisioning client capable of receiving, processing and setting the parameters.  For example, a Device Management client in a device may be capable of receiving and provisioning applications, or connectivity parameters.

In general, the term OTA implies the use of wireless mechanisms to send provisioning data or update packages for firmware or software updates to a mobile device&amp;nbsp;— this is so that the user does not have to go to a store or a service center to have applications provisioned, parameters changed or firmware or software updated. Non-OTA options for a user are a) to go to a store and seek help b) use a PC and a cable to connect to the device and change settings on a device, add software to device, etc.

== OTA standards ==

There are a number of standards that describe OTA functions. One of the first was the [[GSM 03.48]] series.
The ZigBee suite of standards includes the ZigBee Over-the-Air Upgrading Cluster which is part of the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile and provides an interoperable (vendor-independent) way of updating device firmware.

== Similarities ==

OTA is similar to firmware distribution methods used by other mass-produced [[consumer electronics]], such as [[cable modem]]s, which use [[TFTP]] as a way to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing the amount of time spent by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.

Over-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is also available in wireless environments (though it is disabled by default for security reasons). It allows an access point (AP) to discover the IP address of its controller. When enabled, the controller tells the other APs to include additional information in the Radio Resource Management Packets (RRM) that would assist a new access point in learning of the controller. It is sent in plain text however, which would make it vulnerable to sniffing. That's why it is disabled by default.

'''Proto.io''' is an [[mobile application|application]] prototyping platform launched in 2011 and developed by the Labs Division of SNQ Digital.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/proto-io |title=Proto.io |author= |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=CrunchBase |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uxmag.com/resources/protoio-mobile-prototyping |title=Proto.io - Mobile Prototyping |author=Artemis Pattichi |date= |publisher=UX Magazine |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2012/06/07/mockup-tools/ |title=9 Excellent Tools for Design Mockups |author=Kelli Shaver |date=7 June 2012 |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed to prototype on mobile devices, Proto.io has expanded to allow users to prototype apps for anything with a screen interface, including [[smart TV|Smart TV’s]], [[digital camera]] interfaces, [[cars]], [[airplanes]], and [[gaming consoles]]. Proto.io utilizes a drag and drop user interface (UI) and does not require [[computer programming|coding]].&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netmagazine.com/features/20-best-new-tools-web-design-and-development-2012 |title=Mark Penfold Compiles a Top 20 From His Monthly Roundup of the Best New Tools That Saw the Light of Day This Year - and Many are Free! |author=Mark Penfold |date=12 December 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since its launch in 2011, there have been three versions of Proto.io released.

===Version 1===
In 2011, SNQ made the 100% web-based Proto.io tool available online.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UX" /&gt; The web-based environment allowed users to create a project for either the [[iPad]] or [[iPhone]]. After a user created a few screens for a developing app, Proto.io could then link those pages together with interactive actions that are custom to hand held devices, such as clicks, taps, tap and holds, and swipes.&lt;ref name="WF1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2011/10/proto-io-mobile-app-prototyping/ |title=Proto.io - Mobile App Prototyping |author=Alexis Piperides |date=13 October 2011 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aericon.com/blog/mobile-blog/fast-mobile-prototyping-with-proto-io/ |title=Fast Mobile Prototyping with Proto.io |author=Dean Whitney |date=28 November 2012 |publisher=AerIcon |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitaljournal.com/blog/19829#tab=comments&amp;sc=0 |title=Why Proto.io is a Revolution in Prototyping |author=Hayder Rehman |date=31 December 2012 |publisher=Digital Journal |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the platform, users could also create reusable templates into which prepackaged and editable elements could be dragged. Once the user had completed the prototype, Proto.io could then publish and preview the finished product not only on the web browser but also on the actual mobile device.&lt;ref name="WF1" /&gt;

===Version 2===

Proto.io V2 was released in early 2012 and expanded the supported mobile devices to accommodate for the Android platform, to include the Android Smartphone and Tablet. The platform also came with a newer user interface. Proto.io V2 also added collaboration features like comments and annotations as well as export to [[HTML]] functionality.&lt;ref name="WF2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2012/03/proto-io-v2-silly-fast-mobile-prototyping/ |title=Proto.io V2 - Silly-fast Mobile Prototyping |author= |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3===

On September 28, 2012, with the release of version 3 of the platform, Proto.io became the first prototyping tool to allow users to prototype on almost any device with a screen interface, and the first mobile prototyping tool to support full feature animations of user interface items within a prototype screen.&lt;ref name="WF3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2012/10/proto-io-v3-changes-mobile-prototyping-as-we-know-it/ |title=Proto.io V3 - Changes Mobile Prototyping As We Know It |author=Alexis Piperides |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Wireframes |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The included icon gallery contains thousands of SVG icons for use as buttons, lists and tab bars.&lt;ref name="DJ" /&gt; Proto.io V3 also supports web fonts, which allows the user to access all available online fonts.&lt;ref name="WF3" /&gt;

'''RailTel Corporation of India Ltd.''' is a "[[Miniratna]]" (public sector) enterprise of [[Government of India]] focusing on providing [[broadband]] and [[VPN]] services. RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of [[Indian Railways]]. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=100106 |title=RAILTEL Celebrates its Annual Day|date=18 October 2013 |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Indian government|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now [[BSNL]]) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and [[microwave]] signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce [[optical fibre cable]] (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC.

Indian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the [[Western line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)|Churchgate–Virar line]] in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60&amp;nbsp;km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in 1991–92 across Durg–Nagpur, Nagpur–Itarsi and Itarsi–Bhusaval sections of the [[Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line]], and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in [[Tatanagar–Bilaspur section|Tatanagar–Chakradhrapur section]] of the same line.

The second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a [[Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtelindia.com/profile/about-us.html Rural Broadband Connectivity Provider in India | RailTel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wi-Fi and WiMax===
RailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free [[WiFi]] access at selected railways stations across India. Google chose railway stations as the location to provide free WiFi because stations have access to reliable power supply and fibre provided by RailTel, and because the passengers at a station come from all demographics of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google teams up with RailTel to give free Wifi to all railway stations in India|url=http://www.indialivetoday.com/google-teams-up-with-railtel-to-give-free-wifi-to-all-railway-stations-in-india/16505.html|website=India Live Today|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free WiFi service was launched at [[Mumbai Central railway station]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-central-gets-googles-highspeed-wifi-network/article8140702.ece Mumbai Central gets Google's Wi-Fi network – The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the service was expanded to 9 more railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google, RailTel expand free WiFi reach, cover 9 more stations|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/google-railtel-expand-free-wifi-reach-cover-9-more-stations-116041500438_1.html|publisher=''[[Business Standard]]''|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Google announced that free Wi-Fi was available across 19 stations in India and was being used by over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians enjoy high Speed Wi-Fi across 19 Railway Stations|url=http://googleindia.blogspot.in/2016/06/15-million-indians-enjoy-high-speed-wi.html|website=Official Google India Blog|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google and RailTel plan to provide free WiFi at 100 railway stations across the country by the end of 2016.

In September 2016, Google announced a public WiFi initiative called Google Station. Google plans to expand free WiFi coverage under the initiative to locations such as cafes and malls across India, and later expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byford|first1=Sam|title=Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|website=The Verge|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Google announced that it's Free Wi-Fi project is now powering 400 Indian railway stations. As a result, there are now more than 8 million people accessing the internet each month via the project.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/google-says-free-wifi-available-at-400-railway-stations/articleshow/64492865.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railwire===
Based on its nationwide fibre network, RailTel offers various bandwidth intensive application to its customers. One such initiative is RailWire, a joint venture with MSOs to provide Voice, Video and Multimedia access on a single wire at a customer's home or office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RailTel to tie up with MSOs to expand internet base in rural T.N.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/railtel-to-tie-up-with-msos-to-expand-internet-base-in-rural-tn/article5387079.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 November 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date.

'''Yabacon Valley''' (YV) is a nickname for an area within [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]]. Yaba is a suburb of [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] and located at the mainland of the Lagos. This area is already growing as Nigeria’s technology hub and cluster of hundreds of banking institutions, educational institutions, technology and [[startup company|startup]] companies which steadily attracts angel investors, venture capitalists, enthusiasts and media people from all over the world. This cluster is the major reason many technology firms are considering opening up shops in Yaba.&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/yaba-joins-race-to-become-africas-silicon-valley/#.U7sbv5RdU8o|title=Yaba to become Africa's Silicon Valley|website=BusinessDay|author= Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to the region is the [[Lagos Lagoon]] which lies on its south-western side, it empties into the Atlantic via Lagos Harbor, a main channel through the heart of the city, 0.5&amp;nbsp;km to 1&amp;nbsp;km wide and 10&amp;nbsp;km long. The term originally was born from an unintentional act of an absent mind, manipulating the [[Silicon Valley]] name to create a nick version for this cluster while writing a story title.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"&gt;[http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/] from thebusinessaim.com.ng&lt;/ref&gt; More so, due to the [[lagoon]] near this region, the term Silicon lagoon has also been used to refer to this cluster although this is yet to stick and its origin or creator is unknown.

Regardless of the tech clusters in [[Africa]], Yabacon Valley (YV) or Silicon lagoon — whichever name you chose to call it — continues to be a leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, buoyed by the country’s budding, technology-savvy middle-class and massive online population of 45 million internet users. Nigeria’s fledgling technology start-up scene is witnessing a flurry of activities in the frame of new [[investment]] drive, acquisitions, strategic partnerships as well as plans to establish more incubation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/10/venture-capitalists-give-push-to-nigerias-technology-start-ups/#.U9tiSaN_3IU |title=Venture capitalists Propel Nigeria’s tech start-ups|publisher=BusinessDay|author=Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Yabacon Valley encompasses all Yaba Local Council Development area which was carved out of the old Lagos Mainland Local Government created in 1977 as a separate local government following the national reform of Local [[government]] in September 1976. The Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city [[council]] which administered the Lagos [[Metropolitan area|Metropolitan]] city consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former Lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it. The present Yaba Local Council Area has the look of an urban setting; some areas however mirror rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yabacon Valley is a development, a commercial nerve center for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

==Origin of term==
It is not known if the term ''Yabacon Valley'' has been mentioned or used in reference of this tech cluster in the past, but its first published use is credited to [http://www.thebusinessaim.com.ng The Business Aim], an online publishing platform with focus on business, strategy, innovation, startup culture and everything new. According to Google search results, the name was first used by ''Blaise Aboh'', then an award-winning editor, now [[Data analysis|Data Analysis]]/Design Lead and Founding Partner at [http://www.orodataviz.com Orodata Science Nigeria] a [[Civic technology]] organization as part of a title for an [http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/ article] on reasons for the arrival of startup accelerators, and also to announce the emergence of a new player named [http://passionincubator.ng Passion Incubator] in Yaba technology [[ecosystem]]. The article is dated 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"/&gt; The term is still not widely known however it is been used in conversations among the geeks, players and enthusiasts in the tech ecosystem especially on technology focused blogs and social media. There's still [[controversy]] surrounding the name, arguments and comments made on [http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/ article] a popular Nigerian technology blog [http://www.techcabal.com Techcabal] confirms this as few are disgruntled and think a better nickname can be created. They feel the name ought to be something else without the ‘con’ and the ‘valley’ arguing why Nigeria must mimic the west in almost everything. But there are many who actually like the name. Weekly in conversations, this name pops up and there are those who are of the [[opinion]] that if the name is disliked so much, it should not be brought up regularly.&lt;ref name="Lagos Angel Network makes first investment]"&gt;[http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/] from techcabal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2015, a tech blog's community post declared [https://radar.techcabal.com/t/yabacon-valley-is-dead-long-live-yaba-right/3376/34 Yabacon Valley is dead. Long live Yaba Right']. The conversation was about how the name Yabacon Valley was not a good branding of the tech cluster, and why other suggestions like 'Yaba Right' or 'Yaba District' or even 'Silicon Yaba' were more suitable names.  The Executive Director of [https://pinigeria.org/ Paradigm Initiative Nigeria (PIN)] a social enterprise, Gbenga Sesan in a comment said that 'If something wasn't broken, why fix it'? That the whole thing was but a fruitless argument. He was of the opinion that when the time was right, the right name would come, that 'instead of looking for a new name by all means, let all cities focus on real work without assumptions'. It must be noted that one person alone does not have the power to name a country, let alone a district. It comes from careful or careless deliberations, negotiation, discuss, or in the case of YV; incessant community debates and arguments over its origin, originality and suitability. 
  
Yabacon is a [[portmanteau]] of ‘Yaba’ the Lagos suburb and ‘Silicon’, a chemical element used to create most semiconductors commercially for [[electronic computer]]s. Although there are technology companies in this area, there are no companies involved in the making of semiconductors since the cluster is still at its green stage and [[Nigeria]] is yet to advance to the [[technology]] level of manufacturing electronics. Thus, the name is just a sheer but unconscious imitation of America's [[Silicon valley]]. The name Yabacon Valley (YV) is alive although proclaimed dead because the Yaba technology community made it a continuous topic of discussion on blogs, social media and community posts. The name was an ordinary creation of a creative writer while penning the title of an article. The tech community made it the monster it is today.

==Demographics==
The population of Yabacon Valley is between 200 and 300 thousand approximately. It is assumed that females outnumber males in the majority of the localities in Yabacon Valley due to concentration of tertiary institutions in the area.

==Boundaries==
North of this area is Shiro Street down to other side of Morocco road towards the roundabout. This also includes Abule- Ijesha South - Muritala Muhammed way from Jibowu to Wright street junction. To the East is the Lagos lagoon, Onike, Onitiri, Makoko, Iwaya, University of Lagos communities also overlooking lagoon. To the West; a descent of 3rd mainland bridge to Wright Street to Murtala Muhammed way to include Total services station at that junction.

==History==
Yaba is a part of Lagos Nigeria with many small towns and communities such as Onyigbo, Ebute metta, Makoko, Sabo, Akoka, Abule Ijesha, Onike, Jibowu, and Iwaya among others.

Yaba Local council development area as it is today has its secretariat at 198, Herbert Macaulay Street, carved out of the old Lagos Mainland local government which was created in 1977 as a separate Local government following the national reform of Local government in September 1976. Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city council which administered the Lagos Metropolitan city; this consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it.
Yaba Local council Development area as one of the Thirty Seven (37) newly created Local council Development areas was created out of Lagos Mainland by the administration of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu after the state assembly passed a law creating new local council Development areas.
The present Yaba local council area wears an urban setting; some part however mirrored rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yaba Local council development area is the commercial nerve centre for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

"Perhaps the strongest push responsible for this industrial powerhouse and cluster is the increase in demand of products leveraging technology for growth".

=== Presence of leading institutions of higher learning ===
Yabacon valley has two of Nigeria’s leading educational institutions in [[Yaba College of Technology]] (Yabatech) and [[University of Lagos]]. Both higher institutions are known to be of higher learning standards and have some of the country’s best brains as lecturers. There of course are the less seasoned institutions which are prestigious in their own right – the federal technical college Akoka (a teacher training institute) and Queens’ college one of Africa’s best post primary educational institutions.
Historical significance, landmarks and memorials. Yaba also has notable landmarks like the statue of Herbert Macaulay the father of nationalism in Nigeria. Many other landmarks such as Tejuosho Market, E-center, National library of Nigeria, Yabatech among other notable landmarks there are also historically significant landmarks, such as the tallest building on the mainland Corner stone house, the first filling station in Nigeria - (Total at Sabo) and many more.

=== An expanding middle class ===
Yaba has one of the fastest expanding middle class groups in Nigeria as a whole. This is why developers fall over themselves to renovate old buildings or expand them out rightly to create apartments for working class folks. Real estate boom is in no small way an issue to consider when middle-class families demand for accommodation.

===Reduced crime rate===
Crime rate in most parts of yaba is low. Perhaps the heavy presence of security details around the place deters criminals or could be that the ever busy nature of the place seems to inconvenience criminals. Also there is the possibility that many so called criminals may consider productive work readily available for idle hands to be more rewarding whatever the case crime rate is relatively low.

===Nearness to the island===
Lagos island is the nerve center of commerce and the service based industry in Nigeria as a whole. Living in Yaba keeps you close to the Victoria island, Ikoyi and Lekki and thereby reduces your transportation expenses, stress due to heavy traffic jams which has found common place in these aforementioned areas.

===Rapid economic expansion===
The local economy in this part of Lagos is rapidly expanding. Eateries, banks, hotels, retail stores, insurance companies, night clubs are booming implying a lot of opportunities both for investors and employment seekers. The expansion of this area is rapid and many companies are setting up so as to not miss out of its financial benefits.

===The birth and thrive of a startup cluster===
In 2011, Wennovation Hub in partnership with [[Africa Leadership Forum|African Leadership Forum]] started incubating startups in the tech ecosystem but not much noise was made till 2012 when [[Bosun Tijani]] a social innovator &amp; entrepreneur and a group of individuals set out to help animate a community of change agents who believe in building a strong base for Nigeria through technology. They were certain they could help accelerate a movement of people who are driven by the need to disrupt the status quo in Nigeria through smart application of technology. The name was later changed to [[Co-Creation Hub|Cc-HUB]], and it became Nigeria’s first startup incubator. With investment and support in cash and kind from organisations such as the Indigo Trust, Omidyar Network, MainOne Cable Company and the Lagos State government, it soon gained momentum and proceeded to install a fibre-optic-powered information superhighway. In 2011, former banker Seun Onigbinde co-founded BudgIT, a fiscal transparency project, on the third floor of CC Hub’s six-storey building in Yaba. As one of the first early-stage startups to benefit from CC Hub’s incubation drive in 2011, it received $5,000 of its $90,000 seed funding from billionaire businessman Tony Elumelu. Big names like Konga, eCommerce company valued at approximately $200 million as after raising $20 million in Series C rounds, arrived in 2013, while Africa Internet Group which has $469 million in 4 Rounds from six investors transferred six of its companies to Yaba in 2014. In same 2014 BudgIT received $400,000 grant from Omidyar. Mid 2016, Andela – a Nigerian-founded talent accelerator for programmers that has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi and New York – received $24 million in investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In 2015 Hotels.ng, which claims to be the largest hotel booking site in Nigeria secured $1.2 million in funding from Omidyar Network to expand its listings across Africa.

A number of startups including Iroko – the biggest digital retailer of Nollywood worldwide with total funding of $40 million – and Paystack, an alternative e-payments company which raised $1.3 million investment in December 2016 from international investors Tencent, Comcast Ventures and more, have offices outside the cluster but still intermingle with those from Yabacon Valley.

===The coming of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder===
A day after [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the founder of Facebook, a social media company with $350 billion market valuation walked on the streets of Yaba in Lagos Nigeria, local and international media went agog as to why Yaba is [https://www.thecable.ng/videos-zuckerberg-walks-freely-on-the-streets-of-yaba/ 'Nigeria's Silicon Valley'] after all. In Zuckerberg’s first visit to Africa, his first stop was at Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) in Yaba, Lagos, ground zero for start-ups in order to listen, learn and take ideas back to California on how Facebook can better support tech development and entrepreneurship across Africa. In a Facebook post he said; "the energy here is amazing and I’m excited to learn as much as I can, I’m looking forward to meeting more people in Nigeria" after he met and interacted with kids at a summer coding camp in CCHub, developers and entrepreneurs in the startup ecosystem in Nigeria. Then he went to Andela where his wife foundation Chan Zuckerberg foundation had made an investment months back. The visit was part of a series of global town hall meetings.
