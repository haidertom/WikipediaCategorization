'''After the Development of Agriculture''' ('''A.D.A.''') is a system for counting years forward from 8000 [[Common Era|BCE]]. It was developed in feminist [[thealogy]]. It is not often used.

Whether [[history of agriculture|agriculture began]] 8,000 years before the Common Era may not be agreed with among scholars, but it is close to some estimates. It also did not begin in all places at the same time.

The A.D.A. calendar system is not often used.

The '''Amik''', '''Amuk''', or '''Amuq''' '''Valley''' ({{lang-ar|الأعماق}} ''al-A’maq'') is located in the southern part of [[Turkey]], in the [[Hatay Province]], close to the city of [[Antakya]] ([[Antioch]] on the Orontes). Along with [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]] in north western [[Syria]], it is believed to be one of the future sites of the battle of [[Armageddon]] according to [[Islamic eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kerimusta.com/melhame-i-kubra-armageddon-savasi/ |title=MELHAME-İ KÜBRA (ARMAGEDDON) SAVAŞI  |access-date=2015-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102010/http://www.kerimusta.com/melhame-i-kubra-armageddon-savasi/ |archive-date=2015-12-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadislerde-mehdi.blogspot.com.tr/2014/08/melhame-i-kubra-ve-amik-ovas-gercegi.html Amik Ovası ve Armageddon Savaşı {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yeniakit.com.tr/yazarlar/abdurrahman-dilipak/isidin-nihai-hedefi-7940.html IŞİD’in nihai hedefi {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaybihaberleri.blogspot.com.tr/2013/02/melhame-i-kubra-buyuk-savas.html MELHAME-İ KÜBRA / BÜYÜK SAVAŞ {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yazete.com/genc-kalemler/mesut-akbaba/buyuk-savas-melhamei-kubra/2191/ Büyük savaş melhamei kübra {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Eschatology==
[[Abu Hurayrah]], a [[sahabi|companion]] of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], reported in a [[hadith]] that the Prophet said:

{{quote|The Last Hour would not come until the Romans land at al-A’maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of Earth at that time will come from [[Medina]] (to counteract them).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonlyquran.com/hadith/Sahih-Muslim/?volume=41&amp;chapter=9 Sahih-Muslim Hadith, Vol. 41, Chap. 9, Hadith 6924, per Abu Huraira] from Quran/Hadith study site: [http://www.theonlyquran.com/index.php The Only Quran]. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Islamic scholar]]s and hadith commentators suggest that the word ''Romans'' refers to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farzana Hassan|title=Prophecy and the Fundamentalist Quest: An Integrative Study of Christian and Muslim Apocalyptic Religion|date=15 Jan 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786480791|page=41|edition=illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hadith further relates the subsequent Muslim victory, followed by the peaceful takeover of [[Constantinople]] with invocations of [[takbir]] and [[tasbih]], and finally the defeat of the [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Anti-Christ]] following the return and descent of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farzana Hassan|title=Prophecy and the Fundamentalist Quest: An Integrative Study of Christian and Muslim Apocalyptic Religion|date=15 Jan 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786480791|pages=41–2|edition=illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=The Meaning and Explanation of the Glorious Qur'an (Vol 2)|date=2009|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|isbn=9781861797667|pages=311–12|edition=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other hadiths relate the appearance of [[Imam Mahdi]] immediately before the [[Second Coming of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sonn (2004) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{IAST|Anekāntavāda}}''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:अनेकान्तवाद|अनेकान्तवाद]]}}, "many-sidedness") refers to the [[Jainism|Jain]] doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient [[India]].{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=325-326, 342}} It states that the ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | editor =Tara Sethia | title =Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =2004 | location =Delhi | pages =123–136 | isbn =81-208-2036-3 | chapter =Beyond Anekāntavāda : A Jain approach to religious tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anekantavada has also been interpreted to mean non-absolutism, "intellectual Ahimsa",{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=324}} [[religious pluralism]],{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=36}} as well as a rejection of fanaticism that leads to terror attacks and mass violence.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor=Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=85–88 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that modern revisionism has attempted to reinterpret anekantavada with religious tolerance, openmindedness and pluralism.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-334}}

According to [[Jainism]], no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. This knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]''), it adds, is comprehended only by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi |page=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge claims, according to the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.

The origins of ''anekāntavāda '' can be traced back to the teachings of [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] (599–527 [[BCE]]), the 24th Jain {{IAST|''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankara]]''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3}} The [[dialectic]]al concepts of ''syādvāda'' "conditioned viewpoints" and ''nayavāda'' "partial viewpoints" arose from ''anekāntavāda'' in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-2}}

==Etymology==
The word ''anekāntavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words: ''anekānta'' and ''vāda''. The word ''anekānta'' itself is composed of three root words, "an" (not), "eka" (one) and "anta" (end, side), together it connotes "not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness", or "manifoldness".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name= "grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vāda'' means "doctrine, way, speak, thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), "वाद", Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, pages 939-940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBSn4dR087YC |year=1982|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''anekāntavāda'' is translated by scholars as the doctrine of "many-sidedness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F. Gier|title=Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b0uIvu4aBuMC |year= 2000|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0-7914-4528-0|pages=80, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O9JlrJ1wwAC |year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9131-9|pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; "non-onesidedness",{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=1}} or "many pointedness".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

The term ''anekāntavāda'' is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

==Philosophical overview==
The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', also known as ''anekāntatva'', states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''naya'', or "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} Language  is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it still remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}

The ''anekāntavāda'' premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''Nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}}

The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', according to Bimal Matilal, states that "no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=2}} For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (''syadvada'') or limitations (''nayavada'', standpoints).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3, 30-32, 52-54}}

===Syādvāda===

''Syādvāda'' ({{lang-sa|स्याद्वाद}}) is the theory of ''conditioned predication'', the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word ''syāt'' ({{lang-sa|स्यात्}}), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb ''as'' ({{lang-sa|अस्}}), 'to be', and which becomes ''syād'' when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with ''sandhi''. The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc.  It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc.  The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'.  The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.

Syat can be translated into English as meaning "perchance, may be, perhaps" (it is).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}  The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense.  For example, sutra 1.4.96 of [[Pāṇini|Panini]]'s Astadhyayi explains it as signifying "a chance, maybe, probable".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}

In Jainism, however, ''syadvada'' and ''anekanta'' is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is "conditional yes or conditional approval" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase ''syad etat'',  meaning "let it be so, but", or "an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise".  This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of ''syad etat''.  Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=93–95 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context ''syadvada'' does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means "multiplicity or multiple possibilities".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} ''Syat'' in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a "many sidedness" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;

''Syādvāda'' is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=90–92 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or "[[Jaina seven-valued logic|the theory of sevenfold scheme]]".&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; These ''saptibhaṅgī'' seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=230}} and they are:&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "grimes"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=29}}
#Affirmation: ''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#Denial: ''syān-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#Joint but successive affirmation and denial: ''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,

Each of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt; The phrase ''syāt'' declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]''), place (''kṣetra''), time (''kāla''), and being (''bhāva''), and negation with regard to other substance (''dravya''), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (''bhāva''). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (''dravya'') – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (''kṣetra'') – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}} In regard to time (''kāla'') – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (''bhāva'') – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}}

According to [[Acharya Samantabhadra|Samantabhadra]]'s text ''Āptamīmāṁsā'' (Verse 105), "''Syādvāda'', the doctrine of conditional predications, and ''kevalajñāna'' (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while ''kevalajñāna'' illumines directly, ''syādvāda'' illumines indirectly".{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 163}} ''Syadvada'' is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 174}}

===Nayavāda===

''Nayavāda'' ({{lang-sa|नयवाद}}) is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation") and ''vāda'' ("doctrine, thesis").&lt;ref name="Grimes202"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 198, 202–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt; Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}

According to Jainism, there are seven ''nayas'' or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using ''syadvada''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}} These seven ''naya'', according to [[Umaswati]], are:{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 119, 198–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt;
#Naigama-naya: common sense or a universal view
#Samgraha-naya: generic or class view that classifies it
#Vyavahara-naya: pragmatic or a particular view assesses its utility
#Rijusutra-naya: linear view considers it in present time
#Sabda-naya: verbal view that names it
#Samabhirudha-naya: etymological view uses the name and establishes it nature
#Evambhuta-naya: actuality view considers its concrete particulars

The ''naya'' theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of ''nayavada'' concept in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}}

A particular viewpoint is called a ''naya'' or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, ''Nayavada'' does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A ''naya'' reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (''syādvāda'').{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=28}}

===Jiva, the changing soul===
[[File:Mahavra 1900 art.jpg|thumb|Mahāvīra did not use the word ''anekāntavada'', but his teachings contain the seeds of the concept (painting from [[Rajasthan]], ca. 1900)]]
Ancient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'' (self, matter) utilizes ''anekantavada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Benesch|title=An Introduction to Comparative Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEWDAAAQBAJ |year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-59738-9|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H.

The [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of ''[[Brahman]]'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of [[anatta]] (no-self).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with ''anekāntavāda''.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}; Quote: "To counter the proponents of these diametrically opposed positions [Buddhist and Hindu], Jains developed a position knows as syadvada [seeud-VAH-duh], the way or path of "perhaps, maybe or somehow." Syadvada states simply that judgments resting on different points of view may differ without any of them being wholly wrong. [...] A limited and incomplete judgment is called a naya [nuh-yuh], and all human knowledge is a compilation of nayas, judgments resulting from different attitudes. The Jains were thus able to accept equally the Hindu views of "being" and Buddhist views of "becoming," but took neither in the sense that their partisan advocates desired or found comforting. [...] The Jain doctrine of syadvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that Jainism is the right religious path."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvind" &gt;[[Arvind Sharma|Sharma, Arvind]] (2001) Preface xii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as ''ekantika'' or only partially true.&lt;ref&gt;Sethia, Tara (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;Burch, George (1964) pp. 68–93&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through ''anekānta'' has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as [[Arvind Sharma]], who wrote:&lt;ref name="Arvind"/&gt;
{{Quote|Our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially, but not philosophically. This paradox is the paradox of change. Something – A changes and therefore it cannot be permanent. On the other hand, if A is not permanent, then what changes? In this debate between the "permanence" and "change", Hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and Buddhism the second. It is Jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously, and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either.}}

===Inclusivist or exclusivist===
Some Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in "exclusivist term as the one true path".&lt;ref name=sethia123/&gt; Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be "heterodox and heretics" and that they "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]]".&lt;ref name=sethia123&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be "approved or accommodated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Koller states ''anekāntavāda'' to be "epistemological respect for view of others" about the nature of existence whether it is "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but "not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".&lt;ref name="koller89"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps, just one perspective".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

==History and development==
The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' is one of the foundational [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept. The development of ''anekāntavāda'' also encouraged the development of the dialectics of ''syādvāda'' (conditioned viewpoints) and ''nayavāda'' (partial viewpoints).

According to Karl Potter, the Jain ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt; The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that "unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with [[Anatta]] (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (''jiva'') and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.&lt;ref name=johnson232/&gt;&lt;ref name=potter114&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0779-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The origins of ''anekāntavāda'' are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.&lt;ref name="bhagvati"&gt;Charitrapragya, Samani (2004) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Early Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-62}} According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial ''anekantavada'' doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}} These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}}

The early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. ''Śvētāmbara'' text, ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'' contains references to ''Vibhagyavāda'', which, according to [[Hermann Jacobi]], is the same as ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī''.&lt;ref name="sutra"&gt;Jacobi, Hermann (1895) 14:21–22&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted ''vibhagyavada'' as ''syadvada'', the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text ''[[Sutrakritanga]]''.&lt;ref name="jacobi327"/&gt; However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jaina-canon Jaina canon], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|

According to Upadhyaye, the ''Bhagvatisūtra'' (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the ''saptibhaṅgīnaya''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye"&gt;Upadhyaye, A. N. (2001) pp. 6136–37&lt;/ref&gt; This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina/&gt;

The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Slaje| title=Śāstrārambha: Inquiries Into the Preamble in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C| year=2008| publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn=978-3-447-05645-8|page=35 with footnote 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digambara scholar [[Kundakunda]], in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī'' in ''Pravacanasāra'' and  ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pancastikayasāra]]''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye" /&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} Kundakunda also used ''nayas'' to discuss the essence of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] in ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]''. Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on ''anekantavada'' to the late 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=107-109}}

===Parable of the blind men and elephant===
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|Seven blind men and an elephant parable]]
The Jain texts explain the ''anekāntvāda'' concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R.

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

This parable is called ''Andha-gaja-nyaya'' maxim in Jain texts.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=40–43 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Jain references to this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century).&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt;

===Medieval developments===

Ācārya [[Haribhadra]] (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of ''anekāntavāda''. He wrote a [[doxography]], a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work ''Purusathasiddhiupaya'' with strong praise for ''anekāntavāda'': "I bow down to the principle of ''anekānta'', the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity."&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. P. (2006) Verse no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in ''Tattvarthaslokavārtikka'', 116:&lt;ref&gt;T. W. Rhys Davids (1980) pp. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|[[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]]}}, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond ''anekāntavāda'' by advocating ''madhāyastha'', meaning "standing in the middle" or "equidistance". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. C. (2001) p. 1487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient [[Indian philosophy]], in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref name = "McEvilley-p335"&gt;McEvilley, Thomas (2002) p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemology of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.

While employing ''anekāntavāda'', the 17th century Jain scholar [[Yasovijaya]] stated that it is not ''anābhigrahika'' (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In Jain belief, ''anekāntavāda'' transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Wright  | first =J.

===Role in Jain history===

''Anekāntavāda'' played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from [[Saiva|Śaiva]]s, [[Vaishnava|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslim]]s, and [[Christian]]s at various times. According to John Koller, professor of [[Asian studies]], ''anekāntavāda'' allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of [[Haribhadra]] justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=335-336, 338-339}}

There is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of "benevolence and tolerance" towards others.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=340-341}}

===Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi===
Mahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal ''[[Young India]] – 21 Jan 1926''. According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the "reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of [[Brahman]]", and his view of "Hindu religious pluralism":{{sfn|Long|2013|p=169}}&lt;ref name = "hay"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hay | first =Stephen N. | editor = Sibnarayan Ray | title =Gandhi India and the World | publisher =Nachiketa Publishers | year =1970 | location =Bombay | pages =14–23 | chapter =Jain Influences on Gandhi's Early Thought }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I am an [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitist]] and yet I can support [[Dvaita|Dvaitism]] (dualism). The world is changing every moment, and is therefore unreal, it has no permanent existence. But though it is constantly changing, it has a something about it which persists and it is therefore to that extent real. I have therefore no objection to calling it real and unreal, and thus being called an ''Anekāntavadi'' or a ''Syādvadi''. But my ''Syādvāda'' is not the ''Syādvāda'' of the learned, it is peculiarly my own. I cannot engage in a debate with them. It has been my experience that I am always true from my point of view, and am often wrong from the point of view of my honest critics.

===Against religious intolerance and contemporary terrorism===
Referring to the [[September 11 attacks]], John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that ''anekāntavāda'' is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.&lt;ref name="Johnkoller"&gt;Koller, John (2004) pp. 85–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Scott R.|date=2014-07-03|title=Anekāntavāda and Engaged Rhetorical Pluralism: Explicating Jaina Views on Perspectivism, Violence, and Rhetoric | journal= Advances in the History of Rhetoric |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15362426.2014.933721 | volume=17|issue =2|pages=131–156|doi= 10.1080/15362426.2014.933721| issn= 1536-2426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|James William Jones|2008}}

According to Sabine Scholz, the application of the ''Anekantavada'' as a religious basis for "intellectual Ahimsa" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that ''Anekantavada'' is an expression of "religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against "intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism".&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Scholz|editor=Julia A. B. Hegewald and Subrata K. Mitra|title=Re-Use-The Art and Politics of Integration and Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZqHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0981-5|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as [[John E. Cort]] and [[Paul Dundas]] state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as "religious tolerance of other opinions" is a "misreading of the original doctrine". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}}&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt; John Cort states that the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or "intellectual Ahimsa". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present "Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-331}} According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of "accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=333-334}}

According to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" in self-defense would not lose any merit.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}} N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and ''Anekantavada'' doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.L. Jain|editor=Colette Caillat and Nalini Balbir|title=Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecKCrO6nLiAC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3247-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;

==Comparison with non-Jain doctrines==
According to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that "Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (''anekāntika'') truth" while for Buddhism this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagchandra Jain; ''The Rudiments Of Anekāntavāda In Early Pali Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, states Jayatilleke, "no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions."&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are ''anekamsika'' (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the [[Four Noble Truths]], while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the [[The unanswered questions|avyakata-theses]].&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"/&gt; Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as ''satkaryavada'', ''asatkaryavada'', ''avirodhavada'' and others.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gaudapadiya-Karika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0904-7|pages=194–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anekantavada'' overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is ''satkaryavada'' in explaining causes, and the ''asatkaryavada'' in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=133, see Causal Models}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] further elaborated and refined the theory of ''[[pramana]]s'' and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Julius Lipner]]|title=The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Ramanuja|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjR2xuu4L8EC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-038-0|pages=82–89, 133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Indologists]] such as professor [[John E. Cort]] state that ''anekāntavāda'' is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}} According to [[Paul Dundas]], in Jain hands, this method of analysis became "a fearsome weapon of philosophical [[polemic]] with which the doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be".&lt;ref Name="Dundas192"&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of ''Anekantavada'' self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.&lt;ref Name="Dundas192" /&gt;

The doctrines of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādavāda'' are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is ''anekāntavāda'' true or false?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Webb | first =Mark Owen | title =The Jain Philosophy | work =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm#H4 | accessdate = 2008-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302171025/http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pandya, V. (2001) p. 5210&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just "compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

===Hindu philosophies===
====Nyaya====
The [[Nyaya]] school criticized the Jain doctrine of ''anekantavada'', states Karl Potter, as "wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, "jiva and ajiva are not related" and "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that ''jiva'' attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of ''anekantavada'' makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year= 1991|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn= 978-81-208-0779-2|pages=145–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaisheshika====
The [[Vaisheshika]] and [[Shaivism]] school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for [[moksha]] meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under ''Anekantavada'' doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

====Vedanta====
''Anekāntavāda'' was analyzed and critiqued by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Śankarācārya]] (~800 CE) in his ''bhasya'' on ''[[Brahmasutra]]'' (2:2:33–36):&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1992) pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that ''anekantavada'' doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: ''virodha'' (contradictions) and ''samsaya'' (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

{{Quote|
It is impossible that contradictory attributes such as being and non-being should at the same time belong to one and the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment. The third alternative expressed in the words — they either are such or not such — results in cognition of indefinite nature, which is no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is. Thus the means of knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act of knowledge become all alike indefinite. How can his followers act on a doctrine, the matter of which is altogether indeterminate? The result of your efforts is perfect knowledge and is not perfect knowledge. Observation shows that, only when a course of action is known to have a definite result, people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be listened any more than a drunken or a mad man.
|Adi Shankara, ''Brahmasutra'', 2.2:33–36}}

Shankara's criticism of ''anekantavada'' extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The problem with ''anekantavada'' doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be "certain that everything is uncertain". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

Contemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of ''Anekantavada'' does reject some versions of the "law of non-contradiction", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=42–43 with footnotes 15 and 16}}, '''Quote:''' "This is the sense in which it is correct to say that the Jainas reject the "law of non-contradiction".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
The Buddhist scholar [[Shantarakshita|Śāntarakṣita]], and his student Kamalasila, criticized ''anekantavada'' by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise "jivas (souls) do not exist". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=57}} According to Santaraksita, Jains state that "jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively", but if so debates Santaraksita, "jiva cannot change". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to "jiva don't exist".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the "fallacy of division".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

The Buddhist logician [[Dharmakirti]] critiqued ''anekāntavāda'' as follows:{{sfn|Pandya|2001}}
{{Quote|With the differentiation removed, all things have dual nature. Then, if somebody is implored to eat curd, then why he does not eat camel?" The insinuation is obvious; if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from the nature of a camel, then one is justified in eating camel, as by eating camel, he is merely eating the negation of curd.|Dharmakirti, ''Pramānavarttikakārika''}}

===Self-criticism in Jain scholarship===
The medieval era Jain logicians [[Akalanka]] and [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyananda]], who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his ''Pramanasamgraha'' acknowledges seven problems when ''anekantavada'' is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (''vaiyadhi karanya''), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}} Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of ''vyatikara'' (cross breeding in ideas) and ''apratipatti'' (incomprehensibility). [[Prabhācandra]], who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in ''anekantavada'' application.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

[[Image:Tertullian Codex Balliolensis 79.jpg|thumb|widthpx|A manuscript of Tertullian's ''Apologeticus'' from the 1440s.]]
'''''Apologeticus''''' ({{lang-la|Apologeticum}} or ''Apologeticus'')&lt;ref&gt;The early texts do not agree on the title (Bardenhewer).&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Tertullian]]'s most famous work,&lt;ref&gt;Unlike the very scattered and imperfect manuscripts of Tertullian, "only the ''Apologeticum'' has come down in numerous codices, some of them quite ancient" (Bardenhewer).&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of [[apologetic]] and [[polemic]]. In this work Tertullian defends [[Christianity]], demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated as all other sects of the [[Roman Empire]]. It is in this treatise that one finds the phrase: "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church" (''Apologeticus'', Chapter 50).

There is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian's ''[[Ad nationes]]''—published earlier in the same year—and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of ''Apologeticus''. There arises also the question of similarity to [[Minucius Felix]]'s dialogue ''Octavius''. Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.

Tertullian's brief ''De testimonio animae'' ("Concerning the Evidences of the Soul") is an appendix to the ''Apologeticus'', intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase ''testimonium animae naturaliter christianae'' in chapter  17).

==Authorship==
Not much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a [[Catholic Priest|presbyter (priest)]] of the Catholic Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. "No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage… It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage," Wright argues, "that Tertullian most securely belongs".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Catholic Church in favor of the [[Montanism|Montanist movement]], which he remained a part of for at least 10–15 years of his active life&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 1029&lt;/ref&gt; and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.

==Date==
''Apologeticus'', his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of 197 AD,&lt;ref&gt;"The actual date is doubtful or much disputed; there are no certain points of comparison" (Bardenhewer).&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of [[:Septimius Severus]]. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian's conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195.&lt;ref&gt;"Tertullian"  A Dictionary of World History. Oxford University Press, 2000. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  University of Chicago.  2 June 2012  http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t48.e3594&lt;/ref&gt; It was written before the [[Septimius_Severus#Reputed_persecution_of_Christians|edict of Septimius Severus]] (202 AD), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.

==Addressees and audience==
This work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- "that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters"— and thus bears resemblance to the [[Apologue|Greek apologues]]. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads "for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens".&lt;ref&gt;"Tertullian, Quintus Septimius Florens"  The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  University of Chicago.  4 June 2012  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t95.e5690&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian's defense against rationalizations and rumours and who  "would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian’s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 1036&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
''Apologeticus'' has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting "from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 1036&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian's modern editor [[:Otto Bardenhewer]] further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, "a model of judicial discussion". Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.

==Summary of ''Apologeticus''==
The following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider's translation of ''Apologeticus''.

===Introduction and addressing of unjust treatment of the Christians (Chapters 1–6)===
The first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not.&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.3 §1&lt;/ref&gt; To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name "Christian". Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.

In addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions [[:Nero]], and to a certain extent [[:Domitian]], as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning "some magnificent good".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.5 §1&lt;/ref&gt; He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that "restrained extravagance and bribery", "protected their [women's] modesty and sobriety", of the "conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.6 §1&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the "crimes" committed by the Christians.

===Charges based on rumor answered (Chapters 7–9)===
Tertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It's all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. 

Of the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.

===Charges of more "manifest crimes" answered (Chapters 10–45)===

Of the more "manifest crimes", as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring "for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues' images."&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.22 §6&lt;/ref&gt; In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argue, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. 

Christians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out "God" despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses, who was 1000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Roman literature tradition, to many others key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became "so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.21 §5&lt;/ref&gt; Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, "his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to ‘united’) with God".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.21 §14&lt;/ref&gt; Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason.  

To the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; "We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.30 §4&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God’s hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.

Tertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.

===Portrait of Christian society and of philosophy (Chapters 39–47)===
Tertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they "bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.42 §2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, "in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.45 §7&lt;/ref&gt; He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, "it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.46 §2&lt;/ref&gt; He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.

===Concluding considerations and remarks===
Tertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says "Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God".&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Ch.50 §12 and 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cmje mou.jpg|thumb|The founding of CMJE]]

The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement (CMJE) is made possible through help from the Righteous Persons Foundation and the relationship between [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] (HUC), the Omar Ibn Al Khattab Foundation and [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s Center for Religion and Civic Culture at the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences. The foresight of USC President [[Steven Sample|Steven B.

'''Ceremonial drums''' are used in a ritual context by indigenous peoples around the world, often accompanied by singing or chanting.

In the circumpolar regions the drums have been classified by traits such as the knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with external knobs. Drums with internal knobs are found amongst the [[Chukchi people|Tjuktjer]] in Asia and among North American [[Inuit]]. Drums with external knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types:
* West Siberian: ([[Khant peoples|Khant]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]])
* South Siberian: (groups living above and in the mid regions of the [[Yenisei River]]). This type has many variations (Sajano-Yeniseic, Sjoric, Altaic)
* Mid Siberian: This type has two variants, Evenki-Yakutic and Nganasans-Entsic.
* Middle East: ([[Nanay]]ians, [[Udegey]]ians, [[Ulch people|Ulchians]], [[Nivkhs|Nivkhians]], [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Evenk peoples|Evenkians]], [[Buryats]]ians, [[Yukagir]]ians, [[Dolgans|Dolganians]], [[Oroch people|Orochs]], [[Oroks|Orokians]], [[Negidals|Negidalians]] and [[Zabaykalska Evenkians]], that is [[Evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where two types are characteristic: Amursic and Zabaykalic)

&lt;!--
* South Siberian type (groups living above and mid regions of the Jenisej river) and has many variations (Sajano-Jenisejska, Sjoriska, Altaiska)
* Mid Siberian type with two variants (Evenkic-Jakutic and Nganasansic-Entsic)
* Middle East type (Nanajer, Udegejer, Ultjer, Nivcher, Ainu, Evenker, Burjater, Jukagirer, Dolganer, Orotjer, Oroker, Negidaler and Zabajkalska Evenkians, i.e. [[evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where also two types are characteristic: Amurska and Zabajkalska)
--&gt;

The historical [[Sami people|Saami]] drum, sometimes termed [[rune drum]], belonged to the South Siberian kind, Sajano-Yeniseic subtype. (Those are, however, very similar to the Sjoric subtypes.) The Sami word for drum is 'goavddis', 'goabdes ' or 'gievrie' and the Altaic term is 'komus'. The Sami drum-stick term is 'bállin'; the Altaic term is 'orba'. 

&lt;!-- And finally, the Sami term for shaman is naida (noajdde); the Mansi term is nait. The Saami drums are further divided into the following classes:
* Frame drum
** Svept frame drum (or Åsele type) -
** Ring drum -
** Angle drum -

'''''Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man''''' (original French: ''Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond'') is a dialogue written by the [[Marquis de Sade]] while incarcerated at the [[Château de Vincennes]] in 1782. It is one of the earliest known written works from de Sade to be dated with certainty, and was first published in 1926 together with an edition of ''[[Historiettes, Contes et Fabliaux]]'' (written originally in 1788). It was subsequently published in English in 1927 by [[Pascal Covici]] in a limited, hand-numbered edition of 650 copies.

==Plot==
The work expresses the author's [[atheism]] by having a dying man (a [[libertine]]) tell a priest about what he views as the mistakes of a [[pious]] life.

According to John Phillips, Emeritus Professor of French Literature and Culture at London Metropolitan University:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of all the direct expressions of atheism in Sade's work, the ''Dialogue''... is probably the most incisive and, at the same time, the most artistically satisfying... The influence of Sade's Jesuit training in rhetorical debate is the mainspring of this brilliant dramatic essay, which, as the title suggests, is not so much theatre as philosophical dialogue. But what makes the work charming as well as persuasive is the impish humour that lies behind its characters and situation.&lt;ref name=phillips2005&gt;Phillips, John (2005). ''The Marquis de Sade: a very short introduction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp.37-38. {{ISBN|0-19-280469-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Steven Barbone, of [[San Diego State University]] notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We can postulate one of two things: Sade was entirely pleased with this manuscript and saw no reason to make any changes to it or Sade completely gave up on the dialogue and had decided to abandon it. The reason for either of these hypotheses is that the manuscript itself contains almost no trace of Sade’s editing. It is up to the reader to divine whether the “Dialogue between the Priest and a Dying Man” is Sade’s position or not. Either way, it is worth reading even in the very unlikely event that it presents a position Sade would have repudiated. (This may be the case: near the beginning  of  October  1788,  Sade  himself  made  a  catalogue  of  his works, and the “Dialogue” is omitted.)  &lt;ref name=barbone2000&gt;de Sade, Donatien-Alphonse-François.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication history==

Sade completed the notebook which contains the Dialogue on 12 July 1782, while imprisoned at [[Château de Vincennes]].&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; He took the manuscript with him when he was transferred to the [[Bastille]] in 1784.&lt;ref name=barbone2000 /&gt;{{rp|343}}

Following the [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July [[1789]], Sade's prison writings disappeared (Sade had been moved to [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]] on 4 July), the manuscript of the Dialogue among them. However, it survived in private collections and was sold on at auction a number of times during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; On 6 November 1920 it was bought by [[Maurice Heine]] at an auction at the [[Hôtel Drouot]], [[Paris]], and he oversaw its publication in France for the first time in 1926 &lt;ref name=heine&gt;de Sade, Donatien-Alphonse-François, Marquis.

===English translations===

The first English translation was published in the United States by [[Pascal Covici]] in 1927, again in a limited edition of 650 numbered copies.&lt;ref name=walter2001note /&gt; The translator was [[Samuel Putnam]].  This edition was based on the first French edition and included a translation of Heine's introduction.&lt;ref name=putnam&gt;de Sade, Marquis. ''Dialogue between a Priest and a Dying Man.'' Translated by Samuel Putnam. Chicago: P. Covici, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, [[E.

Buñuel had previously adapted ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' into a scene in his earlier ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' (1930) and would go on to feature the Marquis himself as a character in ''[[The Milky Way (1969 film)|La Voie Lactée]]'' (1969).

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

===The Wiccan Rede===
"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===
[[File:Leaf at Rocky Point of McDonald Lake.jpg|thumb]]
This term is what [[Emma Restall Orr]] calls reverence for the earth in her book ''Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics''. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;&lt;ref name="WFT Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFT Ethics|url=http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/wft-ethics|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment.

This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]'s [[coregency]] marked the end of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the reign of [[James II of England]]. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious [[paradigm]] of 17th-century England, which was [[Roman Catholic]] when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the "vile pop'ry" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of [[Protestant]] liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacCubbin |first1=Robert P. |last2=Hamilton-Phillips |first2=Martha |last3=College of William and Mary|last4=Grolier Club|last5=Folger Shakespeare Library|date=1990 |title=The Age of William III &amp; Mary II: Power, Politics and Patronage, 1688-1702 : A Reference Encyclopedia and Exhibition Catalogue |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |isbn=0962208108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant copies of the ballad are available at [[Magdelene College]] in the [[Pepys Library]].

==Synopsis==
Set to the tune of "Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EBBA|title=Recording of ''England's Triumph'' sung to the tune of ''Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar''|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20887/recording|website=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ballad opens with an [[encomium]] directed toward King William III: "Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation." The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is "seated on the throne": "The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the "[[Whore of Babylon|Babylonian Dame]]" mentioned in these lines, was [[English Reformation|once again no longer the official religion of England]]. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: "May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing."

==Form==
The ballad is broken up into eight [[:wikt:octet|octets]] with varying [[rhyme scheme]]s. For instance, the first stanza has an ''AA BB CCC B'' rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an ''AAA B CCC B'' rhyme scheme.

[[Ethics]] involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ethics is "the good life", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional [[Morality|moral]] conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1993) ''Practical Ethics'', 2nd edition (p.10), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[religion]]s have an [[ethics|ethical]] component, often derived from purported supernatural [[revelation]] or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who "would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist ethics==
{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}
Ethics in [[Buddhism]] are traditionally based on the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in [[Buddhist scriptures]] or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]]: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see [[vinaya]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the ''vinaya'', but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the [[Middle Way]]) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity'' (Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has observed:
:"Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the "immeasurables" — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (1994). For other examples of Buddhist discourses that promote ethical behaviors among laity see, for instance, the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] (referred to as "the [[Vinaya]] of the householder" by [[Buddhaghosa]]) and the [[Dhammika Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Christian ethics}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Mount|The New Commandment|Ministry of Jesus}}

Christian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly [[Virtuous#Christian tradition|virtuous]] in both thought and deed, see also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from [[vice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Christian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the [[Bible]]. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will.  God's will can be summed up by the precept: "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself", commonly called the [[Great Commandment]]. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society.  Christian ethics has a [[teleological]] aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the [[Kingdom of God]]—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the [[Old Testament]]’s [[Ten Commandments]], and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Christian ethics is not substantially different from [[Jewish ethics]], except in the exhortation to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It has been argued (see [[Ched Myers]]'s ''Binding the Strong Man'', and [[John Howard Yoder]]'s ''The Politics of Jesus'') that Jesus was waging a [[Nonviolent revolution|non-violent campaign]] against the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Roman oppressors]] and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--[[turn the other cheek]], go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.

Other tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13}}). Other schema include the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] and the [[Seven virtues]]. For more see [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

==Confucian ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Confucianism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or [[situational ethics]]. The Confucian system differs very strongly from [[Kantian ethics]] in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in [[Zhou Dynasty]] China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of [[Mozi]] argued for universal love ({{Zh|s=兼爱|p=jiān ài}}). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that [[Mao Zedong]] was more Confucian than Communist.
Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by [[Mencius]] ({{Zh|s=孟子|p=mèng zĭ}}), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) "acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses [[honesty]] above all. His concepts of [[lĭ]] ({{Zh|s=理}}), [[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]] ({{Zh|s=義}}), and [[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]] ({{Zh|s=仁}}) can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty ({{Zh|s=誠|p=[[chéng]]|l=[[sincerity]]}}) and [[fidelity]] ({{Zh|s=孝|p=[[xiào]]}}) to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid [[property rights]], hard to distinguish from any other [[dictatorship]]. Traditional ethics had been perverted by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]].

===Buddhist influence===
Buddhism, and specifically [[Mahayana Buddhism]], brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the [[Tang dynasty]], and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Daoist ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Laozi]] (Lao Tzu) and other [[Daoist|Taoist]] (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' 禮), culture (''[[Chinese culture|wen]]'' 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater ''sense of being'' and less identification with ''the act of''  ''doing''.  Taoist ''passivity'' nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows ''the majestic'' and ''the real'' to shine, which influences society for the better.    - "If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.  Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."   - Lao Tzu

Kane]], the author of the [[History of Dharmaśāstra|History of Dharmasastra]] said, the term "Dharma" does not have a synonym in English language. While it is often interpreted as meaning "duty", it can mean justice, right, moral, good, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kane, P.V.

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};

Ethics that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K.

The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The Persian historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 1), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000130.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter VII], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), page 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; These correspond to five ''[[Yamas]]'' of ancient Hindu ethics: [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Satya]] (truth, non-falsehood), [[Asteya]] (non-stealing), [[Brahmacharya]] (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and [[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness).&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Andrea Hornett (2012), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and Forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-642-32445-1}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-78&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as ''[[Niyamas]]'': ''[[Shaucha|Śauca]]'' (purity in body, speech and mind), ''Santosha'' (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (perseverance, meditation, austerity), ''Swadhyaya'' (lifelong learning) and ''Pranidhan'' (right attitude, contemplation).&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) ''Gunas'' that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) ''Purushartha'' that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness ([[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]]); (3) ''Ashramas'' that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) ''Varnasramas'' that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wfg&gt;William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes:&lt;ref name=agw/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept,&lt;ref name=wfg2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Fall, 2002), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, pages 87-96, 111-114, 131-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Reichenbach (1988), The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of ‘Just War’. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339-361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

==Islamic ethics==
{{Main|Islamic ethics}}{{See also|Halal|Haram}}
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as [[John Kelsay]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Ethics'' phrases, "ultimately points to the reality of God." Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]], or the sayings of Muhammad) {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;''Islamic ethics'', Encyclopedia of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "ignorance."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Macho|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility.  A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth.  Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster.  And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice.  Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.”  (Quran 31:18-19)

Muslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand.  Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations.  It is universal in its scope and in its applicability.  Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits.  Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue.  They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them.  In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:

“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him  who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”

==Jewish ethics==
{{Main|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the [[Oral Torah]] both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with [[ethics]] is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Mishnah|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'', popularly translated as ''Ethics of the Fathers''. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]], and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal ([[halakhic]]) portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature.  This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early [[Christian]] tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of [[IV Maccabees]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], and [[Philo]].

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the [[Wisdom literature]] shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view [[Ben Sira]]'s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from [[Hasidean]] circles in the [[Maccabean]] time, such as are contained in [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], especially in Chapter IV. Here the first [[ethical will]] or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the [[Golden Rule]], "Do that to no man which thou hatest!" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the [[Book of Enoch|Ethiopic Enoch]] (xciv. et seq.) and the [[Slavonic Enoch]] (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, [[idolatry]], [[murder]], and [[incest]], were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] these [[Noachide Laws]] were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]], including followers of both [[Asatru]] and [[Theodism]], try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples ([[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]]) through the form of the [[Nine Noble Virtues]].

==Scientology ethics==
{{Main|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology ethics is based upon the concepts of [[good and evil]]. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Morality without religion}} {{See also|Secular ethics}}
Secular ethics is a [[moral philosophy]] in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including [[consequentialism]], [[freethinking]], [[humanism]], [[secular humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]], among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of [[natural rights]] and [[social contract]]s, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianesque]] [[ethical intuitionism]] or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with [[Occam's razor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Approaches such as [[ethical egoism]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral skepticism]], and [[moral nihilism]] are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==
Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the "desirable and required order".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt; Shinto adherents are to "realize and carry out the will of the ''kami'' and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt;

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for "blessings of the ''kami''", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"/&gt;

==Wiccan ethics==
{{Main|Wiccan morality}}
Wiccan morality is largely based on the [[Wiccan Rede]]: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean "do no harm at all", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, Judy (1985) [http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm "Exegesis on the Rede"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QgCzLc0I?url=http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |date=2007-07-28 }} in ''[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]]'' vol. 5, Number 3 ([[Oimelc]] 1985). Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Threefold Return]], which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''High Magic's Aid'', London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in [[Doreen Valiente]]'s ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] &amp; [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]], ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; these being [[Gladness|mirth]], [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]], [[honour]], [[humility]], strength, [[beauty]], [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[compassion]]. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

{{Lead rewrite|reason=no definition|date=October 2018}}
The book "New Bottles for New Wine" by [[Julian Huxley]], 1957, contains a collection of his essays beginning with  "[[Transhumanism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Julian|authorlink=Julian Huxley|title=New Bottles for New Wine|url=http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|year=1957|publisher=[[Chatto &amp; Windus]]/ [[World Transhumanist Association]]|location=London|pages=13–17|chapter=Transhumanism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522082157/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|archivedate=2011-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with "'''Evolutionary Humanism'''".  In the latter essay, Huxley called for a new religion compatible with science.

'Evolutionary Humanism' is the English language name of a book by Dr [[Michael Schmidt-Salomon]] which suggests that [[evolutionary theory]] has implications for morality. Schmidt argues that the theory of evolution does not prescribe a particular set of moral values but it does require people to consider their moral principles free from religious beliefs. Belief in evolution should be combined with a modern humanist philosophy.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Another theory of 'Evolutionary Humanism' is being developed by self-styled philosopher, Roland Herrmann, which holds that human behaviors, emotions, morals, feelings, and thought processes can be traced backward along the human evolutionary tree, rising in earlier animals. The theory holds that these emotions and behaviors are present on a variety of levels in various other species of animals, not only in primates and cetaceans in which these behaviors are most obvious. By recognizing that other animals can be sentient and can have complex thought processes and relationships, a closer bond and stewardship of the planet is necessary. Mr. Herrmann’s earlier website on this subject, www.evolutionaryhumanism.org, was transferred and is no longer associated with his school of thought.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18968">'''Faith and rationality''' are two ideologies that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility. [[Rationality]] is based on [[reason]] or [[facts]]. [[Faith]] is belief in [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], [[revelation]], or [[authority]]. The word ''faith'' sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against [[reason]] or [[evidence]], or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.

Although the words ''faith'' and ''belief'' are sometimes erroneously conflated{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and used as synonyms, ''faith'' properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of ''belief,'' as defined above.

Broadly speaking, there are two categories of views regarding the relationship between faith and rationality:
#[[Rationalism]] holds that [[truth]] should be determined by [[reason]] and factual analysis, rather than faith, [[dogma]], tradition or religious teaching.
#[[Fideism]] holds that faith is necessary, and that beliefs may be held without any evidence or reason and even in conflict with evidence and reason.

The [[Catholic Church]] also has taught that true [[faith]] and correct [[reason]] can and must work together, and, viewed properly, can never be in conflict with one another, as both have their origin in God, as stated in the [[Papal encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]], ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' ("[On] Faith and Reason").

==Relationship between faith and reason==
From at least the days of the Greek Philosophers, the relationship between faith and reason has been hotly debated. [[Plato]] argued that knowledge is simply memory of the eternal. [[Aristotle]] set down rules by which knowledge could be discovered by reason.

Rationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs — irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce. Or, according to [[Pascal's Wager]], it may be to our advantage to have faith, because faith may promise infinite rewards, while the rewards of reason are seen by many as finite. One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by [[B. F. Skinner]] in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour.  The result was that each of pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.&lt;ref name=Skinner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title='Superstition' in the pigeon.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1948|volume=38|issue=2|pages=168–172|doi=10.1037/h0055873|pmid=18913665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in faith — for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone — frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 255| last = Rosental| first = Creighton J| title = The reconciliation of faith and reason in Thomas Aquinas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the universe is a sensible place and that our minds allow us to arrive at correct conclusions about it, is a belief we hold through faith. Rationalists contend that this is arrived at because they have observed the world being consistent and sensible, not because they have faith that it is.

Beliefs held "by faith" may be seen existing in a number of relationships to rationality:
* '''Faith as underlying rationality''': In this view, all human [[knowledge]] and reason is seen as dependent on [[faith]]: faith in our senses, faith in our [[reason]], faith in our [[Memory|memories]], and faith in the accounts of events we receive from others. Accordingly, faith is seen as essential to and inseparable from rationality. According to [[René Descartes]], rationality is built first upon the realization of the absolute truth "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]", which requires no faith. All other rationalizations are built outward from this realization, and are subject to [[Falsifiability|falsification]] at any time with the arrival of new evidence.
* '''Faith as addressing issues beyond the scope of rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as covering issues that science and rationality are inherently incapable of addressing, but that are nevertheless entirely real. Accordingly, faith is seen as complementing rationality, by providing answers to questions that would otherwise be unanswerable.
* '''Faith as contradicting rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as those views that one holds despite evidence and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith is seen as pernicious with respect to rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality is seen as the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.
* '''Faith and reason as essential together''': This is the Catholic view that faith without reason leads to [[superstition]], while [[reason]] without [[faith]] leads to [[nihilism]] and [[relativism]].
* '''Faith as based on warrant''': In this view some degree of evidence provides warrant for faith. "To explain great things by small."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawker|first=Robert|title=Poor Man's Commentary|year=1805|pages=Hebrews 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of the Roman Catholic Church==
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], the most important [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|doctor of the Catholic Church]], was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith—an intellectual assent&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm Faith]" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;—and reason,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm Reason]" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; predominately in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', ''[[De Veritate (Thomas Aquinas)|De Veritate]]'', and ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview—with copious quotes from [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s works, some of which are quoted here—of his exposition of the topic of faith and reason, consult [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323175836/http://www.truthinspire.com/reason-and-faith/ truthinspire.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Trent]]'s [[catechism]]—the ''[[Roman Catechism]]'', written during the Catholic Church's [[Counter-Reformation]] to combat [[Protestantism]] and [[Martin Luther]]'s antimetaphysical tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BeckerFaith.pdf Faith and Reason in Martin Luther]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the differences between [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s conception of faith and reason and that of [[Martin Luther]].{{cite journal |journal=''The Thomist'' |title=Faith and Reason Reconsidered: Aquinas and Luther on Deciding What is True |author=Bruce D. Marshall |year=1999 |volume=63 |pages=1–48 |url=http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/991aMars.htm |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031101170000/http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/991aMars.htm |archivedate=2003-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dei Filius]]'' was a [[dogmatic constitution]] of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the [[Roman Catholic]] faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870 and was influenced by the philosophical conceptions of [[Johann Baptist Franzelin]], who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html#v.ii.i-p21.5|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds.|work=ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Roman Catholic Church does not disparage reason, but rather affirms its veracity and utility, there have been many [[List of Roman Catholic cleric–scientists|Catholic scientists]] over the ages.

Twentieth-century [[Thomism|Thomist]] philosopher [[Étienne Gilson]] wrote about faith and reason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/|title="Faith and Reason" by Étienne Gilson|work=arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1922 book ''Le Thomisme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lethomismeintrod01gilsuoft|title=Le thomisme; introduction au système de saint Thomas d'Aquin|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary [[Jacques Maritain]] wrote about it in his ''The Degrees of Knowledge''.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/DegreesOfKnowledge&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' is an encyclical promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998. It deals with the relationship between faith and reason.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 12 September 2006 [[Regensburg Lecture]] was about faith and reason.

==Lutheran epistemology==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Some have asserted that [[Martin Luther]] taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.  Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each understand. Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work "Fides Und Ratio" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently [[Hans-Peter Großhans]] has demonstrated that Luther's work on Bibilical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible be reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible make sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than Reason which for Luther denoted science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a differing picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.

==Reformed epistemology==

===Faith as underlying rationality===
The view that faith underlies all rationality holds that rationality is dependent on faith for its coherence. Under this view, there is no way to comprehensively ''prove'' that we are actually seeing what we appear to be seeing, that what we remember actually happened, or that the laws of logic and mathematics are actually real. Instead, all beliefs depend for their coherence on ''faith'' in our senses, memory, and reason, because the foundations of rationalism cannot be proven by evidence or reason. Rationally, you can not prove anything you see is real, but you can prove that you yourself are real, and rationalist belief would be that you can believe that the world is consistent until something demonstrates inconsistency. This differs from faith based belief, where you believe that your world view is consistent no matter what inconsistencies the world has with your beliefs.

===Rationalist point of view===
In this view, there are many beliefs that are held by faith alone, that rational thought would force the mind to reject. As an example, many people believe in the Biblical story of Noah's flood: that the entire Earth was covered by water for forty days. But objected that most plants cannot survive being covered by water for that length of time, a boat of that magnitude could not have been built by wood, and there would be no way for two of every animal to survive on that ship and migrate back to their place of origin. (such as penguins), Although Christian apologists offer answers to these and such issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ham|first=Ken|title=Was There Really a Noah's Ark &amp; Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/really-a-flood-and-ark|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=David|title=How Did Plants Survive the Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/aid/v7/n1/how-did-plants-survive-flood|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How did animals get from the Ark to isolated places..|url=http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html|work=Christian Answers Network|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the premise that such responses are insufficient, then one must choose between accepting the story on faith and rejecting reason, or rejecting the story by reason and thus rejecting faith.

Within the rationalist point of view, there remains the possibility of multiple rational explanations.  For example, considering the biblical story of Noah's flood, one making rational determinations about the probability of the events does so via interpretation of modern evidence.  Two observers of the story may provide different plausible explanations for the life of plants, construction of the boat, species living at the time, and migration following the flood.  Some see this as meaning that a person is not strictly bound to choose between faith and reason.

==Evangelical views==
American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]]  stated that the Greek word ''pistis''  used for faith in the New Testament  (over two hundred forty times), and  rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Archibald Thomas|title=WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages=Chapter 17|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that  when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Thomas|title=Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url=http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to faith meaning  blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, [[Alister McGrath]] quotes  Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas, (1861-1924),  who states faith is "not blind, but intelligent"  and "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as  "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title=The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=140512556X|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alvin Plantinga]] upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this,  he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe.  "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Warranted Christian Belief|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0195131924|pages=250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish philosophy==
The 14th Century Jewish philosopher [[Levi ben Gerson]] tried to reconcile faith and reason.  He wrote, "The Torah cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, volume VIII, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  His contemporary [[Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas]] argued the contrary view, that reason is weak and faith strong, and that only through faith can we discover the fundamental truth that God is love, that through faith alone can we endure the suffering that is the common lot of God's chosen people.

In religion, a '''false prophet''' is one who falsely claims the gift of [[prophecy]] or [[Revelation|divine inspiration]], or who uses that gift for [[evil]] ends. Often, someone who is considered a "true [[prophet]]" by some people is simultaneously considered a "false prophet" by others, even within the same religion as the "prophet" in question. The term is sometimes applied outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory that the speaker thinks is false.

[[File:B Facundus 220v.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fate of The False Prophet'', [[Events of Revelation#Chapter 16|Revelation 16]], Beatus de Facundus, 1047]]

Throughout the [[New Testament]], there are warnings of both false prophets and [[false Messiah]]s, and believers are adjured to be vigilant. The following verses ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|7:15-20|RSV}}) are from the [[Sermon on the Mount]]:

:"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits."

The New Testament addresses the same point of a false prophet predicting correctly and Jesus predicted the future appearance of [[false Christ]]s and false prophets, affirming that they can perform great signs and miracles. The following verses are from the [[Olivet Discourse]]:

:"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ''I am the Christ'', and they will lead many astray. [...] Then if any one says to you, ''Lo, here is the Christ!'' or ''There he is!'', do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Lo, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ''Lo, he is in the wilderness'', do not go out; if they say, ''Lo, he is in the inner rooms'', do not believe it." (Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:4-5|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:23-26|RSV}})

In the [[Gospel of Luke]], Jesus brought out an ethical application for his disciples using the analogy of false prophets in the Old Testament:

:"Woe to you, when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets." ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:26|RSV}})

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] encountered a false prophet named [[Elymas|Elymas Bar-Jesus]] on the island of [[Cyprus]]:

:"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus. He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord." ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:6-12|RSV}})

This particular story likewise best matches the model found in [[Deuteronomy]]. The claim here is that Elymas is trying to turn [[Sergius Paulus]] from the true faith, just like the false prophet described in the preceding verses. In these verses, we do not see Elymas prophesying as the term is popularly understood, so the model seems to fit this scenario best.

The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] makes a comparison between false teachers and false prophets and how the former will bring in false teachings, just like the false prophets of old:

:"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from of old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep." ([[2 Peter]] {{Bibleverse-nb||2 Peter|2:1-3|RSV}})

The [[First Epistle of John]] warns those of the Christian faith to test every spirit because of these false prophets:

:"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already." ([[1 John]] {{Bibleverse-nb||1 John|4:1-3|RSV}})

===The false prophet of ''Revelation''===
One well-known New Testament false prophet is the false prophet mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. The Apocalypse's false prophet is the agent of the [[The beast (Revelation)#Beast from the sea|Beast]], the [[Antichrist]], and he is ultimately cast with the Beast into the [[Lake of Fire#Christianity|lake of "fire and brimstone"]] ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:20|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|20:10|RSV}}). Another mention of a false prophet in the New Testament is an [[Antichrist|antichrist spirit]] which denies the Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunny|first=Ahmad|date=19 Apr 2011|title=Prophet Muhammad in French and English Literature: 1650 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE0xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|location=|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|page=94|isbn=0860374785|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|editor-last=Tolan|editor-first=John Victor|date=15 September 2000|title=Medieval Christian Perceptions of Islam: A Book of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RAtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PG121|location=|publisher=Routledge|page=99|isbn=0415928923|author-link=John V.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic eschatology|List of Mahdi claimants|Prophets of Islam}}
The [[Quran]] portrays [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|Seal of the Prophets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is understood by mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Muslims to mean that anyone who claims to be a new prophet after him is a [[False messiah|false prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|128|e=129|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia denominations do not see the second coming of the [[Messiah]] as the coming of a new prophet, as the Islamic Messiah [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] had already been an existing prophet, and will rule by the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad]], bringing no new revelation or prophecy.

Thawban ibn Kaidad narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"There will be 30 dajjals among my Ummah. Each one will claim that he is a prophet; but I am the last of the Prophets (Seal of the Prophets), and there will be no Prophet after me."|Related by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"The Hour will not be established until two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, until about 30 dajjals appear, and each of them will claim that he is Allah's Apostle..."|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 9, Book 88: Afflictions and the End of the World, Hâdith Number 237.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|88|237}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Muhammad also stated that the last of these Dajjals would be the [[False Messiah]], [[Masih ad-Dajjal|al-Masih ad-Dajjal]] ([[Antichrist]]):

[[Samra ibn Jundab]] reported once Muhammad (while delivering a ceremonial speech at an occasion of a solar eclipse) said;
{{Quote|"Verily by Allah, the Last Hour will not come until 30 dajjals will appear and the final one will be the One-eyed False Messiah."|Related by [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmed]] and [[Al-Tabarani|Imam Tabarani]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Anas ibn Malik]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|1="There is never a prophet who has not warned the Ummah of that one-eyed liar; behold he is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed.&lt;ref name="muslim1"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dajjal is blind of one eye&lt;ref name="muslim2"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his forehead are the letters [[K-F-R|k. f. r.]] ([[Kafir]])&lt;ref name="muslim1"/&gt; between the eyes of the Dajjal&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which every Muslim would be able to read."&lt;ref name="muslim2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |title=The Signs Before the Day of Judgment by Ibn Kathîr |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315191536/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|2=[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 41: The Book Pertaining to the Turmoil and Portents of the Last Hour, Chapter 7: The Turmoil Would Go Like The Mounting Waves of the Ocean, Ahâdith 7007-7009.}}

[[Mahdi|Imam Mahdi]], the redeemer according to Islam, will appear on Earth before the Day of Judgment.&lt;ref name="Muslim World 2004 p.421"&gt;Martin 2004: 421&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;Glasse 2001: 280&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Second Coming of Christ#Islam|Second Coming of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|3|55|q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Prophet [[Jesus in Islam|'Isa]] ([[Jesus|Jesus Christ son of Mary]]) will kill al-Masih ad-Dajjal (The Antichrist).&lt;ref&gt;
{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7023}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslims believe that both Jesus and Mahdi will rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny, ensuring peace and tranquility.&lt;ref name="Momen"&gt;Momen 1985: 166-8&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder, and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place, and he says, 'Let us follow other gods' (gods you have not known) 'and let us worship them,' you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you" ([[Deuteronomy]] 13:1–5 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

The [[Books of Kings]] records a story where, under duress from [[Ahab]], the prophet [[Micaiah]] depicts God as requesting information from his heavenly counsel as to what he should do with a court of false prophets. This depiction is recorded in [[1 Kings]] 22:19–23:
: "Micaiah continued, 'Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.' And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"
: "One suggested this, and another that. Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, 'I will entice him.'"
: "'By what means?' the Lord asked."
: "'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said."
: "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'"
: "So now the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you" ([[1 Kings]] 22:19–23 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

It is possible that Micaiah meant to depict the false prophets as a test from YHWH. It is also possible that it was meant as a slur on Ahab's prophets, such as Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, 1 Kings: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible Commentaries, Yale 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty for false prophecy, including speaking in the name of a god other than YHWH or speaking presumptuously in YHWH's name, [[List of capital crimes in the bible|is capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, if a prophet makes a [[prophecy]] in the name of YHWH that does not come to pass, that is another sign that he is not commissioned of YHWH and that the people need not fear the false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:22|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Koine Greek]] term ''pseuoprophetes'' occurs in the [[Septuagint]] Jeremiah 6:13, 33:8,11 34:7, 36:1,8, Zechariah 13:2, Josephus' Antiquities 8-13-1,10-7-3, War of the Jews 6-5-2, and Philo Specific Laws 3:8. Classical pagan writers use the term ''pseudomantis''.

==Use outside religion==
The term ''false prophet'' is sometimes applied outside religion, to describe promoters of scientific, medical, or political theories which the author of the phrase thinks are false. [[Paul Offit]]'s 2008 book ''[[Autism's False Prophets]]'' applied the phrase to promoters of unproven theories and therapies such as the [[thiomersal controversy]] and [[chelation therapy]]. [[Ronald Bailey]]'s 1993 book ''Ecoscam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse'' applied the phrase to promoters of the [[global warming]] hypothesis; however, by 2005 Bailey had changed his mind, writing "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Reason |author= Bailey R |title= We're all global warmers now |date=2005-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Fragan''' was a [[5th-century]] [[Pre-Congregational Saint]] and [[Prince]] of [[Scotland]].
He is celebrated on 3 October in the Calendar of the Breton Saints,&lt;ref name="grandterrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandterrier.net/wiki/index.php?title=Mod%C3%A8le:Almanak_Octobre|title=Modèle:Almanak octobre|website=GrandTerrier|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares with Gwen a [[Feast day]] on July 5 in the Roman Calendar.

Fragan came from Great Britain, and was a Prince of Albany in Scotland. In the 5th century he left Scotland to evangelize [[Armorica]].

==Family==
He was the [[husband]] of [[Gwen Teirbron|Saint Gwenn]] and father of the [[twin]] [[saint]]s [[Jacut]]&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baring3 /&gt; and [[Saint Wethenoc|Guethenoc]],&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baring3 /&gt; of [[Guénolé]], and of [[Saint]] [[Creirwy]], [[Winwaloe]],&lt;ref&gt;William Hone, The every-day book and table-book; or, Everlasting calendar of popular amusements (William Hone,  1837) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yxH3Vm9FcsYC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=st+Fragan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P4JxrnFNtA&amp;sig=oX_139i-yp62ixC5yPXWmiunTZg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd6erizejWAhWCzbwKHabHCCMQ6AEIWDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20Fragan&amp;f=false  p281].&lt;/ref&gt; son of Prince Fragan (or Fracan) and Teirbron.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, Alban.

J. Clark, 1908).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He left [[Great Britain|Britain]] and moved to [[Ploufragan]] ([[Côtes-d'Armor]]) towards the end of the [[4th century]] or perhaps as late as 418 [[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancien nom parfois attribué au vent, en particulier au [[mistral (vent)|mistral]], mais ici au vent de [[noroît (vent)|noroît]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moine Clément, ''Vie de saint Gwennolé confesseur'', dite ''Vie brève'', vers 860&lt;/ref&gt; There he settled in the [[Sang River]] valley.

According to Jerome, many Jews were also sold into slavery, so many, indeed, that the price of Jewish slaves at the slave market in Hebron sank drastically to a level no greater than that for a horse. The economic structure of the country was largely destroyed. The entire spiritual and economic life of the Palestinian Jews moved to Galilee. Jerusalem was now turned into a Roman colony with the official name ''Colonia Aelia Capitolina'' (''Aelia'' after Hadrian's family name: P. Aelius Hadrianus; ''Capitolina'' after Jupiter Capitolinus). The Jews were forbidden on pain of death to set foot in the new Roman city. Aelia thus became a completely pagan city, no doubt with the corresponding public buildings and temples...We can...be certain that a statue of Hadrian was erected in the centre of Aelia, and this was tantamount in itself to a desecration of Jewish Jerusalem." p. 159.
* [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html Cassius Dio's ''Roman History: Epitome of Book LXIX'' para. 13–14]: "13 At first the Romans took no account of them. Soon, however, all Judaea had been stirred up, and the Jews everywhere were showing signs of disturbance, were gathering together, and giving evidence of great hostility to the Romans, partly by secret and partly by overt acts; 2 many outside nations, too, were joining them through eagerness for gain, and the whole earth, one might almost say, was being stirred up over the matter. Then, indeed, Hadrian sent against them his best generals. First of these was Julius Severus, who was dispatched from Britain, where he was governor, against the Jews. 3 Severus did not venture to attack his opponents in the open at any one point, in view of their numbers and their desperation, but by intercepting small groups, thanks to the number of his soldiers and his under-officers, and by depriving them of food and shutting them up, he was able, rather slowly, to be sure, but with comparatively little danger, to crush, exhaust and exterminate them. Very few of them in fact survived. Fifty of their most important outposts and nine hundred and eighty-five of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. Five hundred and eighty thousand men were slain in the various raids and battles, and the number of those that perished by famine, disease and fire was past finding out. 2 Thus nearly the whole of Judaea was made desolate, a result of which the people had had forewarning before the war. For the tomb of Solomon, which the Jews regard as an object of veneration, fell to pieces of itself and collapsed, and many wolves and hyenas rushed howling into their cities. 3 Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore Hadrian in writing to the senate did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors, 'If you and our children are in health, it is well; I and the legions are in health'" (para. 13–14).

Diaspora [galut] connoted deracination, legal disabilities, oppression, and an often painful adjustment to a hostland whose hospitality was unreliable and ephemeral. It also connoted the existence on foreign soil of an expatriate community that considered its presence to be transitory. Meanwhile, it developed a set of institutions, social patterns, and ethnonational and/or religious symbols that held it together. These included the language, religion, values, social norms, and narratives of the homeland. Gradually, this community adjusted to the hostland environment and became itself a center of cultural creation. All the while, however, it continued to cultivate the idea of return to the homeland."

Israel Studies 10 (1): pp. 3–4.] "...the Jewish nation, which from its very earliest days believed and claimed that it was the "chosen people," and hence unique. This attitude has further been buttressed by the equally traditional view, which is held not only by the Jews themselves, about the exceptional historical age of this diaspora, its singular traumatic experiences its singular ability to survive pogroms, exiles, and Holocaust, as well as its "special relations" with its ancient homeland, culminating in 1948 with the nation-state that the Jewish nation has established there... First, like many other members of established diasporas, the vast majority of Jews no longer regard themselves as being in ''Galut'' [exile] in their host countries.7 Perceptually, as well as actually, Jews permanently reside in host countries of their own free will, as a result of inertia, or as a result of problematic conditions prevailing in other hostlands, or in Israel. It means that the basic perception of many Jews about their existential situation in their hostlands has changed. Consequently, there is both a much greater self- and collective-legitimatization to refrain from making serious plans concerning "return" or actually "making Aliyah" [to emigrate, or "go up"] to Israel. This is one of the results of their wider, yet still rather problematic and sometimes painful acceptance by the societies and political systems in their host countries. It means that they, and to an extent their hosts, do not regard Jewish life within the framework of diasporic formations in these hostlands as something that they should be ashamed of, hide from others, or alter by returning to the old homeland" (p. 4).

This evidence supports the impression of total regional destruction following the war. Historical sources note the vast number of captives sold into slavery in Palestine and shipped abroad. ... The Judaean Jewish community never recovered from the Bar Kochba war. In its wake, Jews no longer formed the majority in Palestine, and the Jewish center moved to the Galilee. Jews were also subjected to a series of religious edicts promulgated by Hadrian that were designed to uproot the nationalistic elements with the Judaean Jewish community, these proclamations remained in effect until Hadrian's death in 138. An additional, more lasting punitive measure taken by the Romans involved expunging Judaea from the provincial name, changing it from Provincia Judaea to Provincia Syria Palestina.

== Name and etymology ==
{{main|Jew (word)}}
{{main list|List of Jewish ethnonyms}}
The English word "Jew" continues [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|Gyw, Iewe}}''. These terms derive from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|giu}}'', earlier ''{{lang|fro|juieu}}'', which through [[elision]] had dropped the letter "d" from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Iudaeus'', which, like the [[New Testament]] [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Ioudaios]]'', meant both "Jew" and "[[Judean]]" / "of [[Judea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Facts On File Inc., Infobase Publishing, 2009, p.336&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term was a loan from [[Middle Aramaic|Aramaic]] ''{{transl|arc|Y'hūdāi}}'', corresponding to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|יְהוּדִי}} {{transl|he|Yehudi}}, originally the term for a member of the [[tribe of Judah]] or the people of the [[kingdom of Judah]]. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the name of both the tribe and kingdom derive from [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]], the fourth son of [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;"Jew", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 29:35 and 49:8 connect the name "Judah" with the verb {{transl|he|yada}}, meaning "praise", but scholars generally agree that the name of both the patriarch and the kingdom instead have a geographic origin—possibly referring to the gorges and ravines of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament|editor1-first=G.

The Hebrew word for "Jew" is {{rtl-lang|he|יְהוּדִי}} {{transl|he|Yehudi}}, with the [[plural]] {{rtl-lang|he|יְהוּדִים}} {{transl|he|Yehudim}}.&lt;ref name=EJ253&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Grintz|first=Yehoshua M.|editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Jew|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=11|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=253|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Endonym]]s in other [[Jewish language]]s include the [[Ladino language|Ladino]] {{rtl-lang|lld|ג׳ודיו}} {{transl|lld|Djudio}} (plural {{rtl-lang|lld|ג׳ודיוס}}, {{transl|lld|Djudios}}) and the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] {{rtl-lang|yi|ייִד}} {{transl|yi|Yid}} (plural {{rtl-lang|yi|ייִדן}} {{transl|yi|Yidn}}).

The etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g., يَهُودِيّ ''yahūdī'' (sg.), ''al-yahūd'' (pl.), in [[Arabic]], "Jude" in [[German language|German]], "judeu" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], "Juif" (m.)/"Juive" (f.) in [[French language|French]], "jøde" in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], "judío/a" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "jood" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], "żyd" in [[Polish language|Polish]] etc., but derivations of the word "Hebrew" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., in [[Italian language|Italian]] (''Ebreo''), in [[Persian language|Persian]] ("Ebri/Ebrani" ({{lang-fa|عبری/عبرانی}})) and [[Russian language|Russian]] (''Еврей, Yevrey'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falk|first=Avner|authorlink=Avner Falk|title=A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews|year=1996|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, N.J.|isbn=0-8386-3660-8|page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word "Jude" is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈjuːdə|}}, the corresponding [[adjective]] "jüdisch" {{IPA-de|ˈjyːdɪʃ|}} (Jewish) is the origin of the word "Yiddish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|title=Yiddish|edition=11th|year=2004|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87779-809-5|page=1453|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', fourth edition (2000),
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun ''Jew'', in phrases such as ''Jew lawyer'' or ''Jew ethics'', is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts ''Jewish'' is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of ''Jew'' as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as ''There are now several Jews on the council'', which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like ''Jewish people'' or ''persons of Jewish background'' may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Jew |title=Jew |publisher=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805210424/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/jew |archivedate=August 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. These definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.&lt;ref name="Klein2016" /&gt; Another argument is that the rabbis changed the law of patrilineal descent to matrilineal descent due to the widespread rape of Jewish women by Roman soldiers.&lt;ref name="Schott2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]] in the Bible. He brings two likely explanations for the change in [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (''[[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|Kil'ayim]]''). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]], and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.&lt;ref name="J.D. Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaye J.D. Cohen|year=1999|title=The Beginnings of Jewishness|publisher=U. California Press|pages=305–06|isbn=0-585-24643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the [[Tannaim]] may have been influenced by [[Roman law]], which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, [[Mater semper certa est|offspring would follow the mother]].&lt;ref name="J.D. Cohen" /&gt; Rabbi Rivon Krygier follows a similar reasoning, arguing that Jewish descent had formerly passed through the patrineal descent and the law of matrilineal descent had its roots in the Roman legal system.&lt;ref name="Klein2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factual reconstruction for the origin of the Jews is a difficult and complex endeavor. It requires examining at least 3,000 years of ancient human history using documents in vast quantities and variety written in at least ten near Eastern languages. As archaeological discovery relies upon researchers and scholars from diverse disciplines, the goal is to interpret all of the factual data, focusing on the most consistent theory. The prehistory and ethnogenesis of the Jews are closely intertwined with archaeology, biology, and historical textual records, as well as religious literature and mythology. The ethnic stock to which Jews originally trace their ancestry was a confederation of Iron Age semitic-speaking tribes known as the [[Israelites]] that inhabited a part of [[Canaan]] during the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|tribal and monarchic periods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People |last=Ostrer |first=Harry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0195379617 |publication-date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Jews are named after and also descended from the southern Israelite [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann E.

According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] narrative, Jewish ancestry is traced back to the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical patriarchs]] such as [[Abraham]], his son [[Isaac]], Isaac's son [[Jacob]], and the Biblical matriarchs [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Leah]], and [[Rachel]], who lived in [[Canaan]]. The [[Twelve Tribes]] are described as descending from the twelve sons of Jacob. Jacob and his family migrated to [[Ancient Egypt]] after being invited to live with Jacob's son [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] by the [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]] himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] led by [[Moses]], after which the Israelites conquered Canaan under Moses' successor [[Joshua]], went through the period of the [[Biblical judges]] after the death of Joshua, then through the mediation of [[Samuel]] became subject to a king, [[Saul]], who was succeeded by [[David]] and then [[Solomon]], after whom the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] ended and was split into a separate [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and a [[Kingdom of Judah]]. The Kingdom of Judah is described as comprising the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], partially the [[Tribe of Levi]], and later adding remnants of other tribes who migrated there from the Kingdom of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/307146/Judah Judah: Hebrew Tribe, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broshi 2001 174"&gt;{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/?id=etTUEorS1zMC&amp;pg=PA174|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1-84127-201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Jews claim lineage from those tribes since the [[Ten Lost Tribes|ten northern tribes]] were lost following [[Assyrian captivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judah-Hebrew-tribe |title=Judah |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=1 April 2018}}|&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of cultic practices, gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite [[ethnic group]], setting them apart from other Canaanites.&lt;ref&gt;Tubb, 1998. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Smith in "The Early History of God: Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel" states "Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture, archaeological data now casts doubt on this view. The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000&amp;nbsp;BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period." (pp. 6–7).

Another factor that made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of [[Brit milah|circumcision]], a requirement that proselytizing [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Christianity quickly dropped]]. The [[Fiscus Judaicus]], a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude [[Christian]]s in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal.&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ib2suAQgXxDFZ5zLdag9DMTFCaDPkJrDwResH1I_J4I/edit |work=The Times Literary Supplement|title=Secta and natio|first=MARTIN|last= GOODMAN|publisher=Docs.google.com |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judaism}}
The Jewish [[ethnicity|people]] and the [[religion]] of [[Judaism]] are strongly interrelated. [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] typically have a status within the Jewish ''ethnos'' equal to those born into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |title=BBC Religions/Converting to Judaism: "A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew in every sense of the word, and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism." |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/spirituality/conversion/Are_Converts_Treated_as_Second_Class.shtml |title=Are Converts Treated as Second Class? |work=InterfaithFamily}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-golin/the-complicated-relations_b_842806.html |title=Paul Golin: The Complicated Relationship Between Intermarriage and Jewish Conversion |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]], a religious interpretation of the traditions and early history of the Jews, established the first of the [[Abrahamic religions]], which are now practiced by 54% of the world. [[Judaism]] guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a "way of life,"&lt;ref&gt;Neusner (1991) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, [[Jewish culture]], and [[Jewish identity]] rather difficult.

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the [[liturgical language]] of Judaism (termed ''lashon ha-kodesh'', "the holy tongue"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures ([[Tanakh]]) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries.

For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive [[dialect]]al forms or branches that became independent languages. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is the Judæo-German language developed by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated to [[Central Europe]]. [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who migrated to the [[Iberian peninsula]].

Within the world's [[Jewish population]] there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating [[Israelite]] population, and subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the [[Old World]], often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation. During the [[millennia]] of the [[Jewish diaspora]] the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[nature|natural]], and populational. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural expressions]] of each community, including [[Jewish languages|Jewish linguistic diversity]], culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of [[genetic admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the ''[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]]'' and the ''[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]''. Ashkenazim, or "Germanics" ([[Ashkenaz]] meaning "[[Germany]]" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] cultural and geographical origins, while Sephardim, or "[[Hispanics]]" ([[Sefarad]] meaning "[[Spain]]/[[Hispania]]" or "[[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their Spanish/Portuguese Jewish cultural and geographic origins. The more common term in [[Israel]] for many of those broadly called Sephardim, is ''[[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahim]]'' (lit. "Easterners", Mizrach being "East" in Hebrew), that is, in reference to the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews who are often, as a group, referred to collectively as ''Sephardim'' (together with Sephardim proper) for liturgical reasons, although Mizrahi Jewish groups and Sephardi Jews proper are ethnically distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller groups include, but are not restricted to, [[Jews in India|Indian Jews]] such as the [[Bene Israel]], [[Bnei Menashe]], [[Cochin Jews]], and [[Bene Ephraim]]; the [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniotes]] of Greece; the [[Italian rite Jews|Italian Jews]] ("Italkim" or "Bené Roma"); the [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]]; various [[Jews and Judaism in Africa|African Jews]], including most numerously the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]]; and [[History of the Jews in China|Chinese Jews]], most notably the [[Kaifeng Jews]], as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities.&lt;ref name=EJ571&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmelz|first=Usiel Oscar |author2=Sergio DellaPergola |editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Demography|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=5|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=571|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of [[North Africa]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]], and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are no closer related to each other than they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are sometimes termed ''Sephardi'' due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are [[Egyptian Jews]], [[Iraqi Jews]], [[Lebanese Jews]], [[Kurdish Jews]], [[Moroccan Jews]], [[Libyan Jews]], [[Syrian Jews]], [[Bukharian Jews]], [[Mountain Jews]], [[Georgian Jews]], [[Iranian Jews]], [[Afghan Jews]], and various others. The [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]] are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.&lt;ref name=EJ571 /&gt;

Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]). As a result of their [[emigration]] from [[Europe]], Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the [[New World]] continents, in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], and [[Brazil]]. In [[France]], the immigration of Jews from [[Algeria]] (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name=EJ572&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmelz|first=Usiel Oscar |author2=Sergio DellaPergola |editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Demography|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=5|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|pages=571–2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[Israel]] is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a [[melting pot]] independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in [[Canada]] (315,000), [[Argentina]] (180,000–300,000), and [[Brazil]] (196,000–600,000), and smaller populations in [[Mexico]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and several other countries (see [[History of the Jews in Latin America]]).&lt;ref name="JPPI2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Assessment|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|year=2007|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=15|format=PDF}}, based on {{cite book|title=Annual Assessment 2007|publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]]|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=10142|volume=106|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] study, about 470,000 people of Jewish heritage live in [[Latin America|Latin-America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/jews/ |title= Jews - Pew Research Center|website= Pew Research Center|access-date= March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world.

[[Western Europe]]'s largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in [[France]], home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African countries such as [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] (or their descendants).&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 410–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] has a Jewish community of 292,000. In [[East Europe|Eastern Europe]], the exact figures are difficult to establish. The number of Jews in Russia varies widely according to whether a source uses census data (which requires a person to choose a single nationality among choices that include "Russian" and "Jewish") or eligibility for immigration to Israel (which requires that a person have one or more Jewish grandparents). According to the latter criteria, the heads of the Russian Jewish community assert that up to 1.5 million Russians are eligible for [[aliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mskagency.ru/materials/2716461 |title=Исследование: Около 1,5 млн людей с еврейскими корнями проживают в России |trans-title=Study: About 1.5 Million People with Jewish Roots Live in Russia |date=20 October 2017 |publisher=Moscow Urban News Agency |accessdate=28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=57988 |title=В России проживает около миллиона иудеев |trans-title=In Russia, There Are About a Million Jews |date=26 February 2015 |publisher=[[Interfax]] |accessdate=28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population,&lt;ref&gt;Jewish community in Germany: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131204213637/http://www.zwst.org/cms/documents/178/de_DE/ZWST-Mitgliederstatistik-2012-web.pdf ''Mitgliederstatistik der jüdischen Gemeinden und Landesverbände in Deutschland für das Jahr 2012''], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former [[Soviet Union]] since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|pages=40–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of [[Israelis]] also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jg-berlin.org/en/service/israelis-in-berlin.html|title=Israelis in Berlin|publisher=Jewish Community of Berlin|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the [[Arab world]] (excluding Israel). Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled [[Maghreb]] region, 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]]. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Rebirth of the Middle East], Jerry M. Rosenberg, Hamilton Books, 2009, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and around 30,000 in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century, although the only substantial [[aliyah]] came from [[Yemen]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M.

The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in [[Iraq]], Yemen and [[Libya]], with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from [[Egypt]] occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. [[Lebanon]] was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of [[Iranian Jews]] peaked in the 1980s when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Outside [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], the [[Middle East]], and the rest of [[Asia]], there are significant Jewish populations in [[Australia]] (112,500) and [[Jewish population of South Africa|South Africa]] (70,000).&lt;ref name="JVIL2010" /&gt; There is also a 7,500-strong community in [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

==== Assimilation ====
{{main|Jewish assimilation|Interfaith marriage in Judaism}}
Since at least the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their [[Jewish identity]].&lt;ref name=Johnson171&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods,&lt;ref name=Johnson171 /&gt; with some Jewish communities, for example the [[Kaifeng Jews]] of [[China]], disappearing entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shavei.org/communities/kaifeng_jews/articles-kaifeng_jews/chinese-jews-reverence-for-ancestors/ |title=Chinese Jews: Reverence for Ancestors |last=Edinger |first=Bernard |date=15 December 2005 |publisher=Shavei Israel |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003094552/http://www.shavei.org/communities/kaifeng_jews/articles-kaifeng_jews/chinese-jews-reverence-for-ancestors/ |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see [[Haskalah]]) and the subsequent [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jewish populations]] of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, [[Secularism|secular society]]. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar (2003), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[Interfaith marriage|interreligious marriage]] vary widely: In the United States, it is just under 50%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJPS: Defining and Calculating Intermarriage |url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46252 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024158/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46252 |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, around 53%; in France; around 30%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akadem.org/medias/documents/Rapport-Erik-Cohen.pdf|title=Les juifs de France: La lente progression des mariages mixtes|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=November 2002|publisher=Akadem|language=French|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/communities/show/id/2|publisher=World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521082932/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/communities/show/id/2|archivedate=21 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour&amp;nbsp;– Mexico|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Mexico.html|accessdate=7 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that most countries in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==== War and persecution ====
{{further|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|Jewish military history}}
[[File:The Emperor sends Vespasian with an army to destroy the Jews (f. 177v) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman Emperor [[Nero]] sends [[Vespasian]] with an army to destroy the Jews, 69 CE.]]

The Jewish people and [[Judaism]] have experienced various [[persecution]]s throughout [[Jewish history]]. During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] the [[Roman Empire]] (in its later phases known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) repeatedly repressed the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]], first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan [[Roman era]] and later by officially establishing them as [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|second-class citizens]] during the Christian Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg (2007), pp. 131, 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 164–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James P. Carroll|James Carroll]], "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200&amp;nbsp;million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James. ''[[Constantine's Sword]]'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2001) {{ISBN|0-395-77927-8}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Western Europe]], further persecutions of Jews by Christians occurred, notably during the [[Crusades]]—when Jews all over Germany [[Rhineland massacres|were massacred]]—and a series of expulsions from the [[Edict of Expulsion|Kingdom of England]], Germany, France, and, in the [[Alhambra Decree|largest expulsion of all]], Spain and Portugal after the [[Reconquista]] (the Catholic Reconquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] were expelled.&lt;ref name="Johnson207-208" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson213plus" /&gt;

In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam and Judaism]] have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Bernard1020"&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Bernard1020" /&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), pp. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by [[Bernard Lewis]] as "most degrading"&lt;ref name=Lewis131 /&gt; was the requirement of [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], not found in the [[Quran]] or [[hadith]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.&lt;ref name=Lewis131&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 131; (1984), pp. 8, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 17–18, 94–95; Stillman (1979), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as [[mellah]]s beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, it has become commonplace for standard [[Anti-Zionism and antisemitism|antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti-Zionist]] publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish [[Refah Partisi]]."&lt;ref name=Lewis_MEQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/396/muslim-anti-semitism|title=Muslim Anti-Semitism|first=Bernard|last=Lewis|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|work=Middle East Quarterly|publisher=Middle East Forum|date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from [[Deportation|expulsion]] to outright [[genocide]]; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The [[history of antisemitism]] includes the [[First Crusade]] which resulted in the massacre of Jews;&lt;ref name="Johnson207-208"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (led by [[Tomás de Torquemada]]) and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], with their persecution and ''[[Auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' against the [[New Christians]] and [[Marrano]] Jews;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 226–29.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bohdan Chmielnicki]] [[Cossack]] massacres in [[Ukraine]];&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pogrom]]s backed by the Russian [[List of Russian rulers|Tsars]];&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, pp. 364–5"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 364–65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled.&lt;ref name="Johnson213plus"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 213, 229–31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Human Genetics]], 19.8% of the modern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry,&lt;ref name="Adams2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Susan M.|year=2008|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=83|issue=6|pages=725–36|issn=0002-9297|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.11.007|pmid=19061982|pmc=2668061}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the number of [[converso]]s may have been much higher than originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/world/europe/04iht-gene.4.18411385.html|title=DNA study shows 20 percent of Iberian population has Jewish ancestry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(08)00592-2|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|publisher=Cell.com|work=American Society of Human Genetics|date=December 2008|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the [[Land of Israel]], and many of the areas in which they have settled.

Many of these Jews settled in [[Eastern Europe]], especially Poland.&lt;ref name="Gartner 11-12"&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1492, the Spanish population of around 200,000 [[Sephardi]]c Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]], followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Jews fled mainly to the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Netherlands, and [[North Africa]], others migrating to [[Southern Europe]] and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Johnson229-231"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 229–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, France's policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of Jews (especially from Eastern and Central Europe).&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, p. 306"&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to the arrival of millions of Jews in the [[New World]]. Over two million Eastern European Jews arrived in the United States from 1880 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, pp. 364–365"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; the rise of modern [[antisemitism]],&lt;ref name="Gartner 2001, pp. 213–5"&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 213–5.&lt;/ref&gt; the Holocaust,&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 357–70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Arab nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt; all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent, until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel.&lt;ref name="Gartner431" /&gt;

In the latest phase of migrations, the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of Iran]] caused many [[Iranian Jews]] to flee Iran. Most found refuge in the US (particularly [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Long Island, New York]]) and Israel. Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Netzer|first=Amnon|editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Iran|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=10|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=13|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Soviet Union collapsed]], many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been [[refusenik]]s) were suddenly allowed to leave. This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dosick 2007, p. 340" /&gt;

==== Growth ====
[[File:A man prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|A man praying at the [[Western Wall]]]]
Israel is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through [[natural population growth]], although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi]] Jewish communities, whose members often shun [[birth control]] for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 400–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox and [[Conservative Judaism]] discourage [[proselytism]] to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle [[Reform Judaism]] favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2003), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a trend of Orthodox movements reaching out to secular Jews in order to give them a stronger [[Jewish identity]] so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the [[Baal teshuva movement]]) for secular Jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Danzger (2003), pp. 495–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is also a growing rate of conversion to [[Jews by Choice]] of [[gentiles]] who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange (2002), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jhākri''' ({{lang-ne|झाक्री}}) is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for [[shaman]]. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the [[Tamang people]] and the [[Magars]]; it is also used in the [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]], which border [[Nepal]].

Jhākri shamanism is practiced among numerous [[ethnic group]]s of Nepal and [[Northeast India]], including the [[Limbu people|Limbu]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Sunwar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Tamang people|Tamang]], [[Gurung people|Gurung]], [[Magars]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Khas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |pp=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of [[spirit possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some vernacular words for ''jhākri'' are ''phedangbo'' in the [[Limbu language]], ''maangpa'' or ''nakchyong'' in [[Khambu]], and ''boongthing'' in [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]].

Jhākris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mun (religion)|Mun]], and [[Bön]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neopaganism]] (also [[modern paganism]] or contemporary paganism) encompasses a wide range of religious groups and individuals. These may include old [[occult]] groups, those that follow a [[New Age]] approach, those that try to reconstruct old [[ethnic religion]]s, and followers of the pagan religion of [[Wicca]]. For organizations, the founding year is given in brackets.

== Witchcraft ==
{{main|Wicca|Contemporary witchcraft}}
{{see also|Category: Wiccan traditions}}
Wicca originated in 1940s Britain and became the mainstream of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] in the 1970s. There are two core traditions of Wicca which originated in Britain, Gardnerian and Alexandrian, which are sometimes referred to as British Traditional Wicca. From these two arose several other variant traditions. Wicca has also inspired a great number of other [[witchcraft]] traditions in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], most of which base their beliefs and practices on Wicca. Many movements are influenced by the [[Goddess movement|Movement of the Goddess]], and [[New Age]] and [[feminism|feminist]] worldviews.

'''Remarks:''' Ranked by mean estimate which is in brackets. Irreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular believer, and people having no formal religious adherence. It does not necessarily mean that members of this group don't belong to any religion. Some religions have harmonized with local cultures and can be seen as a cultural background rather than a formal religion. Additionally, the practice of officially associating a family or household with a religious institute while not formally practicing the affiliated religion is common in many countries. Thus, over half of this group is theistic and/or influenced by religious principles, but nonreligious/non-practicing and not true atheists or agnostics.&lt;ref name="adherents.com"/&gt; See ''[[Spiritual but not religious]]''.

===Taoists/Confucianists/Chinese traditional religionists===
As a spiritual practice, Taoism has made fewer inroads in the West than Buddhism and Hinduism. Despite the popularity of its great classics the I Ching and the Tao Te Ching, the specific practices of Taoism have not been promulgated in America with much success;&lt;ref&gt;Occhiogrosso, Peter. ''The Joy of Sects: A Spirited Guide to the World's Religious Traditions''. New York: Doubleday (1996); p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; these religions are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of bigger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. Nonetheless, Taoist ideas and symbols such as Taijitu have become popular throughout the world through Tai Chi Chuan, Qigong, and various martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/taoism/|title=BBC – Religion: Taoism|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh homeland is the [[Punjab(India)|Punjab]] state, in India, where today Sikhs make up approximately 61% of the population. This is the only place where Sikhs are in the majority. Sikhs have emigrated to countries all over the world – especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to an unusually high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity.
Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. But they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_sikh.html|title=Sikhs|website=Adherents.com|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christians==
; Bible beater: a [[dysphemism]] for Christian fundamentalists; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199888771|page=286|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a slang term for an evangelizing Christian fundamentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eble|first1=Connie|title=Slang &amp; sociability in-group language among college students|date=1996|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-1469610573|page=157|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=0mSJYH9KC-UC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[wikt:Bible thumper|Bible thumper]] (also "[[wikt:Bible basher|Bible basher]]"; mainly US): Someone perceived as aggressively imposing their [[Christian beliefs]] upon others. The term derives from preachers thumping their hands down on the [[Bible]], or thumping the Bible itself, to emphasize a point during a [[sermon]]. The term's target domain is broad and can often extend to anyone engaged in a public show of religion, fundamentalist or not. The term is most commonly used in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Robert E.|title=Ronald Reagan's Presidency: The Impact of an Alcoholic Parent|journal=Political Psychology|date=1 October 2008 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=737–765 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00662.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|date=February 2002
|quote=Yet a danger does still remain. It is the danger of "cafeteria Christianity," which lets people mix and match traditions any way they want, without discipline and without accountability. Unless we transcend cafeteria Christianity, our practices will be more [[sarabaite]] or [[Gyrovagues#Legacy|gyrovague]] than [[Benedictine]].}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news

| title =  Archbishop calls on Costa Ricans to abandon "cafeteria Christianity" and defend life
| location = San Jose | date = 29 March 2005 |quote= Archbishop Hugo Barrantes Urena of San Jose, Costa Rica, told Costa Ricans in his Easter message to embrace the faith without conditions or short-cuts and to defend the life of the unborn against efforts to legalize abortion. The archbishop warned that “based on a relativistic understanding of the Christian faith and a conditional adherence to the Church, some Catholics seek to construct a Christianity and, consequently, a Church to their own liking, unilateral and outside the identity and mission that Jesus Christ has fundamentally given us.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Fundie]]: (US) Shortening of [[fundamentalist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Material religion''' is a framework used by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] examining the interaction between [[religion]] and [[material culture]]. Its specific focus is on the place of objects, images, spaces, and buildings in religious communities.

Some scholars within the study of religion have criticised the material religion approach for often seeking to reintroduce the [[phenomenology of religion]] into the discipline.

==Definition==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history, is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world. It always has been and always will be. We can make sense out of the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion, because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human. We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.|source=— Scholar of religion S. Brent Plate, 2014{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=7}} }}

The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate was of the view that "religion must be understood as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices".{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=15}} He stated that "to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies."{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=8}}

==History==

The material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S. Brent Plate, David Morgan, etc.

In 2005, the peer-reviewed journal ''Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief'' was launched. In their editorial statement, the editors described it as "a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices."{{sfn|Editors|2005|p=5}}

==Criticism==
The anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] suggested that the term "material religion" was [[tautology (grammar)|tautological]], in that "religion is inherently material in its very constitution."{{sfn|Coleman|2009|p=360}}

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson suggested that the material religion framework could be an alternative means to explore religion, in contrast to the dominant [[world religions]] paradigm which they regarded as problematic.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|pp=12–13}} They nevertheless thought that material religion represented "phenomenology by stealth".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|p=13}}

'''Miao folk religion''' or '''Hmong folk religion''' is the common [[ethnic religion]] of [[Miao people]]s, primarily consisting in the practice of ''ua dab'' ([[Hmongic languages|Hmongic]]: "worship of deities").&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The religion is also called '''Hmongism''' by a [[Hmong Americans|Hmong American]] church established in 2012 to organise it among Hmong people in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="TH-Bylaws"&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/4d2fcd_f09e3033c247cb316b7c7a26a34183d4.pdf Bylaws of the Temple of Hmongism]. Hmongism.org: published March 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a [[pantheism|pantheist]] theology,&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 59"&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; centered on worship of [[deity|deities]] and [[progenitor]]s of the Miao peoples. Throughout its history it has incorporated theoretical and ritual elements from [[Taoism]],&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and broader [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], especially the emphasis on the pattern of the forces of the natural universe and the need of human life to be in accordance with these forces.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"/&gt;

Most Hmong continue to practice the traditional religion, although many Hmong in [[Asia]] have converted to [[Buddhism]] or have mixed it with Buddhism,&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"/&gt; and many Hmong Americans and Hmong Australians have adopted [[Christianity]] or Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
===Deities and world===
The highest god of Hmong traditional religion is called ''Saub'' or ''Yawm Saub'',&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; who endows the [[shaman]]s with their abilities. The Saub god may be called in times of need and he can manifest in points of crisis throughout the course of history.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"/&gt; The first shaman was ''Siv Yis'':&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Hmong shamans refer to themselves as "Siv Yis" when they are in [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]]. The gods of cosmic nature are simply called ''dab'', while ''dab neeb'' or ''qhua neeb'' are shamanic spirits that float through the worlds and work with the shamans operating within a specific sphere which is their domain.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The shamanic spirits include wild spirits of untamed nature and the tamed and friendly spirits of the house.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral spirits (''Xwm Kab'') who reside in the world of the dead form another category,&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; though also involved in shamanic practice.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt;

The frog god ''Nplooj Lwg'' is considered the creator of humans. ''Ntxwj Nyug'' and ''Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem'' are the lords of the otherworld, determining life, death and [[reincarnation]] or rest in heaven. While ''Ntxwj Nyug'' is an indigenous deity, ''Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem'' is thought to derive from the [[Jade Lord]] of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"/&gt; Every house has an altar for the ''Dab Xwm Kab'' (god of good fortune).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; ''Dab Pog'' is the goddess of babies.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; ''Zaj Laug'' is the "Old Dragon" or "[[Dragon King]]".&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; ''Poj Ntxoog'' is a fearful female spirit associated with the tiger.&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yaj Yuam'' is an ancestral [[hero]], the "Heavenly Archer", corresponding to the Chinese [[Houyi]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; Other gods are of nature, such as ''Xob'', the [[god of thunder]] and lightning, and ''Nkauj Hnub'' and ''Nraug Hlis'', "Lady Sun" and "Lord Moon".&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; [[Chi You|Chiyou]] (or Txiv Yawg) is worshipped as an ancestral god of the Hmong nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmongism.org/#!hmong-history/c1i2c Chinese Odyssey: Summer Program Offers Students Rare Opportunity to Learn Hmong History in China]. Hmongism.org, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hmong house is a reflection of the [[cosmos]]. It is constructed around a central post (''ncej tas'') representing the [[world tree]], axis of the spirits, which god is ''Dab Ncej Tas''.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The roofs represent the heaven (the spiritual world) and the floor symbolises nature (the world of men). The axis of the building represents the male head of the household and his ancestral spirit, the ancestral unity.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; Man is in the between of heaven and earth. The Hmong believe in various household spirits called ''dab nyeg'', meaning "tamed spirits", such as ''Dab Qhovcub'' (the god of the main hearth), ''Dab Qhovtxos'' (the god of the ritual hearth), ''Dab Nthab'' (the god of the loft), ''Dab Roog'' (the god of the framework of the front door).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; The ''Dab Txhiaj Meej'' is the god of wealth and richness.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; Spirits of nature are called ''dab qus'', "wild spirits".

===Yeeb and Yaj===
"Yeeb and Yaj"&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; is the Hmong equivalent of the [[yin and yang]] found in [[Chinese traditional religion]] and [[Taoism]]. Differently from the context of Chinese thought, the Hmong "yeeb and yaj" is not represented by symbols such as the ''[[taijitu]]''. The concept represents the world of the living and the world of the gods: ''yeeb ceeb'' is the spiritual world, while ''yaj ceeb'' is the world of material nature.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; The Hmong also practice ''looj mem'', the Chinese [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

==Structure and practices==

===The shaman===
[[Shaman]] practice is called ''ua neeb'' (ua: "to heal through the, ''neeb: the spirit world", the ''dab neeb'' being specifically shamanic gods),&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; while the shaman is called ''txiv neeb'', meaning "father of the ''neeb''".

The position of a shaman is not inherited as shamans are chosen by the ''neeb'' class of gods, manifesting through trails experienced by those chosen. Chosen people are guided by elder shamans until they are able to perform the healing rituals themselves. A shaman has control on his spirits helpers.

In the spirit journey, the shaman calls on his helpers who are spirits to guide or assist him in the spirit world. He moves and sing on a spiritual horse (''nees'') represented in the living world by a shaman's bench (''rooj neeb'').&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; He also calls on the forces of the [[cosmos]] to help him, such as the highest god ''Saub'', the First Couple, ''Pog Ntxoog'', Lady Sun and Lord Moon, the seven stars of the [[Pleiades]], and many animal spirits.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 25"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Divination horns (''kwam'') is one form or means of communication with the gods, and they are used in many rituals.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt;

The shamans perform two sessions of healing rituals: the diagnostic rituals (''ua neeb saib'') and subsequently the healing rituals (''ua neeb kho''), only if the patient shows no signs of recovery after the first ritual.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===House altar===
The Hmong household altar is dedicated primarily to the ''Dab Xwm Kab'' (god of good fortune).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; It is placed on the wall of the main room of the house.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; On the altar people make offerings of rice, chicken, soup and rice served in bamboo, with [[incense]] and joss paper.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; ''Txi dab'' is the general term for the sacrifice to the gods,&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; while ''laib dab'' is the ritual of sacrifice to the ancestors.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; On the last day of the Old Year rice is offered to the ancestors, with a sacrificed chicken, and a soul-calling (''hu plig'') ritual is held.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt;

The shaman's altar is a special hanging or standing altar, with two or three tiers depending on the status of the shaman.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to represent Siv Yis' grotto near the top of the holy mountain, above a pool near of which grows the flower of immortality.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt; This pool is represented by a bowl of water placed upon the altar.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt; From the altar depart several cotton threads resulting attached to the central housepost, and it is along these threads that the ''neeb'' travel when they visit the altar.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt;

A third type of Hmong altar is devoted to a special category of gods known as the ''dab tshuaj'', or gods of medicine, which are generally worshipped by women, since in Hmong culture they specialise in the knowledge of [[herbalism]].&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt;

[[Joss paper]]s are a central element of Hmong altars. There are both joss paper used as offerings and decorative joss papers. The second ones are used as [[symbol]]s connecting with the gods, and they are usually composed of large white sheets, with smaller yellow or silver sheets, and sometimes little red squares.

===Rituals and psychology===
Miao religious rituals involving the worship of gods and ancestors are performed by the patriarch of each family or the spiritual leader of a clan or a cluster of male relatives.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; More difficult ceremonies such as soul-calling (''hu plig'') are performed by ritual experts the [[shaman]] (''txiv neeb'') for spiritual healing, and various experts in funeral rites like the reed pipe player (''txiv qeej''), the soul chanter (''nkauj plig'') and the blessing singers (''txiv xaiv'').&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; The soul is believed to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; The body (''cev'') is a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] believed to be constructed by a number of souls (''plig'' or ''ntsuj'') that mirror the [[macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27"/&gt;

Hmong religion includes specific rituals for the milestones of the life cycle: there are rituals for birth and baby naming, marriage, rename after marriage, trauma and sickness, extending the mandate of life for sick elderly, death and funeral.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; There are also festivals with corresponding ceremonies: the New Year (''Lwm Qaib'' or ''Ntoo Xeeb'', or also ''Noj Peb Caug'') in mid-November, ''Nyuj Dab'' (Ox Festival), ''Dab Roog'' (Door Festival) and ''Npua Tai'' (Pig Festival).&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

A '''noaidi''' ({{lang-sme|noaidi}}, {{lang-smj|noajdde}}, {{lang-sma|nåejttie}}, {{lang-sms|nōjjd}}, {{lang-sjt|niojte}}, {{lang-sjd|noojd/nuojd}}) is a [[shaman]] of the [[Sami people]] in the Nordic countries representing an indigenous [[nature religion]]. Most ''noaidi'' practices died out during the 17th century, most likely because they resisted [[Christianisation]] and the king's [[authority]]. Their actions were referred to in courts as "[[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]" or "sorcery" (cf. [[witchcraft]]). Several Sámi shamanistic beliefs and practices were similar to those of some Siberian cultures.&lt;ref name=samsib&gt;Voigt 1966: 296&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
Noaidis, Sámi shamans, were traditionally the healers and protectors. Noaidis are said to have the role of mediator between humans and the spirits. To undertake this mediation, the noaidi communicated with the spirit world, asking what sacrifice needed to be made by a person so that they might return to good health, be successful in their hunt for food, and even for good weather. Sacrifices were designed by the noaidi to reestablish the balance between the mortal and immortal worlds. Using a traditional drum, which is the most important symbol and tool of the Sámi shaman, the noaide invoked assistance from benevolent spirits and conducted out-of-body travel via the “free soul” with the help of other siida members. The Sámi distinguish between the “free soul” versus the more mundane “body soul”; the “body soul” is unable to traverse the divide separating the spiritual netherworld from the more mundane, corporeal, real world.&lt;ref name="Holloway"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Decline of the Sámi People’s Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan “Ivvár”|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noaidi could engage in any kind of affair that demanded wisdom; it is said they took payments for their services. The activities included healing people, helping children, making decisions and protecting [[reindeer]], which represented the most important source of food and were also used as tribute payment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The sources from which we learn about noaidi are court protocols, tales, excavated tools (such as belts), and missionary reports. That noaidis were punished and in some cases sentenced to death for their "sorcery" should perhaps rather be interpreted as an attempt to obliterate opposition to the crown.{{cite needed|date=August 2013}} There was by law no freedom of religion during most of the 19th century and before, as the Lutheran Swedish church was the only allowed religion (except for some foreign temporary residents). Swedish priests supported conviction of noaidis for sorcery.

In the Sami shamanistic form of worship drumming and traditional chanting ([[joik]]ing) were of singular importance.&lt;ref name="Holloway"/&gt; Some of joiks were sung on shamanistic rites;&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).&lt;ref name=swap&gt;Voigt 1966: 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shamyoik"/&gt;

Recently, joiks have been sung in two different styles, one of which is sung only by young people. The other joik may be identified with the “mumbling” joik, resembling chants or magic spells.&lt;ref&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surprising characteristics of joiks can be explained by comparing the music [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, as observed in joiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. In some instances, joiks [[sound mimesis in various cultures|mimic natural sounds]]. This can be contrasted to other goals, namely [[overtone singing]] and [[bel canto]], both of which exploit human speech organs to achieve “superhuman” sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; Overtone singing and the [[imitation of sounds in shamanism]] are present in many other cultures as well.&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; Sound imitation may serve other purposes such as games and other entertainment&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as important practical purposes such as luring animals during hunts.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to religion:

'''[[Religion]]''' &amp;ndash; organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence. Many religions have narratives, symbols, and sacred histories that are intended to explain the meaning of life and/or to explain the origin of life or the Universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.

{{Zoroastrianism}}

A '''Parsi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|s|iː}}) or '''Parsee''' ("[[Persian people|Persian]]" in the [[Persian language]]) refers to a member of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community who migrated to India (mainly; including present day Pakistan) from [[Persia]] during the Arab invasion of 636–651 AD; one of two (the other being [[Irani (India)|Iranis]]) mainly located in [[India]], with a few in [[Pakistan]]. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', Parsis migrated from [[Greater Iran]] to [[Gujarat]], where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century AD to avoid [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].&lt;ref name="Hodivala 1920 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Hodivala|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boy148"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann205"&gt;{{harvnb|Lambton|1981|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns42"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan17&gt;{{harvnb|Khanbaghi|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1906|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|Widengren|1971|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the [[Sasanian Empire]]) was [[Zoroastrianism]]. Iranians rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Muslim-Conquest-Persia-I-Akram/dp/0954866533|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|last=Akram|first=A. I.|last2=al-Mehri|first2=A. B.|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Maktabah Publications|isbn=9780954866532}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time many Iranians (who are now called Parsis) chose to preserve their religious identity by fleeing from Persia to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/parsi-communities-i-early-history PARSI COMMUNITIES i. EARLY HISTORY – Encyclopaedia Iranica]. Iranicaonline.org (2008-07-20). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|fa|پارسیان}}, pronounced "Parsian", i.e., "Parsi" in the [[Persian language]], literally means ''Persian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138161 Parsee, n. and adj. - Oxford English Dictionary]. oed.com. Retrieved on 2015-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Farsi is the official language of modern [[Iran]], which was formerly known as Persia, and the [[Persian language]]'s [[endonym]] is ''Farsi'', an [[arabization]] of the word ''Parsi''.

The long presence of the Parsis in the [[India|Indian subcontinent]] distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=Kamala|date=2008|title=Intra-community Dissent and Dialogue: The Bombay Parsis and the Zoroastrian Diaspora|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23620804|journal=Sociological Bulletin|volume=57|issue=3|pages=315–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]]. The Parsis, whose name means "Persians", are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities near by in Karachi (Pakistan) and Bangalore (Karnataka, India). There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Hyderabad. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Chennai. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the [[Persian Gulf]], but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may in fact have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at [[Diu, India|Diu]] in [[Kathiawar]] but soon moved to south Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444672/Parsi Parsi (people) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Pārsi'', which in the Persian language is a [[demonym]] meaning "inhabitant of [[Fars Province|Pārs]]" and hence "ethnic Persian", is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms ''Zartoshti'' "Zoroastrian" or ''Vehdin'' "[of] the good religion". The 12th-century ''Sixteen [[Shloka]]s'', a [[Sanskrit]] text in praise of the Parsis,&lt;ref&gt;Parsi legend attributes it to a Hindu author; [[cf.]] {{Harvard citation no brackets|Paymaster|1954|p=8}} incorrectly attributes the text to a Zoroastrian priest&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.

[[File:Indian - Leaf from Bound Collection of 20 Miniatures Depicting Village Life - Walters 35176H.jpg|thumb|Parsis from India, c. 1870]]
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, [[Jordanus]], briefly refers to their presence in [[Thane]] and [[Bharuch]]. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician [[Garcia de Orta]] observed in 1563 that "there are merchants ... in the kingdom of [[Khambhat|Cambaia]] ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are [[Gentile|Gentios]]." In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see [[#Self-perceptions|self-perceptions]], below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that "Parsi" was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians.{{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}} {{Harvtxt|Boyce|2002|p=105}} notes that in much the same way as the word "Hindu" was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, "Parsi" was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term "Parsi" itself is "not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity" {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I. 373}}. Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as [[Parthia]]ns according to the ''Qissa-i Sanjan''. {{Harvard citation|Boyce|2002|p=105}}

The term "Parseeism" or "Parsiism" is attributed to [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], who in the 1750s, when the word "Zoroastrianism" had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the Parsi identity was well truly an identity even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Parsis is found in the Assyrian inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] (circa 854-824 BC).
* [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, “parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra”, meaning, “a Parsi, the son of a Parsi, an [[Aryan]], of Aryan family (Inscription at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]], near [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]).
* In Outlines of Parsi History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3-4 writes, “According to the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of [[Karnamak-i Ardeshir-i Papakan|Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan]], the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan ‘the king of the Parsis’.
* [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC referred to Iranians as Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani (1966) 68 Bom. L.R. 794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good ([[Ohrmazd]]) and evil ([[Angra Mainyu]]) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the ''[[asha]]'' or the righteousness and ''[[druj]]'' or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the [[Chinvat bridge]] to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the ''Avesta'', was written in the [[Avestan language]], which is closely related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

The ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a [[fire temple]].

=== As an ethnic community ===
[[Image:Parsi wedding portrait with Dastur MN Dhalla.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding portrait, 1948]]
Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of [[consanguinity]] or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. &lt;!-- religion, and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] --&gt;
[[Genealogical DNA test]]s to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention {{Harvard citation|Nanavutty|1970|p=13}} that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome]] (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of [[Pakistan]], it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours {{Harv |Qamar|Ayub|Mohyuddin|Helgason|2002| p=1119}}.

A 2004 study in which Parsi [[mitochondrial DNA]] (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] determined that Parsis (in Gujarat, but not in other parts of India) are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested "a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin" {{Harvard citation|Quintana-Murci|Chaix|Wells|Behar|2004|p=840}}. To put all the doubts to rest a deeper study was conducted in 2017 [https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9 “Like sugar in milk”: reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population] which confirms that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East.

=== Self-perceptions ===
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the [[navjote]] ceremony.

In this sense, ''Parsi'' is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]] in the West.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of [[gender equality]] and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

{{quote|the Parsi community consists of: a) Parsis who are descended from the original Persian emigrants and who are born of both Zoroastrian parents and who profess the Zoroastrian religion; b) Iranis [here meaning [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], not the other group of Indian Zoroastrians] professing the Zoroastrian religion; c) the children of Parsi fathers by alien mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit v. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhai|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] void the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. {{Harvard citation|Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar v. Merwan Rashid Yezdiar|1948}} On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an [[obiter dictum]] – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). ({{Harvnb|Merwan Rashid Yezdiar v. Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar|1950}}; {{Harvnb|Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani|1966}}).

Nonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.

According to the [[2011 Census of India]], there are 57,264 Parsis in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/where-we-belong-the-fight-of-parsi-women-in-interfaith-marriages-4900480/|title=Where we belong: The fight of Parsi women in interfaith marriages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Parsi-population-dips-by-22-per-cent-between-2001-2011-study/article14508859.ece|title=Parsi population dips by 22 per cent between 2001-2011: study}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Commission for Minorities]], there are a "variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community", the most significant of which were childlessness and migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=8, 21}}). Demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000.&lt;!-- Taraporevala|2000|p=9 --&gt; The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a '[[tribe]]'. &lt;!-- "cease to be termed a community and will be labelled {{sic}} a 'tribe'" --&gt;({{Harvnb|Taraporevala|2000|p=9}}).

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=21}}). A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest&lt;!-- infant mortality is the other possibility, but is negligible among Parsis--&gt;: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=14}}). Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02wmp5q|title=Saving India’s Parsis|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various factors that have led to the decline in Parsi community a few are listed below:

1.Late Marriage &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As most of the Parsi women, usually go abroad to seek higher education and are usually more qualified than Parsi men. They would like to stand up on their own- two feet and fetch for themselves. Causing them to get married late as a result of their work. 

2. Fertility Rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married late, the fertility rate decreases in women and their chances of conceiving decreases. 

3. Conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsi religion doesn't allow inter- caste marriage, only intra-caste. Hence, if a women gets married to a non- Parsi she is not sought to be a part of the community and is often discarded. She is not allowed to visit the fire temple, not allowed to attended her fathers funeral, do her childs Navjote Ceremony and is often neglected by her parents. 

4. Illnesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married in their own community since decades, the Parsi gene pool is rather weak and more prone to illness such as cancer, osteoporosis etc. Hence, they are more susceptible to illnesses and their death rates are higher than birth rates.  

&lt;br /&gt;

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high [[literacy rate]]; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in [[urban area]]s (the national average is 27.8%).

In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=18, 19}})

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian sub-continent ===
According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]], the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This historical region of [[Central Asia]] is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern [[Khorasan Province]], part of western/northern [[Afghanistan]], and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

According to the ''Qissa'', the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, [[Jadi Rana]], on the condition that they adopt the local language ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]) and that their women adopt local dress (the ''[[sari]]'').{{sfn|Hodivala|1920}} The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ([[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]], near [[Merv]], modern Turkmenistan).{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the ''alat''). In addition to these ''Khorasani''s or ''Kohistani''s "mountain folk", as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called,{{sfn|Vimadalal|1979|p=2}} at least one other group is said to have come overland from [[Sari, Iran]].{{sfn|Paymaster|1954}}

[[File:IslamicConquestsIroon.png|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and its surrounding regions on the eve of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]]]
Although the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the ''Qissa'', which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis".{{sfn|Taraporevala|2000}} Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the ''Qissa'' lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, "even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography."{{sfn|Kulke|1978|p=25}}

The Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Sindh]] touching [[Balochistan]], the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Even following the loss of [[Sindh]], the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The 9th-century Arab historiographer [[Al-Masudi]] briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I.374}} There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh.&lt;ref name="Hinnells2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHEc31SZStsC|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora:Religion and Migration: Religion and Migration|author=John R. Hinnells|date=28 April 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbours of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland [[Silk Road]] and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the [[Common Era]], and both the [[Puranas]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' use the term ''[[Parasika]]s'' to refer to the peoples west of the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}

"Parsi legends regarding their ancestors' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}{{sfn|Paymaster|1954|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Boyce|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Lambton|1981|p=205}} {{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}) However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the "traditional" 8th century date (as deduced from the ''Qissa'') is considered valid, it must be assumed "that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran [and] economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}} This would have been particularly the case if – as the ''Qissa'' suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on [[Silk Road]] trade {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}}. Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a [[chaplain]] with the [[British East India Company]], noted that the Parsis came to India seeking "[[liberty of conscience]]" but simultaneously arrived as "merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise." The fact that Muslims charged non-Muslims higher duties when trading from Muslim-held ports may be interpreted to be a form of religious persecution, but this being the only reason to migrate appears unlikely.

=== Early years ===
The ''Qissa'' has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the "Fire of Victory" (Middle Persian: ''[[Atash Bahram]]'') at Sanjan and its subsequent move to [[Navsari]]. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were "full of hardships" (''sic'') before Zoroastrianism "gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=447}}

Two centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to "difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction."{{Harvard citation|Kulke|1978|p=29}} These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five ''panthak''s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the ''Atash Bahram'' led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five ''panthak'' families.)

Inscriptions at the [[Kanheri Caves]] near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, [[Middle Persian]] was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the ''Qissa'' and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when "masterly"{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}} Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the [[Avesta]] and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that "religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period" and that the command of [[Middle Persian]] and Sanskrit among the clerics "was of a superior order".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}}.

From the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians "better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=457}}. These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the ''[[rivayat]]''s ([[epistle]]s) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these ''ithoter'' ("questions") are remarkably trivial – for instance, ''Rivayat'' 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying [[Avestan language]] texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of ''Juddin''s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|pp=474–475}}

Nonetheless, "the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former [[proselytizing]] zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=474}}. Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the [[social stratification]] that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the ''asronih'' in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the ''(r)atheshtarih'' (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), ''vastaryoshih'' (farmers and herdsmen), ''hutokshih'' (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the ''behdini'' ("followers of ''daena''", for which "good religion" is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century British colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the [[Indian caste system|Hindu caste system]] (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).

=== Age of opportunity ===
Following the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] and [[James I]] of England, the [[East India Company]] obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in [[Surat]] and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the [[Seven Islands of Bombay]] from [[Charles II of England]]. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.&lt;!--{{Harvnb|Hull|1913}}--&gt;{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=47–57}}

Where literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to "represent themselves as being like the British," which they did "more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community".{{sfn|Luhrmann|2002|p=861}} While the British saw the other Indians "as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful",{{sfn|Luhrmann|1994|p=333}} the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the colonial authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. [[Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo]] (1638) saw them as "diligent", "conscientious", and "skillful" in their [[mercantile]] pursuits. Similar observations would be made by [[James Mackintosh]], Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that "the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}

One of these was an enterprising agent named [[Rustom Maneck Seth|Rustom Maneck]]. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name "Seth" in the process), and in the following years "he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the [[Bombay Presidency]] were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now [[Bharuch]]), would note in his ''Oriental Memoirs'' (1770): "many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees." &lt;!-- [...] ---&gt; "Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company's subjects on the western shores of [[Hindustan]] where they are highly esteemed".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China.The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palsetia|first1=Jesse S.|title=The Parsis of India : preservation of identity in Bombay City|date=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9789004121140|pages=53–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=opium+parsi&amp;ots=cUcgUz8fym&amp;sig=MXhuA5W74fJHqoa9h67egxE9JRc#v=onepage&amp;q=opium%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually certain families "acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises."{{sfn|Hull|1913}}{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=37–45, 62-64, 128-140, 334-135}}).

Through his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so "established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant [[Maratha]]s, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 "fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay".{{sfn|White|1991|p=312}} Maneck's generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family "assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe".{{sfn|Ovington|1929|p=216}}

[[Image:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
In 1728 Rustom's eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the ''Bombay Parsi [[Panchayat]]'' (in the sense of an instrument for [[self-governance]] and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community.{{sfn|Karaka|1884|pp=215–217}} Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the ''[[The Times of India|Bombay Times]]'' noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the ''Bundobusts'' or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community.{{sfn|Dobbin|1970|pp=150–151}} In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized "Parsi Matrimonial Court". Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=223–225}}

At about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of [[structural cohesion|social cohesiveness]] that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=135–139}} Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]] founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary [[Maneckji Limji Hataria]] may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the [[jizya]] for their co-religionists in 1882.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as "the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity".{{sfn|Dhalla|1948|p=483}} By the close of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting 6% of the total population of the city (Census, 1881){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.

Nonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community&lt;!-- {Palsetia|2001}--&gt;. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into [[Parsi theatre]], literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, [[Scouting]] troops, clubs, and [[Masonic Lodge]]s. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], the first Asian to occupy a seat in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would note: "Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian".{{sfn|Ralhan|2002|p=1101}}

== Religious practices ==
The main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.

=== Purity and pollution ===
The balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.

=== [[Navjote]] ===
Zoroastrians are not initiated by [[infant baptism]]. Normally, a child is initiated into the faith when he or she is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, [[sedreh|sudre]], and [[Kushti|kusti]]. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is complete and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.

=== Marriage ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}{{main|Zoroastrian wedding}}
[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|Parsi wedding 1905.]]
Marriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.

=== Funerals ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

{{main|Dakhma}}
[[File:Parsee Tower of Silence, Bombay.jpg|thumb|Parsi Tower of Silence, Bombay.]]
The pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.

=== Temples ===
[[File:Parsi Fire Temple of Ahmedabad - Gujarat, India (4586854549).jpg|thumb|Parsi Fire Temple of [[Ahmedabad]], India]]
Zoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.

Until about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of [[Ardashir I of Persia|Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.

Sometime between 1125 and 1250 (''[[cf.]]'' {{Harvnb|Boyce|1970|p=537}}), the Parsis inserted an [[embolismic month]] to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, ''Shahenshahi'' (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.

In 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the ''Kadmi'' or ''Kadimi'' calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar as being "royalist".

In 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] model: the ''Fasili'', or ''Fasli'', calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year's day that fell on the day of the [[vernal equinox]]. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]'' 3.419){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- Should have matching reference in reference list for Denkard--&gt;.

Today the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar although the ''Kadmi'' calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The ''Fasli'' calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the ''Bastani'' calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the ''Fasli'' calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.

==== Effect of the calendar disputes ====
Since some of the [[Avesta]] prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is "correct" also has theological ramifications.

To further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the ''Kadmi'' calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the ''Kadmi'' calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of [[Avestan language]] and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the ''Kadmi''s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-''Kadmi'' Parsis.

The calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a ''Shahenshahi'' resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young ''Kadmi'' woman and so causing her to miscarry.

Of the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of [[fire temple]]) in India, three follow the ''Kadmi'' pronunciation and calendar, the other five are ''Shahenshahi''. The ''Fassali''s do not have their own Atash-Behram.

=== Ilm-e-Kshnoom ===
{{Main|Ilm-e-Kshnoom}}
The ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom'' ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (alternatively, in the [[Alborz]] range, around [[Mount Damavand]]).

There are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their ''Kusti'' prayers are very similar to those used by the ''Fassali''s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.

The largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (''Parsi Pukar''). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in [[Surat]], where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.

=== Issues relating to the deceased ===
[[File:St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth 17.JPG|thumb|Parsi funerary monument, [[St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth|St Mary’s Cemetery, Wandsworth]]]]
It has been traditional, in Mumbai and [[Karachi]] at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's [[vultures]]. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/16/rspb.2009.0071.full Cellular and humoral immunodepression in vultures feeding upon medicated livestock carrion]. Rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anti-inflammatory [[diclofenac]], both of which harm vultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peregrinefund.org/news-release/250 News Release]. The Peregrine Fund (2012-08-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue led to the [[Indian vulture crisis]], which led to the ban of the drug [[diclofenac]]. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the [[decomposition]] process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In [[Peshawar]] a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no [[Tower of Silence]]. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing off their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.

The Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]] is located at [[Malabar Hill]]. In [[Karachi]], the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the [[Chanesar Goth]] and [[Mahmudabad, Karachi|Mehmoodabad]] localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/386604/Tower-of-Silence Tower of Silence, Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and [[Y-chromosome]] DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis have a high frequency of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]] (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely even though they had a small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Lluís|last2=Chaix|first2=Raphaëlle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

A study published in ''[[Genome Biology]]'' based on high density [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian and Caucasus populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago. It is also found that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians who had recently received the genes from the Near East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Parsis have made considerable contributions to the history and development of India, all the more remarkable considering their small numbers. As the [[Maxim (literature)|maxim]] "Parsi, [[thy name is]] charity" [[allude]]s to, their most prominent contribution is their [[philanthropy]].

Although their people's name Parsi comes from the Persian-language word for a Persian person, in Sanskrit the term&lt;!-- need assistance: wordplay on -parSathas or paraseva? cf: CDSL ApR- --&gt; means "one who gives alms".&lt;ref name=jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212/&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi]] would note in a much misquoted statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsikhabar.net/news/can-zoroastrians-save-their-faith/2060/ Can Zoroastrians save their faith?].

In spiritual terminology, '''piety''' is a [[virtue]] that may include [[religion|religious devotion]], [[spirituality]], or a mixture of both. A common element in most conceptions of piety is [[humility]].

== Etymology ==
The word piety comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]'', the noun form of the adjective ''pius'' (which means "devout" or "dutiful"). 

==Classical interpretation==
''Pietas'' in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] virtue; a man with ''pietas'' respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin.&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''Nature of the Gods'', 1. 116 and ''On Rhetorical Invention'', 2. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. [[Aeneas]]'s consistent epithet in [[Virgil]] and other Latin authors is ''pius'', a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness. At the fall of Troy, Aeneas carries to safety his father, the lame [[Anchises]], and the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods.

In addressing whether children have an obligation to provide support for their parents, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] quotes, [[Cicero]], "..."piety gives both duty and homage": "duty" referring to service, and "homage" to reverence or honor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3101.htm Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', "Question 101. Piety", Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filial piety]] is central to Confucian [[role ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a virtue==
In [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Anglicanism]], piety is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. "It engenders in the soul a filial respect for God, a generous love toward him, and an affectionate obedience that wants to do what he commands because it loves the one who commands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33735 "Gift of Piety", Catholic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Piety belongs to the virtue of Religion, which the concordant judgment of theologians put among the moral virtues, as a part of the [[Cardinal virtues|cardinal virtue]] Justice, since by it one tenders to God what is due to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm  Delany, Joseph. "Virtue of Religion." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] described piety as recognizing “our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments” in life.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/06/04/piety-is-embracing-god-others-with-real-love-not-fake-devotion/ Glatz, Carol.  ''Catholic Herald'', 4 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Playing God''' refers to someone supposedly taking on the role of [[God]] for other purposes, also referred to as [[apotheosis]]. Alleged acts of playing God may include, for example, deciding who is to live or die in a situation where not everyone can be saved. Usually the expression is used to invoke a [[precautionary principle]] or to suggest that someone should refrain from a [[controversy|controversial]] action.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Philip Ball]] wrote an article saying that "playing God" is a meaningless and dangerous cliché,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/05/playing-god-is-a-meaningless-dangerous-cliche/ |title= "Playing God" is a meaningless, dangerous cliché |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher= |author=Philip Ball |date= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that it has no basis in [[theology]]. Instead it was adopted by [[theocon]]s from the 1931 film version of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', and has been used by journalists to refer to things with which they do not agree. The idea is further discussed in Practical Ethics, a blog linked to Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Practical Ethics - Blog |date= May 26, 2010 |url= http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2010/05/is-playing-god-just-a-meaningless-phrase |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120203191701/http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2010/05/is-playing-god-just-a-meaningless-phrase |dead-url= yes |archivedate= February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Korea}}

'''Religion in Korea''' refers the various religious traditions practiced on the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. The oldest indigenous religion of [[Korea]] is [[Korean shamanism]], which has been passed down from prehistory to the present.{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=41}} [[Buddhism]] was introduced to Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era in the 4th century, and the religion flourished until the [[Joseon]] Dynasty, when [[Korean Confucianism]] became the state religion.{{sfnp|Encyclopaedia Britannica|2008|p=162}} During the Late Joseon Dynasty, in the 19th century, [[Christianity]] began to gain a foothold in Korea.{{sfnp|Kim|2012}} While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century,{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=xv}} only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Sense of the Secular: Critical Perspectives from Europe to Asia|last=Baker|first=Don|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1136277214|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Ranjan|location=|pages=182–193|chapter=Korea's Path of Secularisation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v7ipRmW6M0C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=page182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[division of Korea]] into two sovereign states in 1945—[[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]—religious life in the two countries has diverged, shaped by different political structures.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Religion in Ancient Rome''' includes the ancestral [[ethnic religion]] of the [[city of Rome]] that the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] used to define themselves as a people, as well as the religious practices of peoples brought under Roman rule, in so far as they became widely followed in Rome and Italy. The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining [[pax deorum|good relations with the gods]]. The Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early [[Christian polemic]]ists.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the representation of Roman religion in early Christian authors, see R.P.C. Hanson, "The Christian Attitue to Pagan Religions up to the Time of Constantine the Great" and Carlos A. Contreras, "Christian Views of Paganism" in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.23.1 (1980) 871–1022.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and [[Roman art]], as the Etruscans had. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of [[augury]]. According to [[legend]]s, most of Rome's religious institutions could be traced to its [[founding of Rome|founders]], particularly [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Sabine]] second [[king of Rome]], who negotiated directly with [[Ancient Roman gods|the gods]]. This archaic religion was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', "the way of the ancestors" or simply "tradition", viewed as central to Roman identity.
[[File:Cybele Getty Villa 57.AA.19.jpg|thumb|Cybele enthroned, with [[lion]], [[cornucopia]] and [[Mural crown]]. Roman marble, c. 50 AD. [[Getty Museum]]]]

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', "I give that you might give". Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although [[Latin literature]] preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as [[Cicero]], who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order.  As the [[Roman Empire]] expanded, migrants to the capital brought their local cults, many of which became popular among Italians.  Christianity was in the end the most successful of these, and in 380 became the official state religion.

For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]], who tended [[Sacred_fire_of_Vesta|Rome's sacred hearth]] for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.

== Overview ==
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the [[Social class in ancient Rome|elite classes]]. There was no principle analogous to [[separation of church and state]] in ancient Rome. During the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC), the same men who were [[Roman Magistrates|elected public officials]] might also serve as [[augur]]s and [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]]. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. [[Julius Caesar]] became [[pontifex maximus]] before he was elected [[Roman consul|consul]].

The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman [[expansionism]] as a matter of divine destiny. The [[Roman triumph]] was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], who embodied just rule. As a result of the [[Punic Wars]] (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new [[Roman temple|temples]] were built by magistrates in [[votum|fulfillment of a vow]] to a deity for assuring their military success.

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the [[Mediterranean]] world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them,&lt;ref&gt;"This mentality," notes John T. Koch, "lay at the core of the genius of cultural assimilation which made the Roman Empire possible"; entry on "Interpretatio romana" in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome", p. 4; Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; W.H.C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 261. See, for instance, the altar dedicated by a Roman citizen and depicting a sacrifice conducted in the Roman manner for the Germanic goddess [[Vagdavercustis]] in the 2nd century CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the height of the Empire, numerous [[interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]], among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Epona]], and gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]].  Foreign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. Imported [[mystery religions]], which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of "[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]", conspiratorial (''coniuratio''), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[monotheism|monotheistic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State", ''Classical Philology'' 81.4 (1986) 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt; The monotheistic rigor of [[Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

In the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new [[Roman emperor|regime of the emperors]]. [[Augustus]], the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. [[Votum#Public vota|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the well-being of the emperor. So-called "emperor worship" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with [[Early Christianity|Christianity]], which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]''. Ultimately, Roman polytheism was brought to an end with the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire.

== Founding myths and divine destiny ==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Relief]] panel from an altar to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] depicting Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf, and gods representing Roman topography such as the [[Tiber]] and [[Palatine Hill]]]]
{{See also|Roman mythology|Founding of Rome}}
The [[Roman mythology|Roman mythological tradition]] is particularly rich in historical myths, or [[legend]]s, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. For Rome's earliest period, history and myth are difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Grandazzi]], ''The Foundation of Rome: Myth and History'' (Cornell University Press, 1997), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to mythology, Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the [[Trojan War|Trojan]] refugee [[Aeneas]], son of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] from Troy to Italy. These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]], Rome's female priesthood. Aeneas, according to classical authors, had been given refuge by King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], a Greek exile from [[Arcadia]], to whom were attributed other religious foundations: he established the ''[[Ara Maxima]]'', "Greatest Altar", to [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]] at the site that would become the [[Forum Boarium]], and, so the legend went, he was the first to celebrate the [[Lupercalia]], an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 1; 189 – 90 (Aeneas and Vesta): 123 – 45 (Aeneas and Venus as Julian ancestors). See also Vergil,'' ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy (the [[Latin kings of Alba Longa]]) with the well-known legend of Rome's founding by [[Romulus and Remus]]. The most common version of the twins' story displays several aspects of hero myth. Their mother, [[Rhea Silvia]], had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father. Through divine intervention, the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. She gave birth to twins, who were duly [[child exposure|exposed]] by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events.

Romulus and Remus regained their grandfather's throne and set out to build a new city, consulting with the gods through [[augury]], a characteristic religious institution of Rome that is portrayed as existing from earliest times. The brothers quarrel while building the city walls, and Romulus kills Remus, an act that is sometimes seen as sacrificial. Fratricide thus became an integral part of Rome's founding myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romulus was credited with several religious institutions. He founded the [[Consualia]] festival, inviting the neighbouring [[Sabines]] to participate; the ensuing [[rape of the Sabine women]] by Romulus's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome's myth of origins. As a successful general, Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome's first temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)#Epithets of Jupiter|Jupiter Feretrius]] and offered the ''[[spolia opima]]'', the prime spoils taken in war, in the celebration of the first [[Roman triumph]]. Spared a mortal's death, Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified.&lt;ref&gt;Or else was murdered by his resentful senate, who successfully concealed their crime. See Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 1; Vol. 2, 4.8a for Livy, 1.9 &amp; 5 – 7 (Sabines and temple to Jupiter) and Plutarch, ''Romulus'', 11, 1 – 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneis 3 147.jpeg|thumb|left|Aeneas urged by the Penates to continue his journey to found Rome (4th century AD illustration)&lt;ref&gt;Illustration of Vergil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.147; MS Vat. lat. 3225, folio 28 recto&lt;/ref&gt;]]
His Sabine successor [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] was pious and peaceable, and credited with numerous political and religious foundations, including the first [[Roman calendar]]; the priesthoods of the [[Salii]], [[Flamen|flamines]], and Vestals; the cults of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Mars, and [[Quirinus]]; and the Temple of [[Janus]], whose doors stayed open in times of war but in Numa's time remained closed. After Numa's death, the doors to the Temple of Janus were supposed to have remained open until the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 1 – 2 &amp; Vol. 2: 1.2, (Livy, 1.19.6): 8.4a (Plutarch, Numa, 10). For Augustus' closure of Janus's temple doors, see Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae]]'', 13. Festus connects Numa to the triumphal ''[[spolia opima]]'' and Jupiter Feretrius.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Rome's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic. [[Tullus Hostilius]] and [[Ancus Marcius]] instituted the [[fetial]] priests. The first "outsider" Etruscan king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], founded a [[Capitoline Triad|Capitoline temple to the triad]] Jupiter, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world. The benevolent, divinely fathered [[Servius Tullius]] established the [[Latin League]], its [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] Temple to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and the [[Compitalia]] to mark his social reforms. Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant [[Tarquinius Superbus]], whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected [[Roman magistrates|magistrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 3, and footnotes 4 &amp; 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman historiography|Roman historians]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] places Rome's foundation more than 600 years before his own time. His near contemporary [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] appear to share some common sources, including an earlier history by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]], of which only a terse summary survives. See also [[Diocles of Peparethus]], [[Romulus and Remus]] and Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives, Life of Romulus'', 3. Loeb edn. available at Thayer's site: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html]. Fragments of an important earlier work (now lost) of [[Quintus Ennius]] are cited by various later Roman authors. On the chronological problems of the kings' list, see Cornell, pp. 21–26, and 199–122.&lt;/ref&gt; regarded the essentials of Republican religion as complete by the end of Numa's reign, and confirmed as right and lawful by the [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]]: the sacred [[Topography of ancient Rome|topography of the city]], its monuments and temples, the histories of Rome's [[gens|leading families]], and oral and ritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 8-10; Cornell, pp. 1–30; Feeney, in Rüpke (ed), 129 – 42, on religious themes in Roman Historiography and epic; Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 31 – 42 for broad discussion of sources, modern schools of thought and divergent interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, the Romans considered themselves the most religious of all peoples, and their rise to dominance was proof they received divine favor in return.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''On the Responses of the Haruspices'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman deities ==
{{See also|List of Roman deities}}
[[File:Altar twelve gods Louvre Ma666.jpg|thumb|Twelve principal deities ''([[Di Consentes]])'' corresponding to those honored at the [[lectisternium]] of 217 BC, represented on a 1st-century altar from [[Gabii]] that is rimmed by the [[zodiac]]]]
Rome offers no native [[creation myth]], and little [[mythography]] to explain the character of its deities, their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world, but Roman theology acknowledged that ''di immortales'' (immortal gods) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth. There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults. At different times and in different places, the sphere of influence, character and functions of a divine being could expand, overlap with those of others, and be redefined as Roman. Change was embedded within existing traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed) 4 and Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 10 – 43; in particular, 30 – 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions of a semi-official, structured [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] were developed during the political, social and religious instability of the Late Republican era. [[Jupiter (mythology)#Cult|Jupiter]], the most powerful of all gods and "the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested", consistently personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared [[Capitoline Triad|his temple]], some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], who were later replaced by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;The reasons for this change remain unclear, though they are attributed to Etruscan influence. For a summary of Jupiter's complex development from the Regal to Republican eras, see Beard ''et al.,'', Vol. 1, 59 – 60. Jupiter's image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours. Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus were collectively and individually associated with Rome's agricultural economy, social organisation and success in war.&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual tendency toward [[Triadic deities|triads]] may be indicated by the later agricultural or [[plebs|plebeian]] triad of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]], and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 134 – 5, 64 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled, or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure. These later Roman [[pantheism|pantheistic]] hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and often Greek in origin. The [[Hellenization]] of Latin literature and [[Culture of ancient Rome|culture]] supplied literary and artistic models for [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreting]] Roman deities in light of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Olympians]], and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58. For related conceptual and interpretive difficulties offered by Roman deities and their cults, see Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed) 1 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tellus - Ara Pacis.jpg|left|upright=1.25|thumb|Three goddesses on a panel of the Augustan [[Ara Pacis]], consecrated in 9 BC; the iconography is open to multiple interpretations]]

The impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual's domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Rome's various [[Vicus (Rome)|neighborhoods]] and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 4 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this spirit, a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from [[Bordeaux]] to Italy to consult the [[Tiburtine Sibyl|Sibyl at Tibur]] did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I wander, never ceasing to pass through the whole world, but I am first and foremost a faithful worshiper of [[Onuava]]. I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava's favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.''&lt;ref&gt;CIL 13.581, quotation from Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Greco-Roman Mystery Cults ==
Throughout the life of Rome, a numerous array of "mystery cults" appeared. These cults were generally founded upon legends or sacred stories, such as the tale of Orpheus. Several had a basis in other cultures, such as the Cult of Isis, and Egyptian goddess. The members generally knew the stories were pure legend, but they provided a model for their followers to obey. These cults had often expensive, long, or trying initiation processes, which differed between cults, but prospective members were promised with a path to a better atmosphere and an atmosphere that fostered social bonds, known as ''mystai''. These bonds were generated due to the fact that most of these cults regularly practiced common meals among members, dances, ceremonies and rituals, and the aforementioned initiations. The focus of the cult, such as the focus on Orpheus among Orphic cults, did not necessarily dictate the theology of its members. The legendary tales were meant to guide members, but the deities involved tended to be a lesser focus. Mystery cults were present and generally accepted throughout much of Rome and provided a unique theological experience for their members. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/myst/hd_myst.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/mystery-religion&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holidays and festivals ==
{{See also|Roman festivals|Fasti|Roman calendar|Ludi|Roman triumph}}
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals. Some lasted several days, others a single day or less: sacred days (''dies [[fasti]]'') outnumbered "non-sacred" days (''dies [[nefasti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., 6 – 7; those titled in capital letters on Roman calendars were probably more important and ancient than those titled in small letters: it is not known how ancient they were, nor to whom they were important. Their attribution to Numa or Romulus is doubtful. The oldest surviving religious calendars date to the late Republic; the most detailed are Augustan and later. Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 6: a selection of festivals is given in Vol. 2, 3.1 – 3. For a list of Fasti, with bibliography and sources, see Degrassi, ''Inscriptiones Italiae, Vol. XIII – Fasti et elogia, fasc. II – Fasti anni Numani et Iuliani,'' Rome, 1963. See also Scullard, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions. Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ''[[ludi]]'' ("games", such as [[chariot races]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical performances]]), with examples including those held at [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia]] during [[Compitalia]], and the [[Ludi Romani]] in honour of [[Liber]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol. 1, 134 – 5, 64 – 67: citing Cicero.&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes,&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular groups, such as women at the [[Bona Dea]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 47 – 49, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Compitalia fresco.jpg|right|300px|thumb|This [[fresco]] from outside [[Pompeii]] shows Roman men celebrating a religious festival, probably the [[Compitalia]]]]
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The [[Roman triumph|triumph]] of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of [[votum|religious vows]], though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ''ludi'' attendant on a triumph were expanded to include [[Gladiator#Origins|gladiator]] contests. Under the [[Principate]], all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican [[Secular Games]] to mark a new era (''saeculum''), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in [[late antiquity]] is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation – a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, [[Ovid]]. In his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman [[antiquarian]] lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous;&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 2, 6.4a; Vol. 1, 174 – 6 &amp; 207 – 8.&lt;/ref&gt; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a ''[[vates]]'' or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the [[Saturnalia]], [[Consualia]], and feast of [[Anna Perenna]] on the [[Ides of March]], where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), ''passim''; "Transgressive Acts: Ovid's Treatment of the Ides of March", ''Classical Philology'' 91.4 (1996) 320-338.&lt;/ref&gt; But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (AD 354), cited in Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 250, and that of [[Polemius Silvius]]. See also early and later Christian festivals in Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 378 – 80, 382 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temples and shrines ==
[[File:Sanlorenzoinmiranda-rome.jpg|thumb|Portico of the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]], later incorporated into a church]]
{{Main|Roman temple}}
Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors, and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|Sacrifices]], chiefly [[animal sacrifice|of animals]], would take place at an open-air [[altar]] within the ''templum'' or precinct, often to the side of the steps leading up to the raised portico.  The main room ''(cella)'' inside a temple housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a small altar for incense or [[libation]]s. It might also display art works looted in war and rededicated to the gods.  It is not clear how accessible the interiors of temples were to the general public.

The Latin word ''[[:wikt:templum|templum]]'' originally referred not to the temple building itself, but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury: "The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 1, citing Frank E. Brown, ''Roman Architecture'', (New York) 1961, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] always uses the word ''templum'' to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common Latin words ''[[:wikt:aedes|aedes]]'', ''[[:wikt:delubrum|delubrum]]'', or ''[[:wikt:fanum|fanum]]'' for a temple or shrine as a building. The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture.

Temple buildings and shrines within the city commemorated significant political settlements in its development: the Aventine Temple of Diana supposedly marked the founding of the Latin League under Servius Tullius.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, et al., Vol. 1, 321 – 3&lt;/ref&gt; Many temples in the Republican era were built as the fulfillment of a [[votum|vow]] made by a general in exchange for a victory.

== Religious practice ==

=== Prayers, vows, and oaths ===
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective. [[Pliny the Elder]] declared that "a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 28.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer by itself, however, had independent power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 235–236 ''et passim''. The Roman belief in the power of the word may be reflected also in the importance of persuasive speech, formally oratory, in political life and the law courts.&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities.&lt;ref name="Halm, in Rüpke ed, 241 – 2"&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 241 – 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Public prayers (''[[:wikt:prex|prex]]'') were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 239 – 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Livy]] reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the [[Feriae Latinae|Latin festival]] forgot to include the "Roman people" among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 41.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 235 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oaths—sworn for the purposes of business, [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientage and service, patronage and protection]], state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities. Refusal to swear a lawful oath ''([[sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]])'' and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine.&lt;ref name="Halm, in Rüpke ed, 241 – 2" /&gt; A ''[[votum]]'' or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.

=== Sacrifice ===
[[File:Stockholm - Antikengalerie Opferszene.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Roman [[relief sculpture|relief]] depicting a scene of sacrifice, with [[libation#Ancient Rome|libations]] at a flaming altar and the ''[[victimarius]]'' carrying the sacrificial axe]]
In Latin, the word ''[[:wikt:sacrificium|sacrificium]]'' means the performance of an act that renders something ''[[:wikt:sacer|sacer]]'', sacred. Sacrifice reinforced the powers and attributes of divine beings, and inclined them to render benefits in return (the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'').

Offerings to [[household deity|household deities]] were part of daily life. [[Lares]] might be offered spelt wheat and grain-garlands, grapes and first fruits in due season, honey cakes and honeycombs, wine and incense,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; food that fell to the floor during any family meal,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 28, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; or at their [[Compitalia]] festival, honey-cakes and a pig on behalf of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 31: Dionysius of Halicarnassus claims the Compitalia contribution of honey-cakes as a Servian institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant [[Lemures]], might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', 2.500 – 539. See also Thaniel, G., Lemures and Larvae, ''The American Journal of Philology'', 94.2, (1973) 182–187: the offering of black beans is distinctively [[chthonic]]. Beans were considered seeds of life. Lemures may have been the restless dead who had not passed into the underworld, and still craved the life they had lost. Beans were a ritual pollution for Jupiter's priesthood, possibly because his offerings must be emasculated and thus devoid of generative power.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
{{further|October Horse|Tauromachy|Taurobolium|Haruspicy}}
The most potent offering was [[animal sacrifice]], typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the [[pax deorum|harmonisation of the earthly and divine]], so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (''di superi'', "gods above") was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a white heifer (possibly a white cow); [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] a white, castrated ox (''bos mas'') for the annual oath-taking by the [[Roman consul|consuls]]. ''Di superi'' with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'' – including the Emperor's – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (''[[exta]]'', the innards). Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271"&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263 – 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chthonic]] gods such as [[Dis pater]], the ''[[di inferi]]'' ("gods below"), and the collective shades of the departed ''([[Manes|di Manes]])'' were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as "the living cannot share a meal with the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Though the household Lares do just that, and at least some Romans understood them to be ancestral spirits. Sacrifices to the spirits of deceased mortals are discussed below in [[Religion in ancient Rome#Funerals and the afterlife|Funerals and the afterlife]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] was given a pregnant cow at the [[Fordicidia]] festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. [[Robigo]] (or [[Robigus]]) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the [[Robigalia]] for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271" /&gt;

{{anchor|piaculum}}
A sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an [[expiation]] of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (''[[:wikt:piaculum|piaculum]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 81 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcsynr0fQIoC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
a ''piaculum'' might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the [[Arval Brethren]], for instance, offered a ''piaculum'' before entering their [[sacred grove]] with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
The pig was a common victim for a ''piaculum''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464 L, or the Hazards of Interpretation", in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 99, note 129 [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEtE8c1jGY4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online]; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EB4fB0inNYEC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;lr=&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.] The [[Augustus|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] (8.9.1–11) says [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|P. Decius Mus]] is "like" a ''piaculum'' when he makes his vow to sacrifice himself in battle (''[[devotio]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the [[Second Punic War]], Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ''[[ver sacrum]]''), to be rendered after five more years of protection from [[Hannibal]] and his allies.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following [[Trajan]]'s death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21: but this need not imply sacrifice as a mutual contract, breached in this instance. Evidently the gods had the greater power and freedom of choice in the matter. See Beard et al., 34: "The gods would accept as sufficient exactly what they were offered – no more, no less." Human error in the previous annual vows and sacrifice remains a possibility.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pompeii]], the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 78, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Exta}}
The ''exta'' were the entrails of a [[animal sacrifice|sacrificed animal]], comprising in [[Cicero]]'s enumeration the gall bladder (''fel''), liver (''iecur''), heart (''cor''), and lungs (''pulmones'').&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De divinatione'' 2.12.29. According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Natural History'' 11.186), before 274 BC the heart was not included among the ''exta''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''exta'' were exposed for [[litatio]] (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were "read" in the context of the ''[[disciplina Etrusca]]''. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the ''exta'' and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat ''(viscera)'' is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The ''exta'' of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (''[[Olla (Roman pot)|olla]]'' or ''aula''), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with ''[[mola salsa]]'' (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was ''[[:wikt:porricere|porricere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "The Roman Religion", in ''Historia Religionum: Religions of the Past'' (Brill, 1969), vol. 1, pp. 471–472, and "Roman Sacrifice", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 79; [[John Scheid]], ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003, originally published in French 1998), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human sacrifice ====
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented. After the [[Battle of Cannae|Roman defeat at Cannae]] two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the [[Forum Boarium]], in a stone chamber "which had on a previous occasion [228 BC] also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings".&lt;ref&gt;Livy 22.55-57&lt;/ref&gt; Livy avoids the word "sacrifice" in connection with this bloodless human life-offering; Plutarch does not. The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.57.4; Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'', 83 &amp; ''Marcellus'', 3. For further context and interpretive difficulties, see Beard et al., Vol. 1, 81: the live burial superficially resembles the punishment of Vestals who broke their vows. A living entombment assuages the blood-guilt of the living: the guilty are consigned to earth deities. But the Vestals are entombed outside the city limits, not its centre; no sacrificial victims are burned in either case, and the Gauls and Greeks appear to be personally guiltless.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the [[First Punic War]] (264 BC) the first known Roman [[gladiator]]ial ''munus'' was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the ''[[manes]]'' of a Roman military aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 18-19: citing Livy, summary 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The gladiator ''munus'' was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the ''di manes'' or other gods. The event was therefore a ''sacrificium'' in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Prudentius]], ''Contra Symmachum'' 1.379–398; see Donald G. Kyle, ''Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The small woollen dolls called ''Maniae'', hung on the Compitalia shrines, were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to [[Mother of the Lares|Mania, as Mother of the Lares]]. The [[Junii]] took credit for its abolition by their ancestor [[Lucius Junius Brutus|L. Junius Brutus]], traditionally Rome's Republican founder and first consul.&lt;ref&gt;The sacrifice was demanded by an oracle during the reign of the last king, the Etruscan [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. See Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.7 &amp; Lilly Ross Taylor, "The Mother of the Lares", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', '''29'''.3, (July – September 1925), pp 299 – 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice, whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses; [[Marcus Marius Gratidianus]] was a gruesome example.

Officially, human sacrifice was obnoxious "to the laws of gods and men". The practice was a mark of the [[barbarian]]s, attributed to Rome's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls. Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty. A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the [[druid]]s as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain. Despite an empire-wide ban under [[Hadrian]], human sacrifice may have continued covertly in [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 233 – 4, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic and private cult ===
[[File:Vindobona Hoher Markt-142.JPG|thumb|Small bronze statues of gods for a ''lararium'' (1st to 3rd century AD, [[Vindobona]])]]

The ''mos maiorum'' established the dynastic authority and obligations of the citizen-''paterfamilias'' ("the father of the family" or the "owner of the family estate"). He had priestly duties to his ''[[lares]]'', domestic ''[[penates]]'', ancestral ''Genius'' and any other deities with whom he or his family held an interdependent relationship. His own dependents, who included his slaves and freedmen, owed cult to his ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 36-8: the ''paterfamilias'' held – in theory at least, and through ancient right – powers of life and death over every member of his extended ''familia'', including children, slaves and freedmen. In practice, the extreme form of this right was seldom exercised, and was eventually limited by law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Severy, 9-10 for interpretation of the social, economic and religious role of the ''paterfamilias'' within the immediate and extended family and the broader community.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Genius'' was the essential spirit and generative power – depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan ([[gens]] (pl. ''gentes''). A ''paterfamilias'' could confer his name, a measure of his ''genius'' and a role in his household rites, obligations and honours upon those he fathered or adopted. His freed slaves owed him similar obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', vol 1, 67-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''pater familias'' was the senior priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his ''lares'' and ''penates'', and to his ''di parentes''/''divi parentes'' at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife (''mater familias'') was responsible for the household's cult to Vesta. In rural estates, bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. Household cults had state counterparts. In Vergil's ''Aeneid'', Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the ''[[lares]]'' and ''[[penates]]'' from Troy, along with the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] which was later installed in the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', 1997, 2-3, citing Vergil, ''Aeneid'', 8,306-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Religio'' and the state ==
&lt;!--'RELIGIO' is italicized above because it's the Latin word, which the section defines; please don't change to "religion"--&gt;
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Portrait d'Antonin le Pieux 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (reigned 138–161 AD) in ritual attire as an [[Arval Brothers|Arval Brother]]]]
Roman ''[[:wikt:religio#Latin|religio]]'' (religion) was an everyday and vital affair, a cornerstone of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', Roman tradition or ancestral custom.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Care for the gods, the very meaning of ''religio'', had therefore to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was "necessary". Religious behavior – ''pietas'' in Latin, ''eusebeia'' in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. 'When pious travelers happen to pass by a [[lucus|sacred grove]] or a cult place on their way, they are used to make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to sit down for a while' ([[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1).&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, (verbatim) in Rüpke (ed), 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings, according to the principle ''[[do ut des]]'' ("I give, that you might give"). Proper, respectful ''religio'' brought social harmony and prosperity. Religious neglect was a form of [[atheism]]: impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were ''[[vitium|vitia]]'' (impious errors). Excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were ''[[Religion in ancient Rome#Divination, magic and superstition|superstitio]]''. Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (''ira deorum'') and therefore harm the State.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions, and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors. Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 3, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official cults were state funded as a "matter of public interest" (''[[res publica]]''). Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities. The difference between public and private cult is often unclear. Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities. The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults, and held the state-funded (thus public) opening ceremony for the [[Parentalia]] festival, which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors. Some rites of the ''domus'' (household) were held in public places but were legally defined as ''privata'' in part or whole. All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and ''pontifices''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 9-15: citing legal definitions from Festus (epitome of Verrius Flaccus) "De verborum significatu" p.284 L: in Wissowa, 1912, 398ff: and Geiger, 1914): see also Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public priesthoods and religious law ===
&lt;!--The article Titii links to this section; if changing the section subhead, please change the link in that article as well (if redistributing content as well, what the Titii article wants is just a structural description of Roman priesthoods); Sodales Augustales ditto--&gt;[[File:Ara pacis fregio lato ovest 2 A.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Flamines wearing their distinctive pointed headgear (grouped to the left), in a panel from the [[Ara Pacis]]]]
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class. The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices, officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes. Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as [[Haruspex|''haruspices'']] and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the ''paterfamilias'' functioned as priest, and members of his ''familia'' as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the ''[[Flamen|flamines]]'' (the singular is ''flamen''), attributed to king Numa: the major ''flamines'', dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser ''flamines'' were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. ''Flamines'' were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter's ''flamen'' in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 39 – 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Regal era, a ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' (king of the sacred rites) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king (''rex'') or in his absence, and announced the public festivals. He had little or no civil authority. With the abolition of monarchy, the collegial power and influence of the Republican ''pontifices'' increased. By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical ''collegia''. The ''rex sacrorum'' had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the [[Vestal Virgins|Vestals]] and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 18 – 34, 54 – 61: "[the underlying purpose being that] whoever bore the title ''rex'' should never again be in a position to threaten the city with tyranny." See also [[Religion in ancient Rome#Religion and politics|Religion and politics]] in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public priests were appointed by the ''collegia''. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 104 – 8: there can be no doubt that politicians attempted to manipulate religious law and priesthoods for gain; but were compelled to do so lawfully, and often failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, in Rüpke (ed), 331 – 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For those who had reached their goal in the ''[[Cursus honorum]]'', permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia ''seviri'' offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business.&lt;ref&gt;See Gradel, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial ''cursus honorum''. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the [[Arval Brethren]], once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every 3 January they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Vestals ====
[[File:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|150px|A [[Roman sculpture]] depicting a [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]]]]
The [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]] were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], goddess of the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame]]. A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her [[paterfamilias|father's authority]]. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Vestal's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women, with elements of both virgin bride and daughter, and Roman matron and wife.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 52 – 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike male priests, Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children, and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced: a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 51 – 54, 70 – 71, 297. For comparison of Vestal constraints to those of Jupiter's flamen, see Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 39 – 40&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties, which were considered essential to the security of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 50 – 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta's flame. The Vestals cared for the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home. Besides their own festival of [[Vestalia]], they participated directly in the rites of [[Parilia]], [[Parentalia]] and [[Fordicidia]]. Indirectly, they played a role in every official sacrifice; among their duties was the preparation of the ''[[mola salsa]]'', the salted flour that was sprinkled on every [[sacrificial victim]] as part of its immolation.&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

One mythological tradition held that the mother of Romulus and Remus was a Vestal virgin of royal blood. A tale of miraculous birth also attended on [[Servius Tullius]], sixth king of Rome, son of a virgin slave-girl impregnated by a disembodied [[phallus]] arising mysteriously on the royal hearth; the story was connected to the ''[[fascinus]]'' that was among the cult objects under the guardianship of the Vestals.

Augustus' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor [[Claudius]] appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified [[Livia]], wife of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 193-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor [[Gratian]] refused the office of ''pontifex maximus'', he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor [[Theodosius I]] extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple.

=== Augury ===
{{Main|Augur}}
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an [[augur]]. The original meaning of the Latin word ''templum'' was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271" /&gt; Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary ''([[pomerium]])'' had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural ''templum'' appear to have been the [[Via Sacra]] (Sacred Way) and the pomerium.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the ''templum'' before, during and after an act of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (''[[vitium]]'') or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (''ius augurum'') to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 17-20: citing Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt; By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of ''[[pontifices]]'', whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Brent, 21-25"&gt;Brent, 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Haruspicy ====
{{Main|haruspex}}
[[File:Piacenza Bronzeleber.jpg|thumb|The bronze [[Liver of Piacenza]] is an Etruscan artifact that probably served as an instructional model for the haruspex]]
[[Haruspex|Haruspicy]] was also used in public cult, under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate. The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice, particularly the liver. They also interpreted omens, prodigies and portents, and formulated their expiation. Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan "outsider" religious profession, separate from Rome's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 12-20. See also [[John Scheid|Scheid]], in Rüpke (ed), 266.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-to-late Republic, the reformist [[Gaius Gracchus]], the populist politician-general [[Gaius Marius]] and his antagonist [[Sulla]], and the "notorious [[Verres]]" justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, in Rüpke (ed) 336 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect: none of this seems to have troubled Marius, who employed a Syrian prophetess.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero finds all forms of divination false, except those used in State rituals; most Romans were less skeptical. See Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 300, and Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Omens and prodigies ====
[[Omen]]s observed within or from a divine augural templum – especially the flight of birds – were sent by the gods in response to official queries. A magistrate with ''ius augurium'' (the right of augury) could declare the suspension of all official business for the day (''obnuntiato'') if he deemed the omens unfavourable.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar used his ''ius augurium'' to declare ''obnuntiato'' to Cicero's disadvantage: and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an apparently negative omen could be re-interpreted as positive, or deliberately blocked from sight.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 65 – 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prodigy (divination)|Prodigies]] were transgressions in the natural, predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune. The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false, or genuine and in the public interest, in which case it was referred to the public priests, augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 207 BC, during one of the Punic Wars' worst crises, the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved "at least twenty days" of dedicated rites.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman ''religio''. The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of  "greater victims". The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a [[rooster|cock]] (and vice versa) – these were expiated with "lesser victims". The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 295 – 8: the task fell to the haruspex, who set the child to drown in the sea. The survival of such a child for four years after its birth would have between regarded as extreme dereliction of religious duty.&lt;/ref&gt; and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Regina]], singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 27.37.5–15; the hymn was composed by the poet [[Livius Andronicus]]. Cited by Halm, in Rüpke (ed) 244. For remainder, see Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious restitution is proved only by Rome's victory.&lt;ref&gt;See Livy, 22.1 ff: The expiatory [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|burial of living human victims]] in the Forum Boarium followed Rome's defeat at Cannae in the same wars. In Livy's account, Rome's victory follows its discharge of religious duties to the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Livy's use of prodigies and portents as markers of Roman impiety and military failure, see Feeney, in Rüpke (ed), 138 – 9. For prodigies in the context of political decision-making, see Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 295 – 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wider context of Graeco-Roman religious culture, Rome's earliest reported portents and prodigies stand out as atypically dire. Whereas for Romans, a comet presaged misfortune, for Greeks it might equally signal a divine or exceptionally fortunate birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Republic, a daytime comet at the murdered Julius Caesar's funeral games confirmed his deification; a discernible Greek influence on Roman interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funerals and the afterlife ==
{{Main|Roman funerals and burial}}
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy. The traditional care of the dead, however, and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion. Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 35 – 6: Rome's Latin neighbours significantly influenced the development of its domestic and funerary architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 35 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.

[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[Early Christian inscriptions|earliest Christian inscriptions]] (3rd century), this funerary [[stele]] preserves the traditional abbreviation ''D. M.'', ''Dis Manibus'', "for the Manes gods", with the Christian motto in Greek ''Ikhthus zōntōn'' ("fish of the living") and the identity of the deceased in Latin]]
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with "a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient". Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the ''di Manes'', who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the [[Parentalia]], a multi-day festival of remembrance in February.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 267, 270 – 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard Roman funerary inscription is ''Dis Manibus'' (to the Manes-gods). Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, ''theoîs katachthoníois''&lt;ref&gt;From a Romano-Athenian veteran's tomb; [[René Cagnat|Cagnat, René]], ''Inscriptiones Graecae ad res Romanas pertinentes.''
Paris 1906–27, 3.917.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lugdunum]]'s commonplace but mysterious "dedicated under the trowel" ''(sub ascia dedicare)''.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke, (ed) 186 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of ''novemdialis'' found a part-match in the Christian ''Constitutio Apostolica''.&lt;ref&gt;This recommended Christian commemorative rites on the 3rd, 9th &amp; 30th days after death.&lt;/ref&gt; The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the "drunken" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying [[Feralia]] and [[Caristia]] in sufficient numbers for the [[Council of Tours]] to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly [[relic]]s, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to "new life".&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, in Rüpke, (ed), 114 – 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and the military ==
[[File:ML - Genius Legion.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Genius (mythology)|genius]] of the legion (2nd–3rd century CE)]]
Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective ''virtus'' (roughly, "manly virtue") and the divine will: lack of ''virtus'', civic or private negligence in ''religio'' and the growth of ''superstitio'' provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster. Military success was the touchstone of a special relationship with the gods, and to Jupiter Capitolinus in particular; triumphal generals were dressed as Jupiter, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 44, 59 – 60, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman commanders offered vows to be fulfilled after success in battle or siege; and further vows to expiate their failures. [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] promised Veii's goddess Juno a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion ''([[evocatio]])'', conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome "with miraculous ease" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, T., in Walbank et al., 299, citing Livy 21.8-9 and 22.3-6. Livy describes this as ''[[:wikt:evocatio|evocatio]]'' (a "calling forth") initiated by Roman soldiers who snatched the goddess's sacrificial portion during her Veiian rites; the Veiian priest had announced that whoever possessed the sacred entrails would win the coming battle. Preview via googlebooks [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qXuay2SEtIC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=evocatio+Livy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tw18ellncZ&amp;sig=CCmiclyD6vybeYE6Bn-HlHayjuE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VU_pS7C3EJGjsQbymMTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=evocatio%20Livy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual; in effect they were Rome in miniature. The commander's headquarters stood at the centre; he took the auspices on a dais in front. A small building behind housed the legionary standards, the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era, the image of the ruling emperor. In one camp, this shrine is even called Capitolium. The most important camp-offering appears to have been the ''suovetaurilia'' performed before a major, set battle. A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a ''lustratio exercitus'') and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars. The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine ''templum''; all within are purified and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Moede, in Rüpke (ed), 171, &amp; Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 326 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:010 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel X.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Panel from [[Trajan's Column]] depicting the [[lustrum|lustral]] procession of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'' victims under military standards]]
Each camp had its own religious personnel; standard bearers, priestly officers and their assistants, including a haruspex, and housekeepers of shrines and images. A senior magistrate-commander (sometimes even a consul) headed it, his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty. As in Rome, whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business; legionary forts and ''vici'' included shrines to household gods, personal deities and deities otherwise unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 324 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest Imperial era, citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his ''familia'' on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows. They celebrated Rome's official festivals ''in absentia'', and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire, Jupiter, [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] and [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] were typical. By the early Severan era, the military also offered cult to the Imperial ''divi'', the current emperor's ''numen'', ''genius'' and ''domus'' (or ''familia''), and special cult to the Empress as "mother of the camp". The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to [[Mithras]] of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into [[Sol Invictus|Solar]] and Stoic [[Monism]] as a focus of military [[Concordia (mythology)|''concordia'']] and Imperial loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 268-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r2hBqYtZWNEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA249&amp;lpg=RA1-PA249&amp;dq=Hadrian+dominus+noster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iGyQvK9dmg&amp;sig=vaZeVEzQcQBaBNI50TAs25R5b1M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5B8Sp-3HpzLjAedq6SIBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Le Bohec, 249: limited preview available via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VqM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22mother+of+the+camp%22+severus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhNo0AFEQu&amp;sig=0MDpTCprN9nfkIIDa8eFLwUCbhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gah8Sp_IO9SG-QbovLVb&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mother%20of%20the%20camp%22%20severus&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Dixon, 78: limited preview available from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jupiter dolichenus 3rd century Carnuntum.jpg|thumb|upright|A votive statue of [[Jupiter Dolichenus]] dedicated by a [[centurion]] for the wellbeing of the emperor ([[Carnuntum]], 3rd century)]]
The ''[[devotio]]'' was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make, promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods. Livy offers a detailed account of the ''devotio'' carried out by [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Decius Mus]]; family tradition maintained that [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|his son]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|grandson]], all bearing the same name, also devoted themselves. Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim's liver appears "damaged where it refers to his own fortunes". Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a [[Novensiles#The invocation of Decius Mus|prayer recorded by Livy]], Decius commits himself and the enemy to the ''dii [[Manes]]'' and [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]], charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering. Had he failed to die, his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void, with possibly disastrous consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 5.21.3., &amp; 8.9.8; Beard ''et al''., Vol 1, 35 – 36; Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 312; Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of ''devotio'' is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman [[Gladiator#Gladiators and the military|gladiator]].

The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful. In the early days of Rome's war against Carthage, the commander [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)]] launched a sea campaign "though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices". In defiance of the omen, he threw them into the sea, "saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. He was defeated, and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger Glycias, as if again making a jest of his country's peril." His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 3OO, citing Suetonius, Tiberius, 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women and religion ==
:''See also [[Women in ancient Rome#Religious life|Women in ancient Rome: Religious life]]''

Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.,'' Vol. 1, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the [[Bona Dea]] excluded men entirely.&lt;ref&gt;''Beard ''et al.,'' Vol. 1, 296 – 7. This exclusion prompted prurient speculation on the part of men, and a scandalous, impious intrusion by [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the ''paterfamilias''. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], and [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|specialized divine attendants]] presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.

Literary sources vary in their depiction of women's religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to self-indulgent religious enthusiasms, novelties and the seductions of ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 297. ''Ibid'' 217, citing the obituary of a woman whose virtues included "''religio'' without ''superstitio''" ([[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]] 8393.30-31 of "Turia").&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Superstitio''&lt;!--THIS IS THE LATIN FORM, hence the italics; DO NOT CHANGE TO ENGLISH 'superstition'--&gt; and magic ==
{{See also|Magic in the Greco-Roman world}}
[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]] depicting masked characters in a scene from a play: two women consult a witch]]
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were ''[[superstitio]]'', in the sense of "doing or believing more than was necessary",&lt;ref name="Rüpke, in Rüpke ed, 5"&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone.&lt;ref&gt;See Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries between ''religio'' and ''superstitio'' are perhaps indefinite. The famous tirade of [[Lucretius]], the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as "superstition" was in fact aimed at excessive ''religio''. Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith,&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''superstitio'' was viewed as an "inappropriate desire for knowledge"; in effect, an abuse of ''religio''.&lt;ref name="Rüpke, in Rüpke ed, 5" /&gt;

In the everyday world, many individuals sought to divine the future, influence it through magic, or seek vengeance with help from "private" diviners. The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods, not foretelling the future. Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect. So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit, subversive or magical purposes. Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times, notably in 139 BC and 33 BC. In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death. "Egyptian rites" were particularly suspect: Augustus banned them within the ''pomerium'' to doubtful effect; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., 230 – 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several Imperial bans, magic and astrology persisted among all social classes. In the late 1st century AD, Tacitus observed that astrologers "would always be banned and always retained at Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, in Rüpke (ed), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, in Flint ''et al''., 83: citing Pliny, ''Natural History'', 28.17 – 18; Seneca, ''Natural Questions,'' 4.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 231 – 233, citing Tacitus, ''Histories'', 1.22. Tacitus' prediction was accurate: in the late 3rd century, Diocletian issued a general ban on astrology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Graeco-Roman world, practitioners of magic were known as ''[[magi]]'' (singular ''magus''), a "foreign" title of Persian priests. [[Apuleius]], defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as "in popular tradition ''(more vulgari)''... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (''vi cantaminum'') for everything he wishes to."&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apologia'', 26.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] offers a thoroughly skeptical "History of magical arts" from their supposed Persian origins to Nero's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 30.1 – 18; see also Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] takes pains to point out that the celebrated [[Apollonius of Tyana]] was definitely not a ''magus'', "despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to vanish into thin air".&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 217 – 219 &amp; 224, citing Philostratus, ''Life of Apollonius'', I.2, IV.18, V.12, VII.11,20,33-4,39, VIII.5,7,19,30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucan]] depicts [[Sextus Pompeius]], the doomed son of [[Pompey the Great]], as convinced "the gods of heaven knew too little" and awaiting the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] by consulting with the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] witch [[Erichtho]], who practices [[necromancy]] and inhabits deserted graves, feeding on rotting corpses. Erichtho, it is said, can arrest "the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers" and make "austere old men blaze with illicit passions". She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods, mankind and destiny. A female foreigner from Thessaly, notorious for witchcraft, Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature,&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 219 – 20, citing Lucan, Pharsalia,VI.413 – 830.&lt;/ref&gt; along with Horace's Canidia.

[[File:Magical book Kircherian Terme.jpg|thumb|left|Bound tablets with magic inscriptions from late antiquity]]
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation (''[[malum carmen]]'', or 'noisome metrical charm'); this included the "charming of crops from one field to another" (''excantatio frugum'') and any rite that sought harm or death to others. [[Chthonic]] deities functioned at the margins of Rome's divine and human communities; although sometimes the recipients of public rites, these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the ''pomerium''. Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze, during the hours of darkness. Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The barrier between private religious practices and "magic" is permeable, and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public [[Feralia]] festival that are indistinguishable from magic: an old woman [[Squatting position|squats]] among a circle of younger women, sews up a fish-head, smears it with pitch, then pierces and roasts it to "bind hostile tongues to silence". By this she invokes Tacita, the "Silent One" of the underworld.

Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells (''[[defixiones]]''), [[Greek Magical Papyri|magical papyri]] and so-called "voodoo dolls" from a very early era. Around 250 ''defixiones'' have been recovered just from [[Roman Britain]], in both urban and rural settings. Some seek straightforward, usually gruesome revenge, often for a lover's offense or rejection. Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs, in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate, and promise a portion of the value (usually small) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration. None of these ''defixiones'' seem produced by, or on behalf of the elite, who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice. Similar traditions existed throughout the empire, persisting until around the 7th century AD, well into the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 186: about 200 of these British defixiones are from Sulla-Minerva's spring in urban Bath and the remainder from a shrine to a Celtic deity ([[Nodens]]), at rural Uley. For ''defixiones'' as direct appeals to divine justice, see Belayche, in Rüpke (ed), 286. For the widespread persistence of curse-tablet rituals, see Ogden, in Flint ''et al''., 3 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Roman religion ==

=== Religion and politics ===
[[File:Baalbek-Bacchus.jpg|thumb|right|text|[[Temple of Bacchus]] ("Temple of the Sun"), c. 150 AD]]
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
Rome's government, politics and religion were dominated by an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy. Approximately half Rome's population were slave or free non-citizens. Most others were [[plebeians]], the lowest class of Roman citizens. Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights; far fewer could actually exercise them. Women had no vote.&lt;ref&gt;During the Augustan era, the city of Rome probably housed around a million people, including an unknown number of provincials: by Mouritsen's estimate, around 200,000 Roman citizens were eligible to vote in Rome itself during the late Republican era but during major elections, the influx of rural voters and the bottleneck of the city's ancient electoral apparatus meant that perhaps 12% of eligible citizens actually voted. This nevertheless represents a substantial increase from the estimated 1% adult male enfranchisement rights of 145 BC. At any time, the overwhelming majority of citizens – meaning the plebs – had minimal direct involvement in central government. See Henrik Mouritsen, Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic (Cambridge, U.K., Cambridge University Press, 2001), 32ff.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices, in the name of the senate and people of Rome. "In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine, just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans".&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome's internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 59 – 60.&lt;/ref&gt; They resorted to [[Conflict of the Orders|strikes and violence]] to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, in Rüpke (ed), 283: citing Plutarch, Camillus, 42. Belayche describes this as a votive offering (''uotum''), which "offered a supernatural legitimacy for decisions or actions... [and] entailed being assisted and reassured, through the forwarding of hopes or dis-
appointments, anger or contentment, to superior powers." See also Versnel, Henrik S., (ed), "Religious mentality in ancient prayer," in Versnel, Henrik S., Faith, Hope and Worship: Aspects of Religious Mentality in the Ancient World, Leyden, 1981, pp 1 – 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious calendars and [[Twelve Tables|laws]] were eventually made public. [[Tribune of the plebs|Plebeian tribunes]] were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians.&lt;ref&gt;The ''collegia'' were opened to plebs by the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'' of 300 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;"The change that comes about at the end of the republic and solidifies under Augustus is not political, but cultural". Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 72: citing Habinek, T., and Schiesaro, A., (eds.) ''The Roman Cultural Revolution.''

While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Punic crisis, popular cult to [[Dionysus]] emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with [[Liber|Father Liber]], the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman [[Bacchus]]. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial [[Bacchanalia]] cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of [[Marsyas#Prophecy and free speech at Rome|Marsyas]], the ''[[Silenus|silen]]'' of Dionysus flayed by [[Apollo]], became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; [[Liberalia|Liber's festival]] continued.&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 72: "...the change that comes about at the end of the republic and solidifies under Augustus is not political, but cultural. Most of the members of the priestly colleges in Augustus’ time continued to be aristocrats, but the real power and control over religion and the calendar now flowed from professional experts, such as the polymath Varro, because they had the power of knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two centuries later, when Decius and Diocletian required universal sacrifice to Roman gods as a test of loyalty, any traditional gods served the purpose: loyal compliance with Imperial dictat made them Roman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society. In the middle Republican era, even [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]]'s tentative hints that he might be Jupiter's special protege sat ill with his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Scipio did not claim personal connections with Jupiter; but he did not deny rumours to that effect. Contrary to usual practice, his ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imago]]'' (funeral mask) was stored in the Temple of Jupiter.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal; both [[Sulla]] and [[Pompey]] claimed special relationships with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Julius Caesar went further; he claimed her as [[Venus (mythology)#Epithets|his ancestress]], and thus an intimate source of divine inspiration for his personal character and policies. In 63 BC, his appointment as ''pontifex maximus'' "signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics".&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public ''ludi'' and ''munera'' whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise, electoral bribery ([[ambitus]]): see Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 2.3: see also Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 65 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[principate]], such opportunities were limited by law; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ("first citizen").
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because of you we are living, because of you we can travel the seas, because of you we enjoy liberty and wealth." ''A thanksgiving prayer offered in Naples' harbour to the princeps Augustus, on his return from Alexandria in 14 AD, shortly before his death.''&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 310.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Early Republic ===
&lt;!-- This section should illuminate Rome's internal struggles; for example, the dictator Camillus' promise to found a temple to Concordia, against the background of conflict between Patricians and Plebs.  --&gt;
[[File:Affreschi romani - Ercolano - Teseo liberatore1.JPG|thumb|A fresco depicting [[Theseus]], from [[Herculaneum]] ([[Ercolano]]), Italy, 45-79 AD]]
By the end of the [[Roman Kingdom|regal period]] Rome had developed into a city-state, with a large plebeian, artisan class excluded from the old patrician ''[[Gens|gentes]]'' and from the state priesthoods. The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours; according to tradition, Rome's [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] connections established a temple to [[Minerva]] on the predominantly plebeian [[Aventine hill|Aventine]]; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, installed in a Capitoline temple, built in an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan style]] and dedicated in a new September festival, ''[[Epulum Jovis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"From Etruria the Romans derived the idea of housing a deity in a temple and of providing him with a cult statue. ... The most famous... dedicated in the first year of the Republic to the Etruscan triad, Tinia, Uni and Minerva. Of these deities, however, two were Italian, Juno and Minerva, while Tinia was identified with Jupiter." Howard Hayes Scullard, (2003), A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC, page 397. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned, as if noble guests, at their own inaugural banquet.

Rome's diplomatic agreement with its neighbours of [[Latium]] confirmed the [[Latin league]] and brought the cult of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] from [[Aricia, Italy|Aricia]] to the Aventine.&lt;ref&gt;"Her cult at Aricia was first attested in Latin literature by [[Cato the Elder]], in a surviving quote by the late grammarian [[Priscian]]. Supposed Greek origins for the Aricia cult are strictly a literary [[topos]]." Arthur E. Gordon, "On the Origin of Diana", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 63 (1932, pp. 177-192) page 178 note, and page 181.&lt;/ref&gt; and established on the Aventine in the "commune Latinorum Dianae templum":&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Ling. Lat.'' v. 43&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)#Iuppiter Latiaris and Feriae Latinae|Jupiter Latiaris]] was built on the [[Alban Hills|Alban mount]], its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome's inclusive hegemony. Rome's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the ''[[Pomerium|pomoerium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Pomoerium.html ''Pomoerium''], ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', page 930-1. London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cult to [[Hercules]] at the ''[[Great Altar of Hercules|ara maxima]]'' in the [[Forum Boarium]] was established through commercial connections with [[Tibur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Ara_Maxima_Herculis.html ''Ara Maxima Herculis''], ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', page 253-4. Oxford University Press, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tusculum|Tusculan]] cult of [[Castor (mythology)|Castor]] as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the [[Forum Romanum]]:&lt;ref&gt;"Traditionally in 499, the cult of Castor and Pollux was introduced from Tusculum and temple was erected in the Forum." Howard Hayes Scullard, (2003), A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC, page 398. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juno Sospita]] and [[Juno Regina]] were brought from Italy, and [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Fortuna Primigenia]] from [[Praeneste]]. In 217, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 23.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later Republic to Principate ===
The disasters of the early part of Rome's [[second Punic War]] were attributed, in Livy's account, to a growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury and the neglect of Rome's traditional gods, whose anger was expressed directly in Rome's defeat at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] (216 BC). The Sibilline books were consulted. They recommended a general vowing of the ''[[ver sacrum]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Ver_Sacrum.html ''Ver Sacrum''], ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', page 1189, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year, the burial of two Greeks and two Gauls; not the first or the last of its kind, according to Livy.

The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays. In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic [[Magna Mater]] (Great Mother) from [[Pessinus]], installed on the [[Palatine hill|Palatine]] in 191 BC. The mystery cult to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in 186 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/romrelig2.html#Livy2 ''Dionysius and the Bacchanalia, 186 B.C.''] from Livy: ''History of Rome''.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium: temples were dedicated to [[Juventas]] ([[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]) in 191 BC,&lt;ref&gt;''Hebe'' entry in ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. 1867&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ([[Artemis]]) in 179 BC, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] ([[Ares]]) in 138 BC), and to [[Bona Dea]], equivalent to [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]], the female counterpart of the rural [[Faunus]], supplemented by the Greek goddess [[Damia (goddess)|Damia]]. Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman [[Penates]] as forms of the Greek [[Dioscuri]]. The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma (identified with Roman [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the Egyptian mystery-goddess [[Isis]] and Persian [[Mithras]].)

[[File:Pallas-athena-roman-mosaic.jpg|thumb|A 3rd-century Roman [[Pallas Athena]] [[mosaic]] from [[Tusculum]], now in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]
The spread of Greek literature, mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome's festivals and rituals, and the embellishment of its mythology. [[Ennius]] translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian [[Euhemerus]], who explained the genesis of the gods as [[apotheosis|apotheosized]] mortals. In the last century of the Republic, [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] and particularly [[Stoicism|Stoic]] interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held – or had held – high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Scaevola]] and the polymath [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]. For Varro – well versed in Euhemerus' theory – popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.

Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods, so did some individual Romans. In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity. Most notably in the very late Republic, the [[Julii]] claimed [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Genetrix]] as ancestor; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult. The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil's poetic, Imperial vision of the past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[File:Affreschi romani - polifemo presenza galatea - pompei.JPG|thumb|''[[Polyphemus]] hears of the [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|arrival of Galatea]]''; ancient [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] painted in the [[Pompeian Styles|"Fourth Style" of Pompeii]] (45-79 AD)]]
In the late Republic, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] reforms lowered an existing property bar on conscription and increased the efficiency of Rome's armies but made them available as instruments of political ambition and factional conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke, (ed), 65&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent civil wars led to changes at every level of Roman society. Augustus' [[principate]] established peace and subtly transformed Rome's religious life – or, in the new ideology of Empire, restored it (see [[Religion in ancient Rome#Imperial cult|below]]).

Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' became a ''de facto'' consular prerogative.&lt;ref name="Brent, 21-25" /&gt; Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of ''pontifex maximus''; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient [[Arval Brethren|Arvales]], his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the [[Vestal Virgins|Vestals]] as a visible restoration of Roman morality.&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 76. See also [[Res Gestae]].&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus obtained the ''pax deorum'', maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.

=== Roman Empire ===

==== Absorption of cults ====
[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Mithras]] in a Roman wall painting]]
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures; in principle, Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin, Etruscan and other Italian peoples, cults and deities as Roman. Those who acknowledged Rome's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of Roman religious law.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Epistles, 10.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Newly municipal [[Sabratha]] built a Capitolium near its existing temple to [[Liber Pater]] and [[Serapis]]. Autonomy and concord were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models.&lt;ref&gt;As at Narbonne and Salona. See Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at [[Cuicul]] are of emperors or [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]. By the middle of the 1st century AD, Gaulish [[Vertault]] seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, Romanised cult nearby: by the end of that century, Sabratha's so-called [[tophet]] was no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice, not a centralised legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Major cult centres to "non-Roman" deities continued to prosper: notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian [[Serapium]], the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo's sacred wood at Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall scarcity of evidence for smaller or local cults does not always imply their neglect; votive inscriptions are inconsistently scattered throughout Rome's geography and history. Inscribed dedications were an expensive public declaration, one to be expected within the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit but by no means universal. Innumerable smaller, personal or more secretive cults would have persisted and left no trace.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 180 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of ''Romanitas''. Rome's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities, including their traditional gods, the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the ''diis deabusque omnibus'' (all the gods and goddesses). They also brought Roman "domestic" deities and cult practices with them.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann-Heinimann, in Rüpke (ed), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traders, legions and other travellers brought home cults originating from Egypt, Greece, Iberia, India and Persia. The cults of [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Mithras]], and [[Sol Invictus]] were particularly important. Some of those were initiatory religions of intense personal significance, similar to Christianity in those respects.

==== Imperial cult ====
[[File:MaisonCarrée.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Maison Carrée]] in [[Nîmes]], one of the best-preserved [[Roman temple]]s.  It is a mid-sized [[Augustus|Augustan]] provincial temple of the Imperial cult.]]
{{Main|Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|l1=Imperial cult of ancient Rome}}
In the early Imperial era, the [[princeps]] (lit. "first" or "foremost" among citizens) was offered ''genius''-cult as the symbolic ''paterfamilias'' of Rome. His cult had further precedents: popular, unofficial cult offered to powerful benefactors in Rome: the kingly, god-like honours granted a Roman general on the day of his [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; and in the divine honours paid to Roman magnates in the Greek East from at least 195 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 32-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 272-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deification of deceased emperors had precedent in Roman domestic cult to the ''dii parentes'' (deified ancestors) and the mythic [[apotheosis]] of Rome's founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State ''divus'' (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor's deceased wife, sister or daughter could be promoted to ''diva'' (female divinity).

The first and last Roman known as a living ''divus'' was [[Julius Caesar]], who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy; he was murdered soon after. Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar's successor, Augustus, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 3, part 1, 3: citing Cassius Dio, 51, 20, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his "reformed" and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his ''numen''. By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, book 1, 77 &amp; 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, book 1, 97-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an empire of great religious and cultural diversity, the Imperial cult offered a common Roman identity and dynastic stability. In Rome, the framework of government was recognisably Republican. In the Provinces, this would not have mattered; in Greece, the emperor was "not only endowed with special, super-human abilities, but... he was indeed a visible god" and the little Greek town of [[Akraiphia]] could offer official cult to "liberating Zeus Nero for all eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As [[princeps]] (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living ''divus'' but father of his country (''pater patriae''), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the ''dii manes'' was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a ''divus'', he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of ''divus'' as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 263-8, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his ''genius''; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 46-56, 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jews and Roman religion ====
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects in 2nd-century [[gold glass]] from Rome]]
{{See also|Fiscus Judaicus|Religio licita|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate, Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea's Hellenised elite. [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them. Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period. Judaea's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora; in Rome, this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion. Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate ''collegia'' by Julius Caesar. By the Augustan era, the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 266 – 7, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 2-3, 4-6: the presence of practicing Jews in Rome is attested "at least a century" before 63 BC. Smallwood describes the preamble to Judaea's clientage as the Hellenising of ruling Jewish dynasties, their claims to kingly messianism and their popular, traditionalist rejection in the Maccabaean revolt. In Rome, the more "characteristically Jewish" beliefs and customs were subjects of scorn and mockery.[https://books.google.com/books?id=jSYbpitEjggC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Jews+smallwood+actium+Parthia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWsQGlsrv8&amp;sig=1P-nIzMEdJTf6R0WrQTaT9aMrKo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VfooSsKeIZSDjAfBwpn3Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Books.Google.co.uk] ''Ibid'', 120-143 for early Roman responses to Judaistic practice; but see also Tessa Rajack, "Was there a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies,'' 74, (1984) 107-23; no "Roman charter" for Judaism should be inferred from local, ''ad hoc'' attempts to suppress anti-Jewish acts (as in Josephus' account); Judaism as ''religio licita'' is only found later, in Tertullian. Cicero, ''pro Flacco, 66'', refers to Judaism as ''superstitio''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods under Roman rule, Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice, under certain conditions. Judaism was a ''superstitio'' to Cicero, but the [[Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] described it as ''[[religio licita]]'' (an officially permitted religion) in contrast to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 2-3, 4-6:  ''superstitio'' in Cicero, ''pro Flacco'', 66, but legislation by Julius Caesar recognised the synagogues in Rome as legitimate ''collegia'' and Augustus maintained their status. Josephus infers an early "charter" offering protection to Jews, but Tessa Rajack, "Was there a Roman Charter for the Jews?" Journal of Roman Studies, 74, (1984) 107-23, finds evidence only for Rome's official suppression of anti-Jewish activities. ''Religio licita'' is first found much later than this, in Tertullian.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity in the Roman Empire==== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{See also|Pentarchy|History of Christianity|Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|State church of the Roman Empire}}
Roman investigations into early Christianity found it an irreligious, novel, disobedient, even atheistic sub-sect of Judaism: it appeared to deny all forms of religion and was therefore ''superstitio''. By the end of the Imperial era, Nicene Christianity was the one permitted Roman ''religio''; all other cults were heretical or pagan ''superstitiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', vol. 1, 225: citing Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'', 10.96.8, &amp; Beard et al., Vol. 2, 11.11a: citing Tacitus, ''Annals'', 15.44.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD, Emperor [[Nero]] accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats, who were later [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of early Christians by Romans|persecuted]] and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. &lt;!-- Fix preceding. Interpreted and cited from here, apart from final section --&gt;During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, "contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms", regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless, who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Rome's elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.

In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, the emperor [[Decius]] decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to "ancestral gods" or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 241-3: see 242 for Decian "libellus" (certificate) of oath and sacrifice on papyrus, dated to 250 AD.&lt;/ref&gt; Decius' edict appealed to whatever common ''mos maiores'' might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults: see Leppin, in Rüpke, (ed), 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apostasy]] was sought, rather than capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EgCRHxfouQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Diocletian+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7_IdIU_pqN&amp;sig=UDSeRqdJLL5vX2gbIktCTtx58Bc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SLN8SqW5EonE-QaVm-1J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocletian%20Imperial%20cult&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Rees, 60.

[[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60"&gt;Rees, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In another edict, he described Christianity as a threat to Empire – not yet at its heart but close to it, among Rome's equites and Senators. Christian apologists interpreted his eventual fate – a disgraceful capture and death – as divine judgement. The next forty years were peaceful; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile, due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence. [[Origen]] discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius' predecessor [[Philip the Arab]] in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a "pagan" basis in Christian heresies.&lt;ref&gt;See Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 98 – 99; citing Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 6.19.15; 21.3–4; 36.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian churches were disunited; Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 both for his doctrines, and for his unworthy, indulgent, elite lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 99; citing Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 7.29–30: Paul actually remained in office until "Aurelian's victory over Palmyra in 272, when he was forced to leave the 'building of the church'...&amp;nbsp;Political conflicts, local rivalry, and theological debates converged in this quarrel."&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Aurelian]] (270-75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (''concordia militum''), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] ''[[Sol Invictus]]'' in Rome's [[Campus Martius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, in Bowman et al. (eds), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 295, [[Maximilian of Tebessa]] refused military service; in 298 [[Marcellus of Tangier|Marcellus]] renounced his military oath. Both were executed for treason; both were Christians.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60" /&gt; At some time around 302, a report of ominous [[haruspicy]] in [[Diocletian]]'s ''domus'' and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered [[Diocletianic Persecution|a series of edicts]] against Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, II.6.10.1-4. A date of 302 is regarded as likely. [[Eusebius]] also says the persecutions of Christians began in the army; see Eusebius, II.8.1.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first (303 AD) "ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts, forbade services to be held, degraded officials who were Christians, re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians, and reduced the legal rights of all Christians... [Physical] or capital punishments were not imposed on them" but soon after, several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 103: citing Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'', 14.2; Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 8.6.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 8.2.5, 8.6.10.&lt;/ref&gt; An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods, in terms that recall the Decian edict.

In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred. Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, [[Constantius Chlorus]], the father of [[Constantine I]]. Diocletian's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311, when he asked Christians to pray for him. "This meant an official recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire, although one of the tetrarchs, Maximinus Daia, still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313."&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 103: citing Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'', 34 &amp; 13 &amp; ; Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 8.17.3–10 &amp; 8.2.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Emperor Constantine and Christianity =====
[[File:Trier - Aula Palatina.JPG|thumb|The [[Aula Palatina]] of [[Trier]], [[Germany]] (then part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]]), built during the reign of [[Constantine I]] (r. 306-337 AD)]]
The conversion of [[Constantine I]] ended the Christian persecutions. Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the ''[[pax deorum]]'' with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was (in traditional Roman terms) auspicious – or in Christian terms, what was orthodox. The edict of Milan (313) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration. Constantine had triumphed under the ''signum'' (sign) of the Christ: Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new [[Constantinople|Eastern capital]], Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests. He passed laws to protect Christians from persecution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also funded the building of churches, including [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's basilica]].  He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the ''genius'' of living emperors, though his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine's permission for a new cult temple to himself and his family in Umbria is extant: the terms are vague – cult "should not be polluted by the deception of any contagious superstition". See Momigliano, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine promoted orthodoxy in Christian doctrine, so that Christianity might become a unitary force, rather than divisive. He summoned Christian bishops to a meeting, later known as the [[First Council of Nicaea]], at which some 318 bishops (mostly easterners) debated and decided what was orthodox, and what was [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. The meeting reached consensus on the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Chrisme Colosseum Rome Italy.jpg|thumb|Monogramme of Christ (the [[Chi Rho]]) on a plaque of a [[sarcophagus]], 4th-century CE, marble, Musei Vaticani, on display in a temporary exhibition at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy]]
&lt;!--This summary was moved from above: Imperial cult became a focus of theological and political debate during the ascendancy of Christianity under [[Constantine I]]. The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] failed to reverse the declining support for Rome's traditional cults: [[Theodosius I]] adopted Christianity as the Imperial State religion. Officially, the "Imperial cult" was abandoned, along with all cults other than Imperially sanctioned forms of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, 142-158.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
Christianity and traditional Roman religion proved incompatible. From the 2nd century onward, the [[Church Fathers]] had condemned the diverse non-Christian religions practiced throughout the Empire as "pagan".&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Brown, in Bowersock ''et al.'', ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', Harvard University Press, (1999), for "pagan" as a mark of socio-religious inferiority in Latin Christian polemic: [https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA625&amp;dq=pagus+paganus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's actions have been regarded by some scholars as causing the rapid growth of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman empire. A.D.100-400. Yale University Press. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; though revisionist scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stephenson, Constantine: Unconquered emperor, Christian victor (2009) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, ''The Triumph of Christianity: How the Jesus Movement Became the World's Largest Religion'' (Harper Collins 2011) pp. 169-182&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's unique form of Imperial orthodoxy did not outlast him. After his death in 337, two of his sons, [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]], took over the leadership of the empire and re-divided their Imperial inheritance. Constantius was an [[Arianism|Arian]] and his brothers were Nicene Christians.

Constantine's nephew [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] rejected the "Galilean madness" of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of [[neo-Platonism]], Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult. Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism, attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation is available online at the Wisconsin Lutheran College website – [http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/imperial-laws-chart FourthCentury.com] (accessed 30 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the "irrational impieties" of Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See Julian's ''Against the Galilaeans'' (trans. Wright, from Cyril of Alexandria's later refutation, ''Contra Julianum'') at [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_galileans_1_text.htm Tertullian.org] (accessed 30 August 2009). Julian admired the work of the Platonist (or neo-Platonist) [[Iamblichus]].&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The empire once again fell under Christian control, this time permanently.

In 380, under [[Theodosius I]], [[Nicene Christianity]] became the official [[state church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]]. [[Christian heresy|Christian heretics]] as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, though Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms,&lt;ref name="Stefan Heid 2007 pp. 406"&gt;Stefan Heid, "The Romanness of Roman Christianity", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 406–426; on vocabulary in particular, Robert Schilling, "The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.

The Western emperor [[Gratian]] refused the office of ''pontifex maximus'', and against the protests of the senate, removed the [[altar of Victory]] from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. [[Theodosius I]] briefly re-united the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] to the Western and Eastern emperors. [[Ambrose]], the influential [[Bishop of Milan]] and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence is available online at Internet Medieval Sourcebook: Letter of St. Ambrose, trans. H. De Romestin, 1896., [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ambrose-sym.html Fordham.edu] (accessed 29 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} He was the last emperor of both East and West.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JNIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=pacatus+theodosius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cS8Cv0vBOb&amp;sig=z2ML87tEYOAa8iZPAJ5iWLX-LQI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nyaYSunGKKCQjAfHmbWzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pacatus%20theodosius&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Williams &amp; Friell, 65-67.

'''Religious satire''' is a form of [[satire]] targeted at [[religious]] [[belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"/&gt; From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with [[politics]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PA116 pp.116-8] quotation: {{quotation|...religion, politics, and sexuality are the primary stuff of literary satire. Among these sacret targets, matters costive and defecatory play an important part. ... from the earliest times, satirists have utilized scatological and bathroom humor. Aristophanes, always livid and nearly scandalous in his religious, political, and sexual references...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1973) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5NZAAAAMAAJ ''Satire--that blasted art''] p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnwhAQAAIAAJ ''Menippeans &amp; Their Satire: Concerning Monstrous Leamed Old Dogs and Hippocentaurs''], in Scholia satyrica, Volume 6, 3/4, 1980 p.45 quotation: {{quotation|[Chapple's book ''Soviet satire of the twenties'']...classifying the very ''topics'' his satirists satirized: housing, food, and fuel supplies, poverty, inflation, "hooliganism", public services, religion, stereotypes of nationals (the Englishman, German, &amp;c), &amp;c. Yet the truth of the matter is that no satirist worth his salt (Petronius, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift, Leskov, Grass) ever avoids man's habits and living standards, or scants those delicate desiderata: religion, politics, and sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire. Religious satire can be the result of [[agnosticism]] or [[atheism]]. Religious satire surfaced during the [[Renaissance]], with works by Chaucer, Erasmus and Durer.

==Reactions, criticism and censorship==

Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not 
be subject to ridicule.  In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Molière's play ''[[Tartuffe]]'' was banned in 1664.

The film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/7530542.stm Vicar supports Life of Brian ban]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dyke, C: ''Screening Scripture'', pp. 238-240. Trinity Press International, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters.  According to the [[Monty Python|Pythons]], ''Life of Brian'' is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Secret Life of Brian |year= 2007 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDCAJTrF1gg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[freedom of speech]] was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the [[Religious Hatred Bill]] in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the [[House of Lords]] making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Votes on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill | year = 2006 | url = http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/search.php?query=racial+and+religious+hatred+bill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Church of the SubGenius#Legal matters|Rachel Bevilacqua]], a member of the [[Church of the SubGenius]], known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's [[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]] festival.

[[Richard Dawkins]] frequently points out that there is no reason to exclude religion from objective studying like any other social phenomena.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[Image:Religious syms.svg|thumb|Various [[religious symbols]]]]
'''Religious studies''', alternately known as the '''study of religion''', is an academic field devoted to research into [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While [[theology]] attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as [[deities]]),  religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including [[anthropology of religion|anthropology]], [[sociology of religion|sociology]], [[psychology of religion|psychology]], [[philosophy of religion|philosophy]], and [[history of religion]].

Religious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the [[Bible]] had flourished, and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist texts]] were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included [[Friedrich Max Müller]], in England, and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Cornelius P. Tiele]], in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.S. Adcock|title=The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UMfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, it was known as "[[comparative religion]]" or the '''science of religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular [[Mircea Eliade]], from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). 

The religious studies scholar [[Walter Capps]] described the purpose of the discipline as to provide "training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}} At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use "prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible."{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}}
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as "a subject matter" that is "open to many approaches", and thus it "does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status."{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xvii}}

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xvi}} Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=15}}

Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]] world.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=6–7}} It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=7–10}}

==Etymology==
The term "[[religion]]" originated from the Latin noun ''religio'', that was nominalized from one of three verbs: ''relegere'' (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); ''religare'' (to bind oneself [back]); and ''reeligere'' (to choose again).&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P.  ''Catholicism.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these three different potential meanings, an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term "religious" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a "religious").

==Defining "religion"==
[[File:Totem poles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Totem pole]]s reflect the beliefs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]; some religious studies scholars argue that the term "religion" is too Western-centric to encompass the beliefs and practices of communities such as these]]

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term "religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xviii}} Many of these have been ''monothetic'', seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define "religion" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Capps|1y=1995|1p=xviii|2a1=Herling|2y=2016|2p=37}} There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are ''substantive'', seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} The second are ''functional'', seeking to define "religion" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} Other forms of definition are ''polythetic'', producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}}

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various [[secularism|secular]] world views, such as [[nationalism]] and [[Marxism]], which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.{{sfn|Smart|1998|pp=22–26}}

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term "religion" altogether and cease trying to define it.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=36}} In this perspective, "religion" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism.{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}} According to scholar of religion [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], "many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever".{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=10}} There is, for instance, no word for "religion" in languages like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}}

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Before religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s,  several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[William James]]. His 1902 [[Gifford lectures]] and book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''[[The Will to Believe]]'' defends the rationality of faith.

[[Max Weber]] studied religion from an economic perspective in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in [[sociology]], he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
[[Émile Durkheim]] also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Max Muller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Müller]]]]Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[ca.]] 550 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and [[Herodotus]] (ca. 484 BCE &amp;ndash; 425 BCE). Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]]ic scholars such as [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064 CE) studied [[Zoroastrianism|Persian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Indian religions]], among others. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]. [[Peter the Venerable]], also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. [[Max Müller]] was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at [[Oxford University]], a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xv}}

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the [[University of Ibadan]], where [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Parrinder|first=Ursula|last=King|date=4 August 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093222/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', [[Ninian Smart]] wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[United States|America]], "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including [[Hinduism|Indian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]].)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of [[God]], belief and rationality, [[religious cosmology|cosmology]], and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''e.g.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]'s debate concerning original sin), the rise of [[scholasticism]] in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of [[Aristotle]]) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The [[anthropology of religion]] is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===
The [[cultural anthropology]] of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823202612/http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.&lt;ref name=GallupE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx|title=Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912113232/http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/religion-provides-emotional-boost-world-poor.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/religions-correlation-with-poverty/ between religion and poverty].

===Geography of religion===
The geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the "Berkeley school" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. 
Since the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the "politics and poetics" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest{{when|date=September 2018}} in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.

===History of religion===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the [[historicity]] of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M. Schultz and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', 78 (March 2010), 129–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''[[God: A Biography]]'', by [[Jack Miles]].

===Neurological approaches===
The [[temporal lobe]] has been of interest which has been termed the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) [[Neurological]] findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a [[SPECT]]scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Origin of religion===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Revelation}}
The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in [[prehistory]], before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. [[William James]]'s [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of [[religious conversion]], the making of religious decisions, [[religion and happiness]], and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

[[Sigmund Freud]] was another figure in the field of psychology and religion.  He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
{{main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the [[dialectic]]al relationship between religion and [[society]]; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[Concretization|reification]] of religious practise.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|economic foundations of society]]. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like [[France]] or [[Scandinavia]] outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?"&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Paul, "Cross-national correlations of quantifiable societal health with popular religiosity and secularism in the prosperous democracies," ''Journal of Religion &amp; Society'' (2005) 1#1 pp 1-17 [http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123104528/http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf |date=2014-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and religion ===
{{main|Law and religion}}
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new "law and religion" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the ''Journal of Law and Religion'' first published that year and the ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Howard J. | year = 1983 | title = A Survey and Commentary on the New Literature in Law and Religion | journal = Journal of Law and Religion | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 79–169 | jstor=1051074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Religion and film===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like [[Jean Epstein]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=16}}
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=13}} Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=14}}

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are [[hermeneutic]]s, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology ]] is "arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century." (Partridge)  The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of [[German Idealism]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], entitled [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]].  Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by [[Edmund Husserl]], who is considered to be its founder.  In the context of [[Phenomenology of religion]] however, the term was first used by [[Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye]] in his work "Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] influence, "phenomenology" came to "refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts." (Partridge)  Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is [[consciousness]].  He recognized "how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations." (Partridge)  Husserl introduced the term "eidetic vision" to describe the ability to observe without "prior beliefs and interpretations" influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the [[epoche]]: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator.  The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes.  In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.  Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]].  In his ''Religion in Essence and Manifestation'' (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within....The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to "acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self."
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which "all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate 'reality' thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation" (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817094359/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/phenom.htm source]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called "encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encountered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or "eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was "the distinctive method of the discipline".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion [[Thomas Ryba]] noted that this approach to the study of religion had "entered a period of dormancy".{{sfn|Ryba|2006|p=119}}
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with [[Robert A. Segal]] stating that it amounted to "no more than data gathering" alongside "the classification of the data gathered".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}

===Functionalism===
[[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]], in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Connolly|title=Approaches to the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0PUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to [[teleology|teleological]] explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the [[Pentateuch]] as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (''i.e.'' a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
[[Lived religion]] is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion "la religion vécue".&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall|David Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence.  Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which [[Anselm of Canterbury]] gave to it in the 11th century, [[credo ut intelligam]], or faith seeking understanding (literally, "I believe so that I may understand").  The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes.  The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M. Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300-1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, [[Richard E. King]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with [[postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. "Exporting the Local: Recent Perspectives on 'Religion' as a Cultural Category." ''Religion Compass'' 1.6 (2007), pp. 787-800.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly journals==
Much of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Eidson, "Electronic journals in religious studies: Theological libraries prepare for the digital future." ''Journal of Religious &amp; Theological Information'' 3.3-4 (2001): 45-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate L. Ganski, "Accessibility of E-resources from Theological Library Websites."

'''Religious symbolism in the United States military''' includes the use of religious symbols for [[military chaplain]] insignia, uniforms, emblems, flags, and chapels; symbolic gestures, actions, and words used in military rituals and ceremonies; and religious symbols or designations used in areas such as headstones and markers in national cemeteries, and military ID tags ("[[dog tag]]s").

Symbolism sometimes includes specific images included or excluded because of religious reasons, choices involving colors with religious significance, and "religious accommodation" policies regarding the wear of "religious apparel" and "grooming" (such as "unshorn" hair and beards worn for religious reasons) with military uniforms. Additionally, military chaplains themselves are sometimes regarded as "symbols of faith" for military personnel who face challenges to their faith and values.&lt;ref name="reagan"&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 wwwpresidency.ucsb.edu].

==Chaplain insignia by military service==

===Army===
[[File:Shepherd's Crook Chaplain Insignia.jpg|thumb|left|The "Shepherd's Crook," the original insignia authorized for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] chaplains, 1880–1888, and still included as part of the [[United States Corps of Chaplains|U.S. Army Chaplain Corps]] regimental insignia]]

On July 29, 1775, the [[Continental Congress]] established the military chaplaincy, but chaplains did not wear insignia until 1880.
&lt;ref name="colors"&gt;[http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Colors/US_Army_Branch_Colors.htm www.alternatewards.com]. Retrieved June 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1835 Army Regulations prescribed black as the branch color for chaplains, directing that a chaplain wear a black coat.&lt;ref name="colors"/&gt; By 1861, US Army Regulations included the details that the chaplains should wear a single breast officer's frock coat made of black wool, with black cloth covering the buttons, and no shoulderboards.&lt;ref name="qm"&gt;[http://www.quartermastershop.com/CW%20US%20Officer/chaplain_frockcoat.html www.quartermastershop.com]. Retrieved May 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the Army Uniform Board "enhanced" the [[frock coat]] by adding black "herringbone braid" in across the chest at the buttons and buttonholes, with buttons still covered in black.&lt;ref name="qm"/&gt; This coat was used by army chaplains until 1880, when shoulder boards were authorized for chaplains for the first time, and the first official insignia was introduced.&lt;ref name="qm"/&gt;

Although the [[Latin Cross|Latin cross]] has long been the symbol for the majority of United States military chaplains, this first official chaplain insignia was the "[[shepherd's crook]]" (staff).&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[http://www.chaplain.us www.chaplain.us]. Retrieved May 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Authorized in General Order Number 10, and remaining in force for the period February 13, 1880 – May 5, 1888, it was described as "embroidered frosted silver bullion in center of black velvet shoulder straps, and was considered appropriate for both the frock coat or undress uniform."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; The plain "Latin cross" (silver on dark-blue shoulder straps) became the authorized chaplain insignia in 1898, replacing the shepherd's crook.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Today, despite the fact that the shepherd's crook is no longer used as an insignia for individual chaplains, it is included in the design of the Chaplain Corps regimental insignia in honor of its place in Army Chaplain Corps history.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;[http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/Branch_Insignia/Branch_Insignia_Information/chaplain-corps.shtml www.armystudyguide.com]. Retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish chaplains were first authorized to serve during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but it was during [[World War I]] that the issue of insignia reached the army, when Congressman [[Isaac Siegel]] from New York petitioned the army that rabbis serving in uniform be permitted to wear "some other insignia in place of the cross."&lt;ref name="rabbis"&gt;Slomovitz, Albert Isaac, ''The Fighting Rabbis: Jewish Military Chaplains and American History'', 1999, New York University Press, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two weeks of receiving this request, the army issued a directive stating that "Objections having been made to Jewish Chaplains wearing the prescribed insignia, you are authorized by the [[Secretary of War]] to omit the prescribed insignia" (the cross).&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;"Army correspondence Concerning Jewish Insignia, NA-CCC-RG247, cited in Slomovitz, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after battlefront reports indicated that difficulties arose from the fact that Jewish chaplains wore no insignia, the army began to look into various proposals, including a continuation of the practice of having Jewish chaplains wear no insignia, to the creation of a separate insignia for them, to a return to the shepherd's crook as a shared symbol for all chaplains.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; General [[Henry Jerver]], acting assistant chief of staff for the army favored the third alternative, and within weeks of his decision this became the official policy for the Army.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; However, many Christian chaplains opposed this change of policy, and in August 1918 General Pershing cabled the War Department to inform it of this opposition.&lt;ref name="ac"/&gt; Not all Christian chaplains opposed the idea of a universal symbol, and some went on record agreeing with the statement of one chaplain that "I am a chaplain of the Christian faith, but I welcome the change. The shepherd's crook is symbolic of the chaplain's work."&lt;ref&gt;"Army and Navy Journal," July 20, 1918, as cited in Slomovitz, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to a consideration of the three options of no insignia for Jewish chaplains, a shared insignia, or a separate insignia, the army opted for a separate Jewish chaplain insignia that included an image of the two tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], using [[Roman numerals]] to indicate the commandments, with a small six-pointed [[Jewish star]] on top of the tablets.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; Other symbols considered included a six-pointed star ([[hexagram]]), which was rejected by the army because it could too easily be confused with the 5-pointed star worn by generals; a seven-branched candelabra ([[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]); and two "[[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]]" supporting the six-pointed star.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt;

This symbol would remain the insignia for Jewish chaplains until 1981, when the navy changed its insignia to include the first ten letters of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] alphabet—to replace the Roman numerals—and both the army and the air force followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/branches/Chaplains%20Corps.htm# |title=Jewish Chaplain insignia |access-date=2011-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205074157/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/branches/Chaplains%20Corps.htm# |archive-date=2008-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slomovitz, op. cit., p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; While the official change to Hebrew letters became official November 9, 1981&lt;ref name="ask"&gt;[http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/armybranches/blchap.htm USMilitary.about.com].

The [[Continental Navy]], predecessor of the United States Navy, was approved by the [[United States Congress]] on October 13, 1775, with navy regulations (adopted November 28, 1775) that included as its second article: "The Commanders of the ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen United Colonies]] are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent." But, while the need for navy chaplains was recognized from the beginning, attitudes and policies toward navy uniforms or insignia for its chaplains went through many changes before final decisions were made.&lt;ref name="perrinot"&gt;Perrenot, Preston B.[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkCBRExR94QC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=navy+shepherd's+crook+chaplain+insignia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mFKJySHwmW&amp;sig=BlG86c1Tfq39trmd6oa6yAiDdNM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s9zPTbuAM9DqgQer6NG-DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=navy%20shepherd's%20crook%20chaplain%20insignia&amp;f=false United States Navy Grade Insignia Since 1852, pg 92], copyright 2009 by Preston Perrinot. Retrieved May 15, 2011. (Chaplain Corps insignia section: pages 91-102.)&lt;/ref&gt; 1847 navy regulations did authorize chaplains to wear a blue uniform with black collar and cuffs with no insignia, and later, in 1864, chaplains were provided the same uniform as other staff officers, with the use of a silver cross as a corps device.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

However, regulations for navy chaplain uniforms and insignias changed a number of times over the following years: 1869–1876, when chaplains were considered as officers without rank, they wore the cross without any additional "sleeve lace"; in 1876, uniforms were no longer authorized for chaplains, who were to wear either civilian clothing or the vestments appropriate to their faith group; in 1883, the uniform became an option for chaplains, with the cross; and then in 1894, the epaulets and passants were removed so that chaplain uniforms had no insignia at all, neither any that indicated they were officers nor even the cross signifying that they were chaplains.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

It was not until 1905 that the navy uniform code included a permanent regulation for chaplains: along with ranks equivalent to line officers, they were to wear naval officer's uniforms with the sleeve braid in "lustrous black" (not gold, like that of other officers), and to wear both the officer rank insignia and a gold cross.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; In 1918, naval staff corps rules were changed, and the distinctive black braid of chaplains was replaced by the same gold braid worn by other officers, along with the Latin cross.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

The navy policy on insignia for Jewish chaplains was not resolved as quickly as it was in the army. When Rabbi David Goldberg entered the navy October 30, 1917,&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Adam M., [http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2006/Sep/06Sep_Goldberg.pdf "Jewish Culture and the American Military"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815115932/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2006/Sep/06Sep_Goldberg.pdf# |date=2011-08-15 }}, Naval Postgraduate School Thesis, September 2006, pg. 19.

When Goldberg's request to wear the six-pointed star was rejected—based on the same fears the army had that a six-pointed star would be too similar to the five-pointed star worn by flag officers—he recommended the shepherd's crook as a universal symbol, a recommendation that met with opposition from many Christian chaplains.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; However, the Navy did authorize Goldberg to wear that symbol himself, in place of the cross.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; Goldberg wore this insignia until the end of [[World War II]], when navy policy eventually changed to allow navy Jewish chaplains to wear the tablets and the star, the same insignia worn by Jewish chaplains in the army.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; This change took place in 1941,&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; after only two Jewish chaplains (Goldberg and Harold Strauss) had worn the Shepherd's Crook insignia.&lt;ref name="jewishpress"&gt;Southwest Jewish Press, October 11, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the shepherd's crook has not been used as a chaplain insignia since that time, the term used for the active duty chaplain with the earliest appointment is the "Gray Shepherd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/virginian-pilot-ledger-star-norfolk/mi_8014/is_20060312/gerald-sargent/ai_n41307082 findarticles.com].

The [[United States Merchant Marine]] is a civilian auxiliary of the United States Navy, but in accordance with the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1936]] its members are considered military personnel during times of war when the merchant marine comes under the navy. Until World War I, merchant mariners did not wear uniforms, but they were introduced in 1919, because "young Americans now entering the merchant service have more regards for themselves and their job when wearing a uniform, and that the merchant sailor commands greater respect when ashore, either at home or in foreign ports, if in uniform.&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/09/97081981.pdf "Merchant Sailors Garb distinguished from that of Navy by stripes and insignia," The New York Times, March 9, 1919].

===Air Force===
On July 28, 1942, Chaplain Charles Carpenter was appointed to the newly created position of air chaplain for the [[Army Air Force]], within the larger [[United States Army]] organization. Later, when the [[United States Air Force]] was established as a separate service on September 18, 1947, the original plan was that chaplain support would continue to be provided by Army chaplains. However, on May 10, 1949, the decision was made that the still new branch of the military would have its own chaplains. At that point, chaplains serving with the Air Force began to wear Air Force uniforms, but continued to use the same Jewish and Christian Chaplain Corps insignia that had been used by the Army. In 1981, when the Navy approved the change to the Jewish chaplain insignia, from Roman numerals to Hebrew letters, both the Army and Air Force made the same change soon thereafter. Since then, the approval of insignia to represent chaplains of other faith groups has been made jointly by of all branches of the United States Armed Forces. However, while the designs for the insignia are the same for all services, the Air Force categorizes the insignia as "[[Badges of the United States Air Force|occupational badges]]," with different "wear use" rules than the other services.&lt;ref&gt;Air Force Instruction 36-2903, "Dress and personal appearance of Air Force personnel."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, while the [[Civil Air Patrol]] chaplain program is a separate organization than the USAF Chaplain Corps, it was established in 1950 under the guidance of the Air Force chief of chaplains and "is modeled after the Air Force Chaplain Service," and follows the same rules for faith group insignia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryatheists.org/regs/CAPReg265-1v2007.pdf Civil Air Patrol Regulation 265-1 of May 9, 2007].

The Jewish Chaplain insignia made up of two tablets of the Ten Commandments, with ten Roman numerals symbolizing the commandments, and with the six-pointed Star of David above the tablets, was adopted for Jewish army chaplains in 1917, and for Jewish naval chaplains in 1941.

{{quote|The Jewish Chaplain Corps device as it now appears, with Roman numerals representing the Ten Commandments, has been worn with pride by all previous and present Jewish chaplains. It is felt, however, that a change to Hebrew characters at this time would be unanimously and enthusiastically received by Jewish chaplains and Jewish personnel as a source of still greater pride, reflecting as it would a more significant and authentic representation of a heritage and faith eternally related to Hebrew as the language of the [[Old Testament]] and the [[prophet]]s&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt;}}

The President of the Navy Uniform Board approved the change on December 17, 1980,&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt; with the army and air force quickly approving the change as well. (Note that the Roman numeral version read left to right, with the first five numerals on the left tablet and the second five on the right; the Hebrew reads right to left, with the first five numerals on the right and the second five on the left, as per Jewish tradition. Jewish tradition states that the tablets had flat tops and may even have been square instead of rectangular, but the Christian-influenced rectangular tablets with round tops is nonetheless very frequently found in Jewish art and synagogues, and was not objected to here either.) The new insignia was authorized for wear from 1981, with a grace period authorized to allow Jewish chaplains to make the required uniform changes by January 1, 1983.&lt;ref name="emerson"/&gt;

Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival."&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

It appears that my predecessor's guidance in May on the subject of haircuts, beards and sideburns is insufficiently understand and, for this reason, I want to restate what I believed to be explicit: in the case of haircuts, sideburns, and contemporary clothing styles, my view is that we must learn to adapt to changing fashions. I will not countenance the rights or privileges of
any officers or enlisted men being abrogated in any way because they choose to grow sideburns or neatly trimmed beards or moustaches or because preferences in neat clothing styles are at variance with the taste of their seniors, nor will I countenance any personnel being in any way penalized during the time they are growing beards, moustaches, or sideburns.&lt;ref name="zgram"/&gt;}}

One example of visible religious apparel cited in the instructions as authorized, provided it passes the "neat and conservative" test, is the [[kippah]] (skullcap) worn by some Jewish personnel, referred to in some military directives by the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] word, "yarmulke."&lt;ref name="accommodation"/&gt; The modern history of authorizing the kippa under the rubric of "religious accommodation" began with a 1986 Supreme Court case ([[Goldman v. Weinberger]]) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1985/1985_84_1097 ''Goldman v. Weinberger,'' U.S. Supreme Court Case Summary &amp; Oral Argument]&lt;/ref&gt; When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the "neat and conservative" approval rule in a proposed "Religious Apparel Amendment." That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] was read into the ''Congressional Record.''&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Record'', 100th Congress, May 11, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore off a piece of his Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff]]'s kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines.&lt;ref&gt;"Solarz Passes Religious Apparel Amendment", ''The Jewish Press'', May 22, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress Veterans History Project: Arnold Resnicoff collection, AFC/2001/001/70629, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.&lt;ref name="accommodation"/&gt;

Resnicoff's report of the bombing, written at the request of the [[White House]], and read in April 1984 as a keynote speech by President [[Ronald Reagan]], explained the symbolism of Pucciarelli's actions and this kippah:

{{quote|Somehow he wanted those Marines to know not just that we were chaplains, but that he was a Christian and that I was Jewish. Somehow we both wanted to shout the message in a land where people were killing each other—at least partially based on the differences in religion among them—that we, we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt;}}
This story of this "camouflage kippah"—its symbolism in terms of Judaism as a sign of reverence and its symbolism in the military as a sign of interfaith cooperation and respect—was retold at many levels,&lt;ref&gt;Larry Bonko, "Rabbi's Camouflage Yarmulke Woven With Tragedy, Heroism," ''Norfolk Ledger-Star,'' Jan 13, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; including another occasion involving President Reagan, during a White House visit of the "American Friends of Lubavitch."&lt;ref name="wellsprings"&gt;"Rabbis Explain 'Top to Top'," ''Wellsprings,'' No. 12 (Vol 2, No. 7), August–September 1986," Lubavitch Youth Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; After telling them the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the meaning of the kippah. Rabbi [[Abraham Shemtov]] responded, "Mr. President, the kippah to us is a sign of reverence," and one of his colleagues, Rabbi Feller, continued, 'We place the kippah on the very highest point of our being—on our head, the vessel of our intellect—to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect—the infinite Wisdom of God."&lt;ref name="wellsprings"/&gt;

Although a number of military instructions use the Jewish headcovering as an example—noting factors that must be met to qualify under the "neat and conservative" requirement—the same criteria for permission apply to head coverings regardless of the faith of the military person requesting permission: "Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deomi.org/DiversityMgmt/documents/AR_600-20_27_April_2010.pdf Army Regulation 600-20, section 5-6.g.(4).(d).5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003163424/http://www.deomi.org/DiversityMgmt/documents/AR_600-20_27_April_2010.pdf# |date=2011-10-03 }}.

The practice of keeping some tag or mark for identification in case of serious injury or death seems to have begun in the Civil War, when Americans first made them themselves and later were able to purchase commercially made tags, when civilian groups realized there might be a "market" for such items. In 1906 the Army made the tags official and required and ten years later, July 6, 1916, changed to the two tag requirement.&lt;ref&gt;War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, a dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: "P" for Protestant, "C" for Catholic, or "H" for Jewish (from the word "Hebrew," for "Hebrew faith"),&lt;ref name="tags"/&gt; or "NO" or "NONE" (or just no religious designation letter) to indicate no religious preference.&lt;ref name="no"&gt;[http://www.blitzkriegbaby.de/anc/anc3e.htm www.blitzkriegbaby.de].

Eisenhower]] to say that he had tried unsuccessfully to have an "M" (for Muslim) added to his dog tags, and recommending that "M" for "Muslim" or "I" for "Islam" be added to the religious choices for future soldiers.&lt;ref name="mdogtags"&gt;[http://30mosques.com/2010/09/day-25-iowa-cedar-rapids 30mosques.com].

Ironically, although the ID tags include religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them issued or reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands.

==Symbols and military chapels==

===Chapel construction and usage===
[[File:Air Force Academy Chapel, Colorado Springs, CO 04090u original.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Designers of the [[United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel]], used structure, not specific religious symbols, to identify it as a place of worship. Named a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2004]]
[[File:Jewish Chapel Norfolk VA.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|11' x 7' wall-hanging created in 1982 for "[[Commodore Levy Chapel]]," the Navy's oldest land-based Jewish Chapel, [[Naval Station Norfolk]]. No denominational symbol is used, but it includes the biblical verse, "Sing God's praise anew from around the world, all who sail the sea"]]
Beginning in 1940, the policy was established that military chapels would be constructed with no permanent religious symbols, exterior or interior:

{{quote|In 1940, the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives summoned the Chief of Chaplains of the Army for questioning about a budget item which called for the construction of over one hundred chapels at military installations. Their indirect questions on the use of these chapels indicated their uneasiness in dealing with a problem which might evoke interreligious strife in America. Their fears were allayed, and approval for the chapel building program was quickly granted, when the Chief of Chaplains made it clear that the chapels were to be non-denominational in character, with no symbols, either within or without, to denote any particular religious belief. Previously no military chapel had ever been constructed without a cross, but the new policy dictated that henceforth, within the military, the religious sensitivies of all groups were to be scrupulously respected.&lt;ref name="lev"&gt;Lev, Aryeh, "The Impact of the Jewish Chaplaincy," Samuel D. Gershowitz Memorial Lecture, 1962, published by The National Jewish Welfare Board.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although some older military chapels still include religious symbols, and some older military installations (including [[United States Service academies]]) maintain chapels dedicated for specific religious worship, all current instructions and design manuals for new chapel construction and chapel usage follow this 1940 policy, explicitly prohibiting the use of permanent religious symbols, and even direct that temporary religious symbols should be displayed only during scheduled religious services.&lt;ref name="Armychapel"&gt;[http://www.chapnet.army.mil/Documents/r165_1.pdf Army Regulation 165-1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182411/http://www.chapnet.army.mil/Documents/r165_1.pdf# |date=2011-07-22 }}, December 3, 2009, pg. 36.

{{quote|The chapel environment will be religiously neutral when the facility is not being used for scheduled worship. Portable religious symbols, icons, or statues may be used within a chapel during times of religious worship. Symbols are to be moved or covered when not in use during services. Distinctive religious symbols, such as crosses, crucifixes, the Star of David, Menorah, and other religious symbols will not be affixed or displayed permanently on the chapel interior, exterior, or grounds. Permanent or fixed chapel furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, lectern, or communion rail will be devoid of distinctive religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Armychapel"/&gt;}}

The naval facilities design manual for chapels and religious educational facilities includes the following directions:

{{quote|Naval chapels differ from comparable facilities in civilian situations in a number of very significant ways. The most obvious of these is that although they are intended for religious purposes they are owned and operated by a secular institution....

Interfaith Function. A major difference between military and civilian facilities is that the former are nonsectarian and are designed to meet the needs of all military personnel and all faith groups within the same premises. The liturgical and theological understanding that is permanently reflected or given an image in these facilities must be that which is held in common by all religions. The implications of this for architecture are several: Architectural symbols, shapes, or configurations that are denominational or sectarian in character or association should not appear as exterior motifs. Neither should they be permanent elements of the interior within the spaces that are shared by the various faith groups. An exterior example is the spire; interior examples would include details suggestive of the Trinity, the Star of David, the cross, etc. Such symbolic devices may be appropriately among the portable and impermanent furnishings, but must not be fixed.&lt;ref name="Navychapel"/&gt;}}

Similarly, training manuals for religious program specialists prescribe that chapels should be set up with no religious symbols except when the spaces are prepared for religious services:
{{quote|When divine services or religious services are not in progress, the chapel facility should be configured to present a nonsectarian appearance. To do this, you should remove or cover all symbols, statues, or related objects which are characteristic of one particular faith group. How this is accomplished will vary according to the location and arrangement of the chapel. In some cases, items which have been permanently affixed within a chapel and do not present a nonsectarian appearance may be curtained, screened, covered, or possibly even removed. The command chaplain will instruct you as to what action should be taken in these circumstances. Once the facility has been rigged to reflect a nonsectarian appearance, it is a good practice to make and keep a diagram or photograph of the arrangement for future reference in the sacristy/vestry area. It may then be used by any RP who is assigned worship support functions in your facility. This practice may also be used to show the duty RP each arrangement used by each of the chaplains assigned to your facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/religion/14229/css/14229_156.htm Naval Education and Training Manual 14229, U.S. Navy Advancement, Religion Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Air force design policies include the statement, "Do not use religious symbols," in the section on "Exterior elements," and continue the theme in various sections that deal with interior elements as well.&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; For example, in the section on stained glass windows, instructions state "Use stained glass windows in the sanctuary, the blessed sacrament and reconciliation room, and the all faiths room. Ensure they do not contain religious symbols."&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; On the other hand, "The chapel should be easily identifiable with a high, steeply pitched roof over the primary worship space. The use of stained glass sets chapel facilities apart as places of beauty and spiritual inspiration."&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; The overall policy for religious symbols in air force chapels is summed up in the statement that "Because of their multi-faith use, these facilities must be religiously neutral in design, as well as flexible in their programming. Liturgical furnishings specific to individual faith groups must therefore be moveable and architectural form, images and permanent ornamentation acceptable to all users."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afcee.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070919-089.pdf USAF Religious Facilities Design Guide, Chapter 1, Section A]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Removing denominational symbols===
Policies vary among military services when it comes to removing permanent religious symbols from the building or grounds of military chapels that are inconsistent with these policies, and decisions to remove existing symbols have sometimes been met with controversy.

For example, there was some controversy in 2008 when the army announced plans to remove three wooden crosses outside the chapel serving military personnel in Kosovo’s "[[Camp Bondsteel]]," replacing them with a monument displaying the Chaplain Corps seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2008/05/army-plans-to-remove-crosses-from.html "Army Plans to Remove Crosses from Kosovo Base Chapel Grounds"]. Retrieved May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Fox News Channel]], Lieutenant Colonel William D. Jenkins of the 35th Infantry Division's Kosovo Force 9 said that the Base Camp Planning Board approved the removal of the crosses in accordance with army regulations, which require the exterior to be free of any specific faith group symbols.&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,360004,00.html www.foxnews.com]. Retrieved June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins said that "The interior of each U.S. Army chapel reflects faith-specific signs, symbols, etc., during each faith group's service so that their faith is fully represented during their service...[but]The exterior of Army chapels is a different matter since the chapels are used by many different faith groups."&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"/&gt; He said that the crosses would still be used during special services, such as the Easter Sunrise Service.&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"/&gt;

Similarly, a cross was removed from a military chapel in Afghanistan in November 2011, at the "remote post" of Marmal, based on the army regulations prohibiting permanent symbols of any religion or faith group.
&lt;ref name="crossremoval"&gt;Grybowski, Michael, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/removal-of-cross-from-army-chapel-in-afghanistan-stirs-controversy-63053 "Removal of cross from Army chapel in Afghanistan stirs controversy," "The Christian Post, November 25, 2011]. Retrieved December 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in June 1998, the [[National Naval Medical Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] added a crescent to the exterior wall of its chapel, where a cross and Star of David were already displayed, rather than removing all symbols and replacing them with a more inclusive symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paklinks.com/gs/religion-and-scripture/72204-first-muslim-chaplain-in-us-navy.html www.paklinks.com]. Retrieved May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the new symbol for Buddhist chaplains has not been added.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:NNMC Bethesda Chapel 2.jpg|2011 photo of NNMC Bethesda Chapel]]. Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one case a religious symbol has been removed from a chapel and then reinstated when local base leadership changed. In 1994, the commander of [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] in [[Groton, Connecticut]], at the recommendation of the base chaplain, had a cross removed from the top of the "Chapel on the Thames," also known as the "Sailors' Chapel" and the "Submarine Memorial Chapel." The cross, which was not part of the original chapel construction, but had been added some years later, was to be relocated within the chapel area where other religious symbols were kept.&lt;ref&gt;Messick, Sean, "Cross removal draws criticism," Norwich Bulletin, October 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; That action drew criticism from some individuals, including letters to the editor in the local civilian paper, and finally elicited an editorial in that paper defending the decision: "Men of many faiths lost their lives on submarines....The changes being made to Navy places of worship are part of a larger effort to become sensitive to the dignity of all people who serve in the military.... The Navy is a Navy not just of Christians, but of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and others."&lt;ref&gt;"For everyone of faith," "The Day," October 15, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite positions articulated in statements such as this one, the next commanding officer had the cross replaced.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Based on conversations in 2008 regarding crosses outside the chapel at [[Naval Air Station Atsugi]] in [[Japan]], Navy policy sets a higher priority on removing permanent religious symbols from a chapel when it is the only chapel on a base.&lt;ref name="atsugi"&gt;Weaver, Teri, [http://www.stripes.com/news/atsugi-chapel-meeting-soothes-some-concerns-1.83242 "Atsugi chapel meeting soothes some concerns"], "Stars and Stripes, September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Where more than one chapel exists, Navy policy may be more lenient when it comes to existing symbols on one particular chapel.&lt;ref name="atsugi"/&gt; One example is Naval Station Norfolk's Frazier Hall, one of the Navy's oldest chapel complexes, where separate Catholic and Protestant chapels are co-located with Jewish and Muslim Chapels.&lt;ref name="bluestar"&gt;, Sternlicht, Stanford V., "Uriah Phillips Levy: The Blue Star Commodore," 1961, cited in Berent, Irwin M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3onHPhlIR1MC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=commodore+levy+chapel+norfolk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YExc9lXKlG&amp;sig=L0ErDkO64G5zh2QdVrzYeaAKrag&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MZLeTZD6Oerz0gGp2IzgCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=commodore%20levy%20chapel%20norfolk&amp;f=false "Norfolk, Virginia: A Jewish History"], 2001.

The rule requiring chapels to be religiously neutral except during a religious worship service also applies to Veterans Administration chapels.&lt;ref name="vachapel"&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/2591581/ www.wral.com].

====Erecting and removing religious symbols apart from chapels====
A slightly different issue involving a cross on a military base—but erected separately from a chapel as a memorial to marines killed in Afghanistan—involves a 13-foot cross erected on top of a hill at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, in California.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"&gt;Schapiro, Jeff, The Christian Post, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/aclj-veterans-cross-should-stay-62640 "ACLJ: Veterans Cross Should Stay," November 21, 2011]. Retrieved December 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Center for Law &amp; Justice]] is arguing on the part of those who erected the cross that it should be allowed to stay because "crosses are used as a widespread and universal symbol of remembrance," not just as religious symbols, while other groups, such as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, are arguing that the cross should not be allowed to remain.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt; A similar cross was erected in 2003, but was destroyed in a fire, so the new cross has been created with "fire-retardant" material.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt; A spokesman for Camp Pendleton was quoted as saying that the Camp Pendleton "legal staff is carefully researching and reviewing the topic in order to make a balanced and unbiased command recommendation that is ultimately supported by the law."&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt;

====Vandalism using religious symbols====
[[File:USAFA stone circle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dedication of the "Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle" at the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] for "Earth centered" worship]]
In 2010, vandals used a religious symbol in a negative way, adding a wooden cross to a non-Christian military worship area as an apparent attempt to make an anti-religious statement against the "[[Earth religion|Earth-centered"]] worship area ("stone circle") set aside at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] (USAFA) for the use of adherents of faith groups that identify themselves as "[[Paganism (contemporary religions)|Pagans]]," such as Wiccans or Druids.&lt;ref name="stonecircle"&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/crime-93686-hate-examples.html www.gazette.com].

Lieutenant General [[Michael C. Gould]], USAFA Superintendent, said that it was important that the academy support the religious needs of all cadets, and that [https://web.archive.org/web/20120303205729/http://www.adr.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070216-034.pdf USAF Instruction 36-2706] gives air force leaders guidance in terms of defining "religion" as "a personal set or institutional system of attitudes, moral or ethical beliefs and practices held with the strength of traditional religious views, characterized by ardor and faith and generally evidenced through specific religious observances."&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/02/05/cross-placed-air-force-pagan-circle-prompts-probe www.foxnews.com]. Retrieved June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould said that the incident was being taken very seriously, because respect for the religious beliefs of others is an especially important lesson for USAFA cadets, who "learn that to succeed as an Air Force officer we must be able to support and respect the people who we lead, serve with and fight alongside even if they do not share our personal beliefs.... Cadets learn that every servicemember is charged with defending freedom for all Americans and that includes the freedom to practice a religion of their choice or to not practice any religion at all."&lt;ref name="gould"/&gt;

Academy officials took actions to send a clear message that the "Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle," the area set aside for Earth-centered worship, "is to be treated with respect and dignity, just as any other religious structure or location."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/academy-93565-longcrier-worship.html www.gazette.com]. Retrieved June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of symbols as symbol===
It has been pointed out that in some ways the lack of permanent symbols itself becomes a symbol: "a visible symbol of how people of different beliefs can not only tolerate one another, they can live in the same house."
&lt;ref name="MacDill"&gt;Shelton, Janet, [http://www.catholicweb.com/media_index.cfm?fuseaction=view_article&amp;partnerid=30&amp;article_id=440 "The Air Force base’s chapel meets many faiths’ needs to serve Catholics and Protestants"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114190407/http://www.catholicweb.com/media_index.cfm?fuseaction=view_article&amp;partnerid=30&amp;article_id=440# |date=2011-01-14 }}, www.catholicweb.com.

==Symbols in National Cemeteries==

Retrieved June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the creation of the national army that was established at the beginning of the Civil War that army regulations (General Orders Number 75, September 11, 1861) assigned the national commanders of the military with the responsibility for burials and grave markings—and the Quartermaster General of the Army was tasked with providing the actual "headboards."&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt; Much later, following World War I, a board of officers approved the white marble headstone, slightly rounded at the top—and for the first time, two specific religious markings (the Latin Cross for Christians, and the Star of David for Jews) were authorized for use.&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt; Changes in construction and designed continued to be made, and in February 1951, he Secretary of the Army approved the addition of a Buddhist emblem in addition to the Cross and the Star.&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt;

Today, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) establishes policies for religious symbols on headstones and markers in [[United States National Cemeteries]], although the [[United States Department of the Army|US Department of the Army]] continues to oversee two of them, including [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt; In contrast with the small number of religious symbols that have been approved by DOD over the years for chaplain insignia, the VA has approved over forty five separate religious symbols for use on cemetery headstones and markers (those used in national cemeteries and those issued to families of eligible veterans for use in private cemeteries) and has a process in place to consider and approve additional religious symbols based on requests by the next of kin of the deceased.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;

Although current procedures allow for speedy approvals of new religious symbols, the pentacle (the pentagram within a circle), the symbol now used for Wiccan headstones and markers, was approved only after ten years of efforts that concluded with a lawsuit against the VA, resulting in a settlement that accorded that symbol the same status as any other religious or belief system allowed.&lt;ref name="cemetery"&gt;Miller, Geralda [http://www.rgj.com/article/20070424/NEWS10/704240336/Wiccan-symbol-now-official-national-memorials "Wiccan symbols now official for national memorials], RGC.com. Retrieved May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] represented the plaintiffs, saying that "we uncovered evidence that the reason the pentagram hadn't been approved was straightforward religious bias.... The Justice Department knew that if they didn't do the right thing, then a federal judge would tell them to and, in the process, would state very publicly all the things they've done wrong over the past decade."&lt;ref name="cemetery"/&gt;

The first "interfaith" headstone—including a [[Wicca]]n [[Pentacle]] for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a [[Christian Cross]] for her husband—was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=military&amp;id=11868 www.witchvox.com].

==Controversies==

===Flag folding===
[[File:USAF Honor Guard flag folding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|USAF personnel follow the traditional steps of folding the [[American flag]] during a ceremony at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany]]
Although no symbol incorporated into the design of the American flag has ever officially been given religious meaning by the United States government, there is a military ceremony of folding the flag into a triangle&lt;ref name="flaghistory"&gt;[http://usflagsupply.com/pages/FlagInfo.htm usflagsupply.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531041737/http://www.usflagsupply.com/pages/FlagInfo.htm# |date=2011-05-31 }}.

Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origin of the tradition or the words that accompany it is uncertain, although it is believed that it most likely began during World War I "when patriotism was high and the United States Flag was universally embraced as a national symbol".&lt;ref name="flaghistory"/&gt;

Over the years, various "scripts" have been developed for such ceremonies, to be read at each step of the folding, and some of these have linked the flag to religion in general or to a specific religious faith group in particular.&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt; Because such scripts can give the impression that either Congress or the military (or a specific branch of the military) had assigned a specific religious significance to the military tradition of folding the flag, military efforts have been made to ensure that any words recited during the ceremony avoid giving such an impression.&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt; So, for example, the Air Force issued an official flag folding script in 2006 which ends with these words:
{{quote|Since 1776 no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom... Today's Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us, for generations to come.

By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag, and express our gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their responsibility ... our responsibility ... to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today.

The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy, as a beacon of hope to one and all. Long may it wave."&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt;}}

Air Force Instruction 34-1201 includes the following guidance:
{{quote|The Air Force developed a script which provides an historical perspective on the flag. There are no ceremonies
in the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag is folded. However, when a flag folding ceremony is
desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script is the only one which may be used. This includes printing in programs and/or any handouts."&lt;ref name="AFI 34-1201"/&gt;}}

The Veterans Administration has published guidance that the reading of religious words to accompany the folding of the flags at burials within V.A. cemeteries will be allowed when requested by the family of the deceased.&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;[http://www.legion.org/flag/folding www.legion.org].

In the Fall of 2007, when complaints were made that dipping the flag toward a religious altar was inappropriate, then-academy Superintendent Vice Admiral [[Jeffrey Fowler]] directed that the practice be discontinued.&lt;ref name="dipping"/&gt; However, after some controversy, the practice was reinstated.&lt;ref name="dipping"/&gt;

===Bible verses on weapons===

United States military leaders reacted with surprise, expressing concern based on the fact that "U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious 'Crusade' in its war against [[Al-Qaeda|al Qaeda]] and Iraqi insurgents."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Defense Department photos revealed that the rifles that included the verses were being used by Iraqi forces that included Muslims who had no knowledge of the Christian Bible verses on the sights.&lt;ref name="rifles3"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-01-19-Military-weapons_N.htm www.usatoday.com, January 20, 2010].

For a number of reasons, including the fact that "one Bible does not fit all", and different chaplains and religious communities preferred different versions of the Bible, such items are no longer printed by the GPO, but "instead publishers may apply for a national stock number their items and chaplains can order the supplies they wish to use or have on hand for distribution to their service members."&lt;ref name="laing"/&gt; Through this process, "there are numerous versions of the Bible available for order through official channels with government funds."&lt;ref name="laing"/&gt;

However, while many groups work to provide Bibles for the military, sometimes promoting their relationships with retired or active duty chaplains, the actual use of military symbols—the emblem of the Department of Defense or emblems for one or more branches of the military—on Bibles available for purchase became a source of controversy in 2005.&lt;ref name="tradocbible"&gt;[http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/tnsarchives/August05/082405.htm www.tradoc.army.mil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051220/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/tnsarchives/August05/082405.htm# |date=2012-03-20 }}.

According to news reports, the army’s position is that official military symbols can only be used with the permission of "The Institute of Heraldry", which authorizes usage on publications of "an official or quasi-official nature."&lt;ref name="holmans"&gt;[http://kenanderson.net/bible/html/military_bible.html kenanderson.net].

However, [[National Public Radio]] published an article in its on-line edition, written by Jeff Brady and entitled "’The Soldier’s Bible’ draws fire," which said that the emblems make the Bibles appear to be "official government publications."&lt;ref name="tradoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nprbible"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4772331 www.npr.org].

Gunhus]], United States Army, Rear Admiral [[Barry C. Black]], United States Navy, and [[Lorraine K. Potter]], United States Air Force—that letter notes that "Department of Defense chaplains represent the American landscape of faith groups and religious communities," and that because the Bible is both "the most influential book in all human history" and "for many a constant companion to aid in directing one's life":

====Revocation of permission to use military emblems on Bibles====
June 2012 news sources announced that permission granted to use military emblems on Bibles had been revoked, with publishers notified in 2011 that the decision was made based on new military trademark licensing issues.&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/group-calls-military-bibles-threat-to-national-security.html# |title=Radio.foxnews.com, June 12, 2012 |access-date=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616003800/http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/group-calls-military-bibles-threat-to-national-security.html# |archive-date=2012-06-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One navy spokesman quoted in a Fox News online report stated that the decision was a "trademark issue," and "not a matter of religion."&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"/&gt; Additionally, the Department of Defense announced that all Bibles with military emblems must be removed from military stores.&lt;ref name="citizenlinkbibles"&gt;[http://www.citizenlink.com/2012/06/14/defense-department-yanks-bibles-with-military-service-insignias-from-shelves citizenlink.com, June 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Religious Freedom Foundation had threatened to sue the government if permission to use military emblems on Bibles was not revoked, noting that the Bibles were both an "unconstitutional government endorsement of religion" and a "national security threat."&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="citizenlinkbibles"/&gt;

===Prayer coins and military emblems===
The use of military emblems on "prayer coins" created by the "American Defenders of Freedom" (ADOF), distributed at no charge to military chaplains only if the chaplains clearly indicate on the order forms "how tracts/coins will be used for evangelism"
is another example of a controversy regarding military symbols and religious materials.&lt;ref name="coins"&gt;[http://pubrecord.org/religion/847/army-chief-of-chaplains-promotes-ministry-that-called-navy-secretary-satanic/ pubrecord.org].

Retrieved June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ADOF materials state that: "To obtain our materials without charge the Chaplain must describe in his/her order how our materials will be used in an evangelism process to share the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Chaplains will be required to pay for Prayer Coins used for other than ministry purposes, such as awards, recognitions, remembrances, etc."&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt; Additionally, ADOF notes that "Prayer Tracts and Prayer Reminder Coins are provided without charge to Chaplains for evangelistic Christian Ministry to troops, sailors, airmen and marines. Coins may also be purchased for special uses other than ministry…"&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt;

While coins had the emblems of the army, navy, and air force until 2008, Secretary of the Navy [[Donald C. Winter]] withdrew Navy permission to use its seal, necessitating a redesign of the coins to include army and air force emblems—announced in ADOF's January 2008 newsletter with the following statement: ""The Navy Prayer Reminder Coin was completely re-designed (an improvement) because the Secretary of the Navy would not give permission to use the official Navy seal on the Navy Prayer Reminder Coin – Satan is always at work."&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt;

While most issues involving the military and religious apparel involve requests from service personnel for permission to wear apparel required by their own religions, in December 2001 air force Lieutenant Colonel [[Martha McSally]] (a graduate of the Air Force Academy, and then the highest-ranking female fighter pilot in the air force) sued the air force because of the policy that required female military personnel assigned to bases in Saudi Arabia to wear the Muslim [[abaya]], a "head-to-toe" robe, whenever they were off base.&lt;ref name="abaya"&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/legacy/new/1-292925-725903.php www.armytimes.com].

Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; McSally's suit alleged that "the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men."&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:

{{quote|In a "60 Minutes" interview broadcast on CBS on Jan. 20, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy: "I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male . . . [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife," she said. "I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt;}}

General [[Tommy Franks]], head of the United States [[United States Central Command|Central Command]], announced in 2002 that women would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be "encouraged" to do so as a show of respect for local customs.&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; Commenting on the change—which was strongly criticized by Saudi officials as both a violation of Islamic law and Saudi sovereignty—Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been "under review" before the lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a [[court martial]] if she did not comply and wear the abaya.&lt;ref name="relents"&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Pentagon-relents-on-Arabic-dress-policy-for-women-1078347.php www.seattlepi.com]. Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for "women diplomats" assigned to the United States Embassy in [[Riyadh]], who were actually encouraged not to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, "because they are representing the United States."&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; Embassy officials stated that "in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress."&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; According to these United States officials, "the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya.... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-24-mcsally.htm www.usatoday.com]. Retrieved July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Congress "approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them."&lt;ref name="hijab"&gt;[http://themoderatevoice.com/102140/should-our-servicewomen-in-afghanistan-have-to-wear-headscarves themoderatevoice.com]. Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a decade after the abaya requirement was rescinded in Saudi Arabia, "strong encouragement" to wear the [[hijab]], a female headscarf, was the military policy in force for female personnel stationed in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; Some female personnel wear it over their helmets and some chose to wear the scarves in place of their helmets.&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; According to McSally, "Some servicewomen have taken off the regulation helmet and worn just the scarf, even when on patrol outside, in their combat uniforms and body armor, M-4s slung over their shoulders. The more common practice is to wear the scarf under one’s helmet or around the neck, pulling it on as the servicewoman removes her [[Kevlar]] [[Kevlar helmet|helmet]] upon entering a village or building."&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt;

While the military defends the policy of encouragement to wear the hijab as a "sign of respect" to the local culture that ""can help promote greater trust and a fuller interaction with the local population," McSally, who retired from the air force as a colonel, said that "especially in combat settings," when a superior tells a military subordinate that a practice is encouraged, "the very mention of the practice creates pressure to comply."&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; In a February 18, 2011 op-ed in "The Washington Post," she said that the policy of encouraging women to wear the "Muslim headscarves" is "appeasement, not respect" and that "American servicewomen will continue to be viewed as second-class warriors if leaders push them to take up the customs of countries where women are second-class citizens."&lt;ref name="mcsally"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021802446.html www.washingtonpost.com]. Retrieved July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that "Top military leaders should issue guidance that U.S. servicewomen are not authorized to wear a Muslim headscarf while in their uniform conducting military duties. If they don't, Congress should intervene again, as they did on the abaya, and prohibit its wear."&lt;ref name="mcsally"/&gt;

==Chaplains as symbol==

The basic words "chaplain" and "chapel" are derived from an ancient story about symbols of religion and faith:

{{quote|The story is told about [[St. Martin of Tours]], a compassionate fourth century soldier, who encountered a shivering beggar on a cold winter night. Having no money in his purse, this soldier took off his cloak and slashed it with his sword to give half of it to the beggar. Later that night he saw a vision in which Jesus Christ was wearing the half-cloak. As a result of this experience he became a Christian and was baptized. Ultimately he left the army to devote his life to the church. In time he became the [[patron saint]] of the French kings of the Middle Ages. St. Martin's cloak (cappella) was carried into battle by the kings as a banner signifying "the presence of God." But since the cappella was a sacred [[relic]] of the church, a priest went along as custodian. This keeper of the cloak, or cappellanus, also tended the king's religious needs, and from his office was derived that of "chaplain." The depository for the cloak became the 'chapel,' the place of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iphc.org/chaplaincy/etymology-word-chaplain www.iphc.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055258/http://www.iphc.org/chaplaincy/etymology-word-chaplain# |date=2011-09-28 }}. Retrieved July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chaplains no longer guard a "relic" like St. Martin's cloak, but they themselves have been called symbols of service, faith, hope, and cooperation across faith lines, and even reminders of "the presence of God" in stories such as that of the "[[Four Chaplains]]" (sometimes referred to as the "Immortal Chaplains")&lt;ref&gt;[http://immortalchaplains.org/home.htm Immortal Chaplains website].

Retrieved May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; That story, told in print, art, and film has become a symbol of "interfaith in action," the phrase used by the Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation, and included on the 1948 postage stamp dedicated to their memory.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; [[Vassar College]] professor [[Deborah Dash Moore]] has referred to the story of the Four Chaplains by saying that "The symbolism of their deaths exemplified faith confronting diversity, the triumph of cooperation over religious competition, the ultimate sacrifice by officers for their men, the power of duty over death."&lt;ref name="ddm"&gt;Moore, Deborah Dash, "Worshipping together in uniform: Christians and Jews in World War II," The 2001 Swig Lecture, University of San Francisco, September 13, 2001, from a reprint published by the Swig Judaic Studies Program, University of San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Toronto]] professor Doris L. Bergen has written that because of the "chaos and terror" encountered during military service, the chaplain becomes "a symbol that somehow, even in the midst of death and fear, there is meaning," and a symbol of the ability to maintain "courage, hope, and steadfastness in the face of alienation and destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Doris L., "The Sword of the Lord: Military chaplains from the first to the twenty-first century," University of Notre Dame Press, 2010, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains that was included in the 2003 edition of the American Bible Society's "Armed Forces Bible," chaplains are "a visible reminder of the Holy."&lt;ref name ="armedforcesbible2"&gt;American Bible Society Good News Translation, Armed Forces Bible, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an August 2011 Washington Post "Guest Voice" op-ed noted that:

{{quote|In both religion and the military, symbols carry powerful messages. For generations our armed forces chaplains, spiritual leaders in military uniforms, have themselves served as symbols: symbols of faith during times of chaos; of hope during times of despair; and of dreams during times of nightmares.

Retrieved August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For both military personnel and civilians, the work of chaplains became a symbol of cooperation that crossed many lines, including racial lines at a time when such cooperation was considered noteworthy (and even newsworthy) in the civilian community—as evidenced by a 1943 newsreel of Army Chaplain School training (then at [[Harvard University]]) which featured captions such as "White and Negro chaplains come out of the school building and march," and "White and Negro Chaplains perform a drill at Harvard University Chaplain School in Cambridge, Massachusetts."&lt;ref name="whiteandnegro"&gt;[http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675022031_Harvard-University_Chaplain-school_performing-a-drill_come-out-of-school www.criticalpast.com]. Retrieved July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have noted that interfaith cooperation among chaplains in the military led to improved interfaith relations in America—to the point that, at least according to some, it actually "transformed religion in America in the postwar period"&lt;ref name="ddm"/&gt;
Civilian communities felt the impact where former chaplains left the military to take positions at civilian houses of worship, but even where that did not happen, citizens were affected by the stories of military personnel and their chaplains, which became symbols of both cooperation across faith lines and faith in the face of adversity.&lt;ref name="ddm"/&gt; Additionally, the military chaplain became a symbol in some religious communities (such as the Jewish community) for the kind of spiritual leader its members desired for themselves:
[[File:Reagan Speech Beirut Bombing.ogv|thumb|right|200px|President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s keynote speech to the Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]]'s "Baptist Fundamentalism '84" convention: the story of chaplains as "symbols of faith" in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|1983 Beirut barracks bombing]].]]

{{quote|Rabbi [[Wolfe Kelman]] has asserted that a whole generation of American Jews that served during World War II saw in the Jewish chaplain the model for rabbinic function, and in the all-inclusive Jewish chapel program the model for synagogue function, for post-war America. When they moved into the suburbs and left behind the complex of communal service agencies that had served them in the older Jewish neighborhoods, they carried with them a clear idea of what kind of synagogue they needed and what kind of rabbi they wanted to lead them in the enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kollin, Gilbert, "The impact of the military chaplaincy on the American Rabbinate: 1861–1976," published in Rosenthal, Gilbert (editor), "The American Rabbi," KTAV Publishing House, 1977."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When President Reagan quoted the words that the service of chaplains during and after the 1983 Beirut bombing symbolized that "we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain," that speech was one of many that saw the presence of military chaplains as both a symbol of faith and a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt; In the words of that report:

{{quote|To understand the role of the chaplain...is to understand that we try to remind others, and perhaps ourselves as well, to cling to our humanity even in the worst of times. We bring with us the wisdom of men and women whose faith has kept alive their dreams in ages past. We bring with us the images of what the world could be, of what we ourselves might be, drawn from the visions of prophets and the promises of our holy books. We bring with us the truth that faith not only reminds us of the holy in heaven, but also of the holiness we can create here on Earth. It brings not only a message of what is divine, but also of what it means to be truly human. It's too easy to give in to despair in a world sometimes seemingly filled with cruelty and brutality. But we must remember not just the depths to which humans might sink, but also the heights to which they may aspire.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt;}}

'''''Rot op met je religie''''' (English: ''To Hell With Your Religion'') is a 2017 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television series by the [[Evangelische Omroep]], presented by Kefah Allush.

== Setting and purpose ==
In this [[Reality television|reality show]], four [[religion|religious people]] (two [[Christianity|Christians]], a [[Islam|Muslim]] and a [[Judaism|Jew]]) and two [[atheism|atheists]] live together in the same house in [[Haarlem]], and discuss and debate their religious beliefs, practices and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LJvru7g4U |title=De Nieuwe Maan - Rot op met je religie |work=De Nieuwe Maan |publisher=[[Omroep NTR|NTR]] |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features mutual [[criticism of religion]] as well as [[interfaith dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/rot-op-met-je-religie/ |title=Rot op met je religie |author=Thimo den Hartog |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants also travel across the Netherlands to visit [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], an [[abortion clinic]] and a [[Dhabihah|halal]] [[slaughterhouse]] amongst other places, and cook together despite their widely varying ethical views on food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/rtv/26697584/__EO__Rot_op_met_je_geloof__.html |title=EO: Rot op met je geloof |author=Marcel Frost |work=[[De Telegraaf]] |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/ |title=De ultieme religiestress-test in ‘Rot op met je religie’ op NPO2 |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EO hopes the programme will show what 'religious stress'&lt;ref&gt;The neologism ''religiestress'' ("religious stress") was coined in 2012 by Dutch theologian Tom Mikkers, who works for the EO.&lt;/ref&gt; does to the candidates, and what effect this has on their beliefs. Just before the first episode was broadcast, the EO published a survey about religious stress amongst Dutch citizens, which showed amongst other things that 93% of the population is in favour of [[freedom of speech]], and 82% supports [[freedom of religion]], but almost half think that [[secularism|religion should not be professed in public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rd.nl/kerk-religie/eo-nederlanders-ervaren-dilemma-s-rond-religie-1.1365904 |title=EO: Nederlanders ervaren dilemma’s rond religie |work=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the EO made similar programmes about [[refugee]]s (''Rot op naar je eigen land'', "Piss Off To Your Own Country", 2015) and [[environmental issue]]s (''[[Rot op met je milieu]]'', "Get Lost With Your Environment", 2016).&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/televisie/een-hoop-pleuris-en-religiestress-in-rot-op-met-je-religie~a4450288/ |title=Een hoop pleuris en religiestress in 'Rot op met je religie' |author=Gidi Heesakkers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Stichting KijkOnderzoek, a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings tracking]] service, reported that about 531,000 people watched the first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nieuwwij.nl/nieuws/ruim-half-miljoen-kijkers-rot-op-religie/ |title=Ruim half miljoen kijkers voor 'Rot op met je religie' |work=NieuwWij.nl |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', the EO used the programme to deliberately fan the flames of religious stress, and by their selection of participants created an unfair representation of the various worldviews: "The [[casting]] wants us to primarily look for reasonableness amongst the four religious participants (...). Even the two non-believers clash occasionally, because one is [[veganism|vegan]] and the other finds that to be politically correct bullshit. In short: in the first episode, the religious stress isn't quite fairly distributed yet between the followers of [[God]] and those who reject the existence of the fairytale character of god."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/17/de-eo-stookt-de-religiestress-nog-op-6246021-a1541592 |title=De EO stookt de religiestress verder op |author=Hans Beerekamp |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three episodes, ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', too, concluded that "the EO does everything within their power to let all hell break loose. There is no live and let live." Just like in the previous ''Rot op'' series, the programme would primarily be "about confrontation, heated discussions and perhaps a vain hope of reconciliation." It noted that the most fierce nonbeliever, Floris, "is portrayed the least sympathetic by the montage so far." On the preview of the fourth episode, in which Safeer shows his unease when meeting a [[Islam and homosexuality|gay Muslim]], the newspaper's reviewer (referencing [[Genesis 1:4]]) commented: "Someone saw the announcement, and saw it was not good. ''Stress!''"
&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"/&gt;

A critic from ThePostOnline disagreed with the ''Volkskrant'''s criticism of the montage: "By definition, media select that which is appetising." On the contrary, 'sensational television' is interesting, especially to discover who 'understands the art of living and tolerance best'. In his opinion, the atheist and vegan Floris, "whose raised voice against his religious fellow man may go into Dutch television history as legendary", drawing the comparison to the late politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], finishes last in this regard, followed by the imam Safeer, whilst sympathy for the atheist Bryan is growing throughout the series, and the Jewish Sheila has had the audience's sympathy from the beginning. Furthermore, the EO allegedly lacked a sense of humour, and the idea of 'let it be' would only rarely feature in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.tpo.nl/2017/01/19/rot-op-religie-minder-minder-minder-veganisten/ |title=Rot op met je religie: Minder, minder, minder veganisten |author=Peter Olsthoorn |work=ThePostOnline |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred architecture''' (also known as '''religious architecture''') is a [[religion|religious]] [[architecture|architectural]] practice concerned with the design and construction of [[place of worship|places of worship]] or sacred or intentional space, such as [[Church architecture|churches]], [[Mosque#Architecture|mosques]], [[stupa]]s, [[synagogue architecture|synagogues]], and [[temple]]s. Many cultures devoted considerable resources to their sacred architecture and places of worship. Religious and sacred spaces are amongst the most impressive and permanent [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] [[building]]s created by humanity. Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.

Sacred, religious and holy structures often evolved over centuries and were the largest buildings in the world, prior to the modern skyscraper. While the various styles employed in sacred architecture sometimes reflected trends in other structures, these styles also remained unique from the contemporary architecture used in other structures. With the rise of [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[monotheism]]s (particularly [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), religious buildings increasingly became centres of [[worship]], [[prayer]] and [[meditation]].

The Western scholarly discipline of the [[history of architecture]] itself closely follows the history of religious architecture from ancient times until the [[Baroque period]], at least. [[Sacred geometry]], [[iconography]], and the use of sophisticated [[semiotics]] such as signs, symbols and religious motifs are endemic to sacred architecture.

== Spiritual aspects of religious architecture ==

[[File:Orthodox-Church-interior.jpg|left|thumb|An illustrated layout of the traditional interior of a [[Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox church]].]]

Sacred or religious architecture is sometimes called sacred space.

Architect Norman L. Koonce has suggested that the goal of sacred architecture is to make "transparent the boundary between matter and mind, flesh and the spirit." In discussing sacred architecture, Protestant minister [[Robert Schuller]] suggested that "to be psychologically healthy, human beings need to experience their natural setting—the setting we were designed for, which is the garden." Meanwhile, [[Richard Kieckhefer]] suggests that entering into a religious building is a metaphor for entering into spiritual relationship. Kieckhefer suggests that sacred space can be analyzed by three factors affecting spiritual process: longitudinal space emphasizes the procession and return of sacramental acts, auditorium space is suggestive of proclamation and response, and new forms of communal space designed for gathering and return depend to a great degree on minimized scale to enhance intimacy and participation in worship.

== Ancient architecture ==

[[File:Karnak Temple Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the ancient Egyptian [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]].]]

Sacred architecture spans a number of ancient architectural styles including [[Neolithic architecture]], [[ancient Egyptian architecture]] and [[Sumerian architecture]]. Ancient religious buildings, particularly temples, were often viewed as the dwelling place, the ''[[temenos]]'',  of the gods and were used as the site of various kinds of sacrifice. Ancient tombs and burial structures are also examples of architectural structures reflecting religious beliefs of their various societies. The [[Temple of Karnak]] at Thebes, Egypt was constructed across a period of 1300 years and its numerous temples comprise what may be the largest religious structure ever built. Ancient Egyptian religious architecture has fascinated archaeologists and captured the public imagination for millennia.

== Classical architecture ==

[[File:ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]

Around 600 BCE the wooden columns of the Temple of Hera at Olympia were replaced by stone columns. With the spread of this process to other sanctuary structures a few stone buildings have survived through the ages. Greek architecture preceded Hellenistic and Roman periods (Roman architecture heavily copied Greek). Since temples are the only buildings which survive in numbers, most of our concept of classical architecture is based on religious structures. The [[Parthenon]] which served as a treasury building as well as a place for veneration of deity, is widely regarded as the greatest example of classical architecture.

== Indian architecture ==

[[Indian architecture]] is related to the history and religions of the time periods as well as to the geography and geology of the Indian subcontinent. India was crisscrossed by trading routes of merchants from as far away as [[Siraf]] and [[China]] as well as weathering invasions by foreigners, resulting in multiple influences of foreign elements on native styles.  The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. Indian architecture comprises a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]].

=== Buddhism ===

{{see also|Buddhist architecture|stupa}}

[[Buddhist architecture]] developed in [[South Asia]] beginning in the third century BCE. Two types of structures are associated with early [[Buddhism]]: [[viharas]] and [[stupas]].
Originally, Viharas were temporary shelters used by wandering monks during the rainy season, but these structures later developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalized Buddhist [[monasticism]]. An existing example is at [[Nalanda]] ([[Bihar]]).

The initial function of the stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into [[chaitya]]-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora]] ([[Maharashtra]]).

The [[pagoda]] is an evolution of the Indian stupa that is marked by a tiered [[tower]] with multiple [[eaves]] common in China, Japan, Korea, Nepal and other parts of Asia.
[[Buddhist temple]]s were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[Bihar]]. The architectural structure of the stupa spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions were incorporated into the overall design. It was spread to China and the Asian region by [[Araniko]], a [[Nepal]]i architect in the early 13th century for [[Kublai Khan]].

===Hinduism===

[[File:Brihadeshwara front right.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]], Tanjavur, built in the Dravida style]] 
[[Hindu temple architecture]] is based on ''[[Sthapatya Veda]]'' and many other ancient religious texts like the ''[[Brihat Samhita]]'', ''[[Vastu Shastra]]'' and ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' in accordance to the design principles and guidelines believed to have been laid by the divine architect [[Vishvakarma]]. It evolved over a period of more than 2000 years. The Hindu architecture conforms to strict religious models that incorporate elements of [[astronomy]] and [[sacred geometry]]. In Hindu belief, the [[temple]] represents the [[macrocosm]] of the universe as well as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of inner space. While the underlying form of Hindu temple architecture follows strict traditions, considerable variation occurs with the often intense decorative embellishments and ornamentation.

A basic [[Hindu]] [[temple]] consists of an inner sanctum, the ''[[garbhagriha]]'' or womb-chamber, a congregation hall, and possibly an antechamber and porch. The sanctum is crowned by a tower-like ''[[shikhara]]''. The [[Hindu temple]] represents Mount Meru, the axis  of the universe. There are strict rules which describe the themes and sculptures on the outer walls of the temple buildings.

The two primary styles that have developed are the [[Nagara]] style of Northern India and the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravida]] style of Southern India. A prominent difference between the two styles are the elaborate gateways employed in the South. They are also easily distinguishable by the shape and decoration of their shikharas. The Nagara style is beehive-shaped while the Dravida style is pyramid-shaped.

==Byzantine architecture==

[[File:Ani.mosque.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ruins of Menüçehr Camii near Kars, Turkey, believed to be the oldest [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] mosque in [[Anatolia]]]]
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architecture evolved from Roman architecture. Eventually, a style emerged incorporating Near East influences and the Greek cross plan for church design. In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected. One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of squinches or pendentives. The prime example of early Byzantine religious architecture is the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul.

==Islam==
{{see also|Islamic architecture}}
Byzantine architecture had a great influence on early Islamic architecture with its characteristic round arches, vaults and domes. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable mosque types include the early [[Abbasid]] mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]].

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], a hypostyle mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern, in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]]]]
The earliest styles in Islamic architecture produced ''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques during the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques follow a square or rectangular plan with enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat prayer hall roofs, which required numerous [[column]]s and [[support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers |issn=1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]] was constructed as a hypostyle mosque supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab-plan mosques continued under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century that have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, in areas where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque in Jerusalem is perhaps the best known example of a central dome mosque.

''Iwan mosques'' are most notable for their domed chambers and ''[[iwan]]s'', which are vaulted spaces open out on one end. In ''iwan'' mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style represents a borrowing from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture and has been used almost exclusively for mosques in [[Iran]]. Many ''iwan'' mosques are converted [[Zoroastrism|Zoroastrian]] fire temples where the courtyard was used to house the sacred fire.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt; Today, iwan mosques are no longer built.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"/&gt; The [[Shah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]] is a classic example of an ''iwan'' mosque.
[[File:Mosque of Uqba minaret.jpg|right|thumb|View of the square three-tiered minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba]] (Great Mosque of Kairouan); this mosque, founded in 670, is one of the most impressive mosques in North Africa, situated in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]]]

A common feature in mosques is the [[minaret]], the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church (building)|churches]] with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose &amp;mdash; calling the faithful to prayer.&lt;ref name="Manara"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J.

Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Manara, Manar | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domes have been a hallmark of [[Islamic architecture]] since the 7th century. As time progressed, the sizes of mosque domes grew, from occupying only a small part of the roof near the [[mihrab]] to encompassing all of the roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in India popularized onion-shaped domes in [[South Asia]] and [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=1992-09-24 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=|chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style |page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer hall, also known as the musalla, has no furniture; chairs and pews are absent from the prayer hall.&lt;ref name="unitulsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230180348/http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |archivedate=December 30, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer halls contain no images of people, animals, and spiritual figures although they may be decorated with [[Arabic calligraphy]] and verses from the [[Qur'an]] on the walls.

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''[[qibla]] wall'', which is the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The ''qibla'' wall is normally set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=1998-12-16 |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |ISBN=|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregants pray in rows parallel to the ''qibla'' wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the ''qibla'' wall, usually at its center, is the [[mihrab]], a niche or depression indicating the ''qibla'' wall. Usually the ''mihrab'' is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during [[Friday prayer]]s, a raised [[minbar]] or pulpit is located to the side of the ''mihrab'' for a [[khatib]] or some other speaker to offer a sermon ([[khutbah]]). The mihrab serves as the location where the [[imam]] leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosques often have [[wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"/&gt; Modern mosques may have a variety of amenities available to their congregants and the community, such as  [[clinic|health clinics]], [[library|libraries]] and [[gym]]nasiums.

==Medieval architecture==

{{see also|medieval architecture}}
{{see also|Church architecture}}
{{see also|Cathedral architecture}}
The religious architecture of Christian churches in the Middle Ages featured the [[Latin cross]] plan, which takes the Roman [[Basilica]] as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a [[nave]], [[transept]]s, and the [[altar]] stands at the east end (see ''[[Cathedral diagram]]''). Also, [[cathedral]]s influenced or commissioned by [[Justinian I|Justinian]] employed the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] of domes and a [[Greek cross]] (resembling a plus sign), centering attention on the altar at the ''center'' of the church. The [[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] is an excellent example of Russian orthodox architecture in the Middle Ages. The [[Urnes stave church]] (Urnes stavkyrkje) in [[Norway]] is a superb example of a medieval stave church.

==Gothic architecture==
[[File:Chartres 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chartres Cathedral]]]]
{{see also|Gothic architecture}}
[[Gothic architecture]] was particularly associated with cathedrals and other churches, which flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. Beginning in 12th century France, it was known as "the French Style" during the period. The style originated at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrUQclzjlIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=gothic+originated+saint+denis&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=dD7aTqOVBs2ZhQedteHPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=gothic%20originated%20saint%20denis&amp;f=false Andrzej Piotrowski (2011), ''Architecture of Thought'', U of Minnesota Press, p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable gothic religious structures include [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], and the [[Chartres Cathedral]].

==Renaissance architecture==
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|left|The Basilica of Saint Peter, Rome]]
{{see also|Renaissance architecture}}
The Renaissance brought a return of classical influence and a new emphasis on rational clarity. Renaissance architecture represents a conscious revival of Roman Architecture with its symmetry, mathematical proportions, and geometric order. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s plan for the [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] as the dome of the Florence Cathedral in 1418 was one of the first important religious architectural designs of the Italian renaissance.

==Baroque architecture==
[[File:Santa Susanna (Rome) - facade.jpg|thumb|upright|Baroque façade of Santa Susanna, by [[Carlo Maderno]]]]
{{see also|baroque architecture}}
Evolving from the renaissance style, the [[baroque]] style was most notably experienced in religious art and architecture. Most architectural historians regard [[Michelangelo]]'s design of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]] as a precursor to the Baroque style. Baroque style can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection. The most important early example of the baroque period was the [[Santa Susanna]] by [[Carlo Maderno]]. [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] by [[Christopher Wren]] is regarded as the prime example of the rather late influence of the Baroque style in England.

==Mormon temples==
[[File:Temple Square October 05 (8) c.JPG|thumb|left|[[Salt Lake Temple]]]]
{{main|Temple architecture (Latter-day Saints)}}
[[Temple (LDS Church)|Temples]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] offer a unique look at design as it has changed from the simple church like structure of the [[Kirtland Temple]] built in the 1830s, to the [[castellated]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] styles of the early [[Utah]] temples, to the dozens of modern temples built today.  
Early temples, and some modern temples, have a priesthood assembly room with two sets of pulpits at each end of the room, with chairs or benches that can be altered to face either way.  Most, but not all temples have the recognizable statue of the [[Angel Moroni]] atop a spire.  The [[Nauvoo Temple]] and the [[Salt Lake Temple]] are adorned with symbolic stonework, representing various aspects of the faith.

==Modern and post-modern architectures==
[[File:IndependenceTemple2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Community of Christ Temple in Independence, Missouri, USA is postmodern in design.]] 
{{see also|Modern architecture|Postmodern architecture}}
[[Modern architecture]] spans several styles with similar characteristics resulting in simplification of form and the elimination of ornament. The most influential modernist architects in the early to mid 20th century include [[Dominikus Böhm]], [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]], and [[Auguste Perret]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven J. Schloeder]], ''Architecture in Communion: Implementing the Second Vatican Council through Liturgy and Architecture.'' (Ignatius Press: 1998): 23-24 and 234-38. {{ISBN|0-89870-631-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While secular structures clearly had the greater influence on the development of modern architecture, several excellent examples of modern architecture can be found in religious buildings of the 20th century. For example, [[Unity Temple]] in Chicago is a [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The [[United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel]], started in 1954 and completed in 1962, was designed by [[Walter Netsch]] and is an excellent example of modern religious architecture. It has been described as a "phalanx of fighters" turned on their tails and pointing heavenward. In 1967, Architect [[Pietro Belluschi]] designed the strikingly modern [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption]] (San Francisco), the first Catholic cathedral in the United States intended to conform to [[Vatican II]].

Post-modern architecture may be described by unapologetically diverse aesthetics where styles collide, form exists for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. [[Independence Temple|The Temple]] at Independence, Missouri was conceived by Japanese architect [[Gyo Obata]] after the concept of the chambered nautilus. The Catholic [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] (Los Angeles) was designed in 1998 by [[Jose Rafael Moneo]] in a post-modern style. The structure evokes the area's Hispanic heritage through the use of adobe coloring while combining stark modern form with some traditional elements. The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]] on the other hand is a much more traditional edifice. Designed by [[Barbara Bielecka]] and built between 1994 and 2004, its form includes references to a number of Polish structures. The columns possess a slenderness and delicacy inspired by those of the Renaissance court of [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]], while the huge 420-foot spire that will be erected next to the basilica bears more than an accidental resemblance to the Baroque spire that adorns the [[Jasna Gora]] monastery of [[Czestochowa]], home of the [[Black Madonna]].

'''Scythian religion''' refers to the mythology, ritual practices and beliefs of the [[Scythians]], an ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]] who dominated [[Central Asia]] and the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] in [[Eastern Europe]] throughout [[Classical Antiquity]]. What little is known of the religion is drawn from the work of the 5th century Greek historian and ethnographer [[Herodotus]]. Scythian religion is assumed to have been related to the earlier [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], and to have influenced later [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], [[Hungarian mythology|Hungarian]] and [[Turkic mythology|Turkic]] mythologies, as well as some contemporary [[Eastern Iranian]] and [[Ossetian mythology|Ossetian]] traditions. 

==Archaeological context==

The primary archaeological context of [[horse sacrifice]] are burials, notably [[chariot burial]]s, but graves with horse remains reach from the [[Eneolithic]] well into historical times. [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of horses at the burial of a [[Scythian]] king, and Iron Age [[kurgan]] graves known to contain horses number in the hundreds.

The [[Scythian]]s had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in their artwork, especially at funeral sites (see, for example, the [[Pazyryk burials]]). 

==Pantheon==

According to [[Herodotus]], the Scythians worshipped a pantheon of seven gods and goddesses (heptad), which he equates with [[Greek mythology|Greek divinities]] of Classical Antiquity following the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''. He mentions eight deities in particular, the eighth being worshipped by the Royal Scythians, and gives the [[Scythian languages|Scythian names]] for seven of them as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay (1904:314). Cf. also Rolle (1980:128–129); Hort (1827:188–190).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Scythian Ares''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ἄρης'') – [[Ares]]
*'''Tabiti''' (''Ταβιτί'') – [[Hestia]]
*'''Papaios''' (''Παπαῖος'') – [[Zeus]]
*'''Api''' (''Ἀπί'') – [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]
*'''Oitosyros''' (''Οἰτόσυρος'') – [[Apollo]]
*'''Argimpasa''' (''Ἀργίμπασα'') – [[Aphrodite Urania]]
*'''Thagimasidas''' (''Θαγιμασάδας'') – [[Poseidon]]

==Animal sacrifice==

The mode of Scythian [[animal sacrifice]] was, in the opinion of Herodotus, relatively simple. Sacrificial animals included various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:315"&gt;Macaulay (1904:315).&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:

{{quote|The victim stands with its fore-feet tied, and the sacrificing priest stands behind the victim, and by pulling the end of the cord he throws the beast down; and as the victim falls, he calls upon the god to whom he is sacrificing, and then at once throws a noose round its neck, and putting a small stick into it he turns it round and so strangles the animal, without either lighting a fire or making any first offering from the victim or pouring any libation over it: and when he has strangled it and flayed off the skin, he proceeds to boil it. [...] Then when the flesh is boiled, the sacrificer takes a first offering of the flesh and of the vital organs and casts it in front of him.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:314"&gt;Macaulay (1904:314).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Worship of "Scythian Ares"==

Although Tabiti was apparently the most important deity in the Scythian pantheon, the worship accorded to the deity Herodotus refers to as "Ares" was unique. He notes that "it is not their custom [...] to make images, altars or temples to any except Ares, but to him it is their custom to make them".&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:314"/&gt; He describes the construction of the altar and the subsequent sacrifice as follows:

{{quote|In each district of the several governments they have a temple of Ares set up in this way: bundles of brushwood are heaped up for about three furlongs in length and in breadth, but less in height; and on the top of this there is a level square made, and three of the sides rise sheer but by the remaining one side the pile may be ascended. Every year they pile on a hundred and fifty wagon-loads of brushwood, for it is constantly settling down by reason of the weather. Upon this pile of which I speak each people has an ancient iron sword set up, and this is the sacred symbol of Ares. To this sword they bring yearly offerings of cattle and of horses; and they have the following sacrifice in addition, beyond what they make to the other gods, that is to say, of all the enemies whom they take captive in war they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not in the same manner as they sacrifice cattle, but in a different manner: for they first pour wine over their heads, and after that they cut the throats of the men, so that the blood runs into a bowl; and then they carry this up to the top of the pile of brushwood and pour the blood over the sword. This, I say, they carry up; and meanwhile below by the side of the temple they are doing thus: they cut off all the right arms of the slaughtered men with the hands and throw them up into the air, and then when they have finished offering the other victims, they go away; and the arm lies wheresoever it has chanced to fall, and the corpse apart from it.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:315"/&gt;}}

According to [[Tadeusz Sulimirski]], this form of worship continued among the descendants of the Scythians, the [[Alans]], through to the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Sulimirski (1985:158–159).&lt;/ref&gt;; this tradition may be reflected in [[Jordanes]]' assertion that [[Attila]] was able to assert his authority over the Scythians through his possession of the "Sword of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]"&lt;ref&gt;Geary (1994:63).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Enarei==
The ''[[Enarei]]'' were a privileged caste of hereditary priests which played an important political role in Scythian society as they were believed to have received the gift of prophesy directly from the goddess Argimpasa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Macaulay (1904:317); Christian (1998:148).&lt;/ref&gt; The method employed by the ''Enarei'' differed from that practised by traditional Scythian diviners: whereas the latter used a bundle of willow rods, the ''Enarei'' used strips cut from the bark of the linden tree (genus ''[[tilia]]'') to tell the future. The ''Enarei'' were also noted for [[crossdress|dressing themselves in the clothes of women]], a custom which Herodotus understands as being reflected in the title ''ena-rei'', glossing this as ''ἀνδρό-γυνοι'' or "man-women".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Sea of Faith Network''' ('''SoF''') is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote  religious faith as a human creation.

==History==
The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to [[Don Cupitt]]'s book and [[Sea of Faith (TV series)|television series]], both titled ''Sea of Faith''.&lt;ref name="Bill Cooke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Bill|title=Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst NY|isbn=978-1591022992|pages=470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA6_jqohqRUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, [[Anglican]] priest, and former Dean of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt: Life Fellow and former Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge, England|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/cupitt.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the  view that religion is simply a human creation.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Stangroom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stangroom|first1=Jeremy|last2=Baggini|first2=Julian|authorlink1=Jeremy Stangroom|authorlink2=Julian Baggini|title=What Philosophers Think|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-0826484741|pages=95–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6jT10cRPXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Sea of Faith is taken from [[Matthew Arnold]]'s nostalgic mid 19th century poem "[[Dover Beach]]", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the "sea of faith" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt sea of faith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupitt|first=Don|title=The Sea of Faith|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521344203|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCXcdgWck_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=don+cupitt+dover+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fLrsUL3zC6j22gWH_YGICw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988.&lt;ref name="Peter B. Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B.|title=Encyclopedia Of New Religious Movements|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415453837|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/Atheism_Agnosticism/sea_of_faith_network.php|work=That Religious Studies Website|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.&lt;ref name=sofn&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith Network] retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's magazine ''Sofia'' is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Beliefs==
SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to "explore and promote religious faith as a human creation".&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are|url=http://www.sofn.org.uk/sof/who_we_are.html|publisher=Sea of Faith Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are" /&gt;  Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see [[liberal Christianity]]) while others choose to call themselves [[religious humanism|religious]] or [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] (see [[humanism]]). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see [[Christian atheism]]).

SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Philosophy==
A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion.&lt;ref name="andrew moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar, and Meaning|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521524155|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AgRQ0QbZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cathey&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathey|first=Robert Andrew|title=God In Postliberal Perspective: Between Realism and Non-Realism|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington VT|isbn=978-0754616801|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkVppp6cfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the belief that God has no "real", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is "real" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion.&lt;ref name="peter mullen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullen|first=Peter|title=Faith and Reason Cupitt's arrows lie blunted by the reality of reasoned discussion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/faith-and-reason-cupitts-arrows-lie-blunted-by-the-reality-of-reasoned-discussion-1391036.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=31 Dec 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network|url=http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/sof/sea-of-faith-network.html|publisher=Faversham Stoa|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupitt wrote, "God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power".&lt;ref&gt;''Taking Leave of God'', Don Cupitt, SCM, 1980, 2001 edition: {{ISBN|0-334-02840-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cupitt calls this "a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity".&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt; It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.&lt;ref name="Gail Vines"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Gail|title=A Godless creed|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=99906&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=19 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's influence==
Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change.&lt;ref name="nigel leaves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaves|first=Nigel|title=Odyssey on the Sea of Faith: The Life &amp; Writings of Don Cupitt|year=2004|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa CA|isbn=978-0944344620|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early books such as ''Taking Leave of God'' and ''The Sea of Faith'' Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real,&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God|url=http://philosophybites.com/2008/11/don-cupitt-on-nonrealism-about-god.html|work=philosophy bites|publisher=Institute of Philosophy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1980s he moved into [[postmodernism]], describing his position as empty radical humanism:&lt;ref name="About Non-Realism"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Non-Realism|url=http://www.doncupitt.com/non-realism|publisher=Don Cupitt|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.&lt;ref name=hyman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyman|first=Gavin|title=The Predicament of Postmodern Theology: Radical Orthodoxy or Nihilist Textualism?|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville KY|isbn=978-0664223663|pages=44–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuXIL7amXvIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;  Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:BogdanKacmajor.jpg|thumb|Bogdan Kacmajor]] --&gt; 
The '''Sekta Niebo''' (Heaven Sect) ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Zbór Chrześcijański Leczenia Duchem Bożym''; "Christian Church of Healing by Spirit of God") was a small religious movement founded in 1990 by [[faith healer]] [[Bogdan Kacmajor]], who believed he was a prophet chosen by God and a reincarnation of the prophet [[Elijah]].

==Beliefs and practices==
Members of the sect believed that by the year 2000 the world would come to an end. Their goal was to establish a commune of chosen people. As a symbol of their new life they took new names and destroyed their identity documents. Total submission to Kacmajor was required. Members married each other, refused to send children to public school (as Kacmajor stated, "in chemistry class they teach that you can't turn water into wine, in physics class they teach that you can't walk on water") and refused to take any medical treatment (Kacmajor was convinced that he can heal even AIDS). Niebo gathered approximately 50 members.

==Decline==
Because of their total social alienation the group soon started to have troubles with the law. Reports of kidnapping and children being kept prisoner started circulating. The Catholic Church and several church-related movements started a campaign against the community which resulted in bad fame and financial problems. As of 2008 the community does not exist and there are several court cases against Kacmajor.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}

'''Sobo''' is a spirit or [[loa]] in the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. He is the spirit of thunder and is always depicted and served with his inseparable companion/brother [[Bade (loa)|Bade]], who is the spirit of wind. Together they are represented by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] image of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]]. He is probably [[West Africa]]n in origin and a flaming ram is his symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''Strixology''' is a genre of writing about the reality and dangers of [[witch]]es, their origins, character and power; often in the context of [[theology]] or of [[demonology]].{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 205}} (The Latin word ''strix'' can mean "screech-owl" or "witch".&lt;ref&gt;
[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strix See "strix" in Wiktionary.]
&lt;/ref&gt;)

During the [[early modern period]] strixologists refuted the reality of witches and contributed to the decline of [[witch-hunts]].{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=vii}}

As a systematic study, strixology emerged during the period 1431—1439 at the [[Council of Basel]] - an ecclesiastical council where [[theologians]] and [[demonologist]]s met and debated what was seen as the [[Devil]]'s work, [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]al observations and confessions of witches.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|pp=53-54}} Those issues were not a primary purpose of the Council. Nonetheless, the subject of one of the discussions was a peasant named [[Stedelen]] who was believed to have committed ''[[maleficia]]''{{efn|harmful acts of witchcraft}} and who said under torture that he was a part of a secret society of Devil-worshippers. This story was disturbing enough to be reported to the council by Peter of Simmental and described in great detail.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=54}}

This case and similar revelations were later used by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] professor [[Johannes Nider]], a participant at the Council's meetings, as examples in his ''[[Formicarius]]'' (1436-1438) a book that laid the foundations of strixology. Scholars cited this significant work for centuries.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|pp=54-55}} Around the time ''Formicarius'' was published, there was a relatively small number of witch-hunt victims - estimated to have been in the hundreds.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=56}} This changed at the end of the 15th century, partially due to the publication of the infamous ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' which cemented belief in the reality of witches{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 56}} and in the higher susceptibility of women to take part in witchcraft.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 57}} The book proclaimed that “evils which are performed by witches exceed all other sin which God has ever permitted to be done.…”.{{sfnb|Summers|1971|loc=[Part

{{Taoism}}
A '''Taoist priest''', '''Taoist monk''', '''Taoist master''' or '''Professional Taoist''' (道士 "master of the [[Tao]]") is a [[priest]] in [[Taoism]]. Some orders are [[monasticism|monastic]] (Quanzhen orders), while the majority are not (Zhengyi orders).

Some of the monastic orders are hermitic, and their members practice seclusion and [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyles in the mountains, with the aim of becoming ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'', or immortal beings. Non-monastic priests live among the populace and manage and serve their own temples or popular temples.

The activities of the Taoists tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the ''[[Daozang]]'', or Daoist Canon; however, Taoists generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.

==Orders==
Taoist orders are conventionally categorised into two main branches: Quanzhen and Zhengyi.

===Quanzhen Taoism===
[[Quanzhen Taoism]], which is present almost exclusively in the north of [[China]], includes all Taoist orders which have a monastic institution. Their lifestyle is comparable to that of the [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]s in that they are celibate, vegetarian, and live in monasteries. The [[White Cloud Temple]] in [[Beijing]] is the main monastery of the Longmen school of Quanzhen, and is also the main headquarters of mainland China's [[Chinese Taoist Association|official Taoist Church]].

===Zhengyi Taoism===
The other main priesthood is [[Zhengyi Taoism]], in which the priests can marry, eat meat, live in their own homes, and found and manage their own temples or serve in folk religious temples. They are mostly priests part-time and can hold other jobs. Their lineages are transmitted through training and ordination by another priest, although historically they received a formal confirmation in their role by the [[Celestial Master]], the highest priest. Fragmentation of the lineage of the Celestial Masters has made Zhengyi priests more independent. In mainland China the Taoist Church has in theory taken over the power to regulate them (although only a minority of them are registered with the Church). Zhengyi orders are present all over China, although with different names according to the local lineages. For example, in northern China there are the ''yinyang'' masters of the [[Lingbao Taoism|Lingbao]] sub-tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2007. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theistic evolution''', '''theistic evolutionism''', '''evolutionary creationism''' or '''God-guided evolution''' are views that regard religious teachings about [[God]] as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. Theistic evolution is not in itself a [[scientific theory]], but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.

Supporters of theistic evolution generally harmonize evolutionary thought with belief in God, rejecting the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}} they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EvC&gt;
''Evolution Vs. Creationism'', [[Eugenie Scott]], Niles Eldredge, p62-63
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

[[Francis Collins]] describes theistic evolution as the position that "evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God",&lt;ref name=collins-def&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1038/442110a|title= Building bridges|year= 2006|journal= Nature|volume= 442|issue= 7099|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characterizes it as accepting "that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God".&lt;ref&gt;Stipe, Claude E., "Scientific Creationism and Evangelical Christianity", ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 87, No. 1 (Mar., 1985), p. 149, Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/677678 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]] in the United States of America, [[Eugenie Scott]], has used the term to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the [[theology|theological]] view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching [[deism]] in rejecting the concept of continued intervention.

Just as different types of evolutionary explanations have evolved, so there are different types of theistic evolution. Creationists [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John D. Morris]], point out that there are different terms which have been used to describe different positions: ''"'''[[Orthogenesis]]"''' (goal-directed evolution), '''"[[Lev_Berg#Nomogenesis|nomogenesis]]"''' (evolution according to fixed law), '''"[[emergent evolution]]"''', '''"[[creative evolution (disambiguation)|creative evolution]]"''', and others''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Creation Trilogy'' (1998), New Leaf Publishing Group, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that one should read the creation story in the book of Genesis only metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last=Glover | first=Gordon J. | year=2007 | title=Beyond the Firmament: Understanding Science and the Theology of Creation | location= Chesapeake, VA| publisher=Watertree | isbn=0-9787186-1-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others see "evolutionary creation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/3EvoCr.htm|title=Evolutionary Creation|work=ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EC, also referred to by some observers as "evolutionary creationism") as the belief that God, as Creator, uses evolution to bring about his plan. The Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881-1955) was an influential proponent of God-directed evolution or "orthogenesis", in which man will eventually evolve to the "[[omega point]]" of union with the Creator.

==Historical development==
{{further|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

Historians of science (and authors of pre-evolutionary ideas) have pointed out that scientists had considered the concept of biological change well before Darwin.

In the 17th century, the English [[nonconformist]]/[[Anglican]] priest and botanist [[John Ray]], in his book ''The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692)'', had wondered "why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1960/JASA6-60Marsh.html On the Origins of New Forms of Life, A new Theory], by Eugene M. McCarthy.&lt;/ref&gt;

18th-century scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707-1778) published ''Systema Naturae'' (1735- ), a book in which he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of immutability of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it. Yet, as a Christian, he still defended "special creation", the belief that God created "every living creature" at the beginning, as read in Genesis, with the peculiarity a set of original species of which all the present species have descended.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last1= Garner |first1= Paul A. |chapter= 1: Evolving Christian Views of Species |editor1-last= Wood |editor1-first= Todd Charles |editor2-last=Garner |editor2-first=Paul A. |title= Genesis Kinds: Creationism and the Origin of Species |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8wpMAwAAQBAJ |series= Issues in creation |volume= Center for Origins Research Issues in Creation: 5 |issue= 5 |location= Eugene, Oregon|publisher= Wipf and Stock |publication-date= 2009-01-16 |page=16 |isbn=9781606084908 |quote=In his ''Disquisitio de Sexu Plantarum'' (1756), Linnaeus had argued that the genera were the original units of creation and that the species within them had originated by subsequent hybridization. In 1766, he dropped his famous maxim about the permanance of species from the final edition of the ''Systema Naturae''. Glass (1959b, p. 151) summarizes his mature views this way: 'In the end he believed in the evolution of the smaller systematic categories, of the species as he knew species, and maybe of the genera. But the original Creation was still that of a multitude of forms, distinct then and forever.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus wrote:
{{Quote|Let us suppose that the Divine Being in the beginning progressed from the simpler to the complex; from few to many; similarly that He in the beginning of the plant kingdom created as many plants as there were natural orders. These plant orders He Himself, there from producing, mixed among themselves until from them originated those plants which today exist as genera. Nature then mixed up these plant genera among themselves through generations -of double origin (hybrids) and multiplied them into existing species, as many as possible (whereby the flower structures were not changed) excluding from the number of species the almost sterile hybrids, which are produced by the same mode of origin.|''Systema Vegetabilium'' (1774)&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Cameron Crombie, Michael A. Hoskin (1988), ''"History of Science"'' Science History Publications. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaeus attributed the active process of biological change to God himself, as he stated:

{{Quote|We imagine that the Creator at the actual time of creation made only one single species for each natural order of plants, this species being different in habit and fructification from all the rest. That he made these mutually fertile, whence out of their progeny, fructification having been somewhat changed, Genera of natural classes have arisen as many in number as the different parents, and since this is not carried further, we regard this also as having been done by His Omnipotent hand directly in the beginning; thus all Genera were primeval and constituted a single Species. That as many Genera having arisen as there were individuals in the beginning, these plants in course of time became fertilised by others of different sort and thus arose Species until so many were produced as now exist ... these Species were sometimes fertilised out of congeners, that is other Species of the same Genus, whence have arisen Varieties.|From his '' Fundamenta fructificationis'' (1742)&lt;ref&gt;As quoted from Ramsbottom, (1938); in David Briggs (1997), ''"Plant Variation and Evolution"'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jens Christian Clausen (1967), refers to Linnaeus' theory as a "forgotten evolutionary theory [that] antedates Darwin's by nearly 100 years", and reports that he was a pioneer in doing experiments about hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Christian Clausen (1967), "Stages in the Evolution of Plant Species", Harper, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later observations by Protestant botanists [[Carl Friedrich von Gärtner]] (1772-1850) and [[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter]] (1733-1806) denied the immutability of species, which (according to Christian apologists{{which?|date=April 2017}}) the Bible never teaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v4/n1/species-change|title= Do Species Change?|work= Answers in Genesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kölreuter used the term "[[transmutation of species]]" to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization,&lt;ref name="plorenzano.files.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plorenzano.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/xxi-joseph-gottlieb-kc3b6lreuter-plorenzano.pdf |format= PDF |title= An Analysis of the Work of Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter and its Relation to Gregor Mendel's Work |author= Pablo Lorenzano |publisher= Plorenzano.files.wordpress.com |accessdate= 2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=January 2018}} although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not be responsible for the introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822-1884), aligning himself with the "new doctrine of special creation" proposed by Linnaeus,&lt;ref name="plorenzano.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s analysis of fossils and discovery of [[extinction]] disrupted static views of nature in the early 19th century, confirming geology as showing a historical sequence of life. British [[natural theology]], which sought examples of [[adaptation]] to show design by a benevolent Creator, adopted [[catastrophism]] to show earlier organisms being replaced in a series of creations by new organisms better adapted to a changed environment. [[Charles Lyell]] (1797-1875) also saw adaptation to changing environments as a sign of a benevolent Creator, but his [[uniformitarianism]] envisaged continuing extinctions and replacements.{{cn|date=April 2017}} As seen in correspondence between Lyell and [[John Herschel]], scientists were looking for creation by laws rather than by miraculous interventions. In continental Europe, the idealism of philosophers including [[Lorenz Oken]] (1779-1851) developed a ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' in which patterns of development from [[archetype]]s were a purposeful divine plan aimed at forming humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=108–109, 113–118, 133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists rejected [[transmutation of species]] as [[materialism|materialist]]&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=120–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|van Wyhe|2007|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] threatening the established hierarchies of society. The idealist [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807-1873), a persistent opponent of transmutation, saw mankind as the goal of a sequence of creations, but his concepts were the first to be adapted{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} into a scheme of theistic evolutionism. In ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' published in 1844, its anonymous author ([[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]) set out goal-centred progressive development as the Creator's divine plan, programmed to unfold without direct intervention or miracles. The book became a best-seller and popularised the idea of transmutation in a designed "law of progression". The scientific establishment strongly attacked ''Vestiges''  at the time, but later more sophisticated theistic evolutionists followed the same approach of looking for patterns of development as evidence of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparative anatomist [[Richard Owen]] (1804-1892), a prominent figure in the Victorian era scientific establishment, opposed transmutation throughout his life. When formulating [[Homology (biology)|homology]] he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his ''On the Nature of Limbs'' of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist [[Hewett Watson]] (1804-1881) and the Reverend [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] (1796-1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp= 125–126, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] said that in "continuous operation of Creative power" through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a "successive and continuous fashion" through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''On the Origin of Species''===
{{See also|Religious views of Charles Darwin}}
When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, many [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] accepted evolution provided it was reconciled with divine design. The clergymen [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Frederick Temple]], both conservative Christians in the [[Church of England]], promoted a theology of creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] welcomed the idea of [[natural selection]], as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity could be seen as a fallen race needing salvation. [[Aubrey Moore]] also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin's friend [[Asa Gray]] defended natural selection as compatible with design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin himself, in his second edition of the ''Origin'' (January 1860), had written in the conclusion:
{{Quote|I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator. |Chapter XIV: "Conclusions", page 428}}

Within a decade most scientists had started espousing evolution, but from the outset some expressed opposition to the concept of natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 [[Richard Owen]] attacked Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' in an anonymous review while praising "Professor Owen" for "the establishment of the axiom of ''the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things''".&lt;ref&gt;[Owen, Richard]. 1860. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=12&amp;itemID=A30&amp;viewtype=text Review of Origin &amp; other works.] ''Edinburgh Review'' 111: 487-532, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Herschel]] apparently dismissed Darwin's book as "the law of higgledy-pigglety&lt;!--sic, t not d--&gt;", and in 1861 he wrote of evolution that "An intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change–to regulate their amount–to limit their divergence–and to continue them in a definite course". He added "On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=186, 204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian scientist [[Sir David Brewster]] wrote an article called "[[s:The Facts and Fancies of Mr. Darwin|The Facts and Fancies of Mr. Darwin]]" in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God's perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin's book contained both "much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation", although accepting that "every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D8khAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22every+part+of+the+human+frame+has+been+fashioned+by+the+same+Divine+hand+%22&amp;dq=%22every+part+of+the+human+frame+has+been+fashioned+by+the+same+Divine+hand+%22&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yRe2Uvv4CMrs2wX8gYHwCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA Good Words]'' (1862), Volume 3. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s theistic evolutionism became a popular compromise in science, and gained widespread support from the general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]] insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] published ''The Reign of Law'', which explained beauty in [[plumage]] without any [[adaptation|adaptive benefit]] as design generated by the Creator's laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared  [[Vestigiality|rudimentary organs]] for a future need.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=204–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]], wrote in 1868: "Mr Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill ... and I do not [see] that 'the accidental evolution of organic beings' is inconsistent with divine design — It is accidental to us, not to God."&lt;ref&gt;[Letter of John Henry Newman to J. Walker of Scarborough, The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman, edited by C.S. Dessain and T. Gornall, vol. XXIV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp. 77-78. http://www.inters.org/Newman-Scarborough-Darwin-Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Darwin published his own research on human ancestry in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', concluding that humans were "descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears", which would be classified amongst the [[Quadrumana]] along with monkeys, and in turn descended "through a long line of diversified forms" going back to something like the larvae of [[Ascidiacea|sea squirts]].{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=406&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text 389]}} Critics promptly complained that this "degrading" image "tears the crown from our heads", but there is little evidence that it led to loss of faith. Among the few who did record the impact of Darwin's writings, the naturalist [[Joseph LeConte]] struggled with "distress and doubt" following the death of his daughter in 1861, before enthusiastically saying in the late 1870s there was "not a single philosophical question connected with our highest and dearest religious and spiritual interests that is fundamentally affected, or even put in any new light, by the theory of evolution", and in the late 1880s embracing the view that "evolution is entirely consistent with a rational theism." Similarly, [[George Frederick Wright]] responded to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' and [[Charles Lyell]]'s 1963 ''Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man'' by turning to Asa Gray's belief, that God had set the rules at the start and only intervened on rare occasions, as a way to harmonise evolution with theology. Wright's faith was not seriously shaken by evolution, but he later suffered a crisis when confronted with [[historical criticism]] of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/107-wrestling-with-doubt/|title= Wrestling with doubt - Christian History Magazine|work=Christian History Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance==
{{Main|Acceptance of evolution by religious groups}}
According to [[Eugenie Scott]]: "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of [[mainline Protestant]] [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church."&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; Studies show that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan; among 34 countries sampled, only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate of acceptance than the United States.&lt;ref name=miller-et-al&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1126746 |title=Science Communication: Public Acceptance of Evolution |year=2006 |last1=Miller|first1=J. D.|journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5788| pages=765–6 |pmid=16902112 |last2=Scott |first2=E. C. |last3=Okamoto |first3=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionism has been described as arguing for [[Relationship between religion and science|compatibility between science and religion]], and as such it is viewed with disdain both by some [[atheism|atheists]] and many [[creationism|creationists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0034412500024380|title=Creation and Evolution|year=2008|last1=Devine|first1=Philip E.|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32|issue=3|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hominization==
[[wikt:Hominization|Hominization]], in both science and religion, involves the process or the purpose of becoming [[human]]. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the [[Abrahamic religions]], which hold as a core belief that animals do not have [[Immortality of the soul|immortal]] [[soul]]s but that humans do.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] attributed "soul" (''anima'') to all organisms but taught that only human souls are immortal. See: Peter Eardley and Carl Still, ''Aquinas: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 34–35. In contrast, [[Dharmic religions]] (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) teach that all biological organisms have souls which pass from one life to another in the [[Transmigration of souls]]. See [http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html "Soul"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052029/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html |date=July 9, 2008 }}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07. Retrieved 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a [[special creation]] consisting of at least the addition of a [[soul]] just for the human species.&lt;ref&gt;Including the [[Catholic Church]], see Rahner, section "Hominization" by Karl Rahner in entry on "Evolution", 484-485; Scott, 271-272. Note that "special creation of man" in Catholic references is a far more restricted concept than "[[special creation]]" (q.v.) in typical Creationist usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific accounts of the [[origin of the universe]], the [[origin of life]], and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and to account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Theistic evolution typically postulates a point at which a population of [[hominid]]s who had (or may have) evolved by a process of natural evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to [[Adam and Eve]], or indeed to [[Mitochondrial Eve]], although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which such an event occurred should essentially be the same as in [[paleoanthropology]] and [[archeology]], but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term "[[special transformism]]" is sometimes used to refer to theories that there was a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.&lt;ref&gt;Rahner, 484-488; see also Artigas, 19, 23, 24, 35 etc&lt;/ref&gt;

Several 19th-century theologians and evolutionists attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics [[John Augustine Zahm]] and [[St. George Jackson Mivart]], but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps.&lt;ref&gt;The six leading examples are the subject of Artigas's book. Each of these has a chapter in Artigas: Léroy, Zahm, Bonomelli, Mivart, the English Bishop John Hedley, and Raffaello Caverni. All are also covered by Brundell.&lt;/ref&gt; and 20th-century thinking tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;

Finally - it seems today - a direct intervention in the development of the world and human beings is dispensed with altogether. The English philosopher Antony Flew was unfortunately right when he stated that through this constantly repeated strategy of protection and withdrawal with which we are familiar (and which for long decades kept young Catholics especially from the study of biology 'which endangers the faith'), the hypothesis of God was being 'killed by inches, the death of a thousand qualifications.'

===19th-century 'theistic evolution'===
{{See also|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection#Theistic evolution}}

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution" in a now-obsolete sense for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref name=Larson2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial [[mutation]]s to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution ([[orthogenesis]]) by specifying the laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.&lt;ref name=Larson2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |authorlink=Edward Larson |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of Scientific Theory |publisher=Modern Library |year=2004 |isbn=0-679-64288-9 |pages=125–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=George |title=The Reign of Law |date=1867 |publisher=Strahan |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Edward J.

''The New Answers Book: Over 25 Questions on Creation / Evolution and the Bible ''.

They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of treating it as historical. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call "[[Atheism|atheistic]]" [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] will confine [[God of the gaps|God to the gaps]] in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] through [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Gitt, Werner (2006).

== Historical ==

The influential Massachusetts preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with [[Edward Jenner]], the pioneer of smallpox [[vaccination]], and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to.&lt;ref name="Bazin2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Bazin|title=The eradication of smallpox: Edward Jenner and the first and only eradication of a human infectious disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=19 January 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-083475-4|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a tract on the subject in 1806,&lt;ref name="GlynnGlynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Glynn|author2=Jenifer Glynn|title=The Life and Death of Smallpox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL4W3YNMYLIC&amp;pg=PA112|date=30 August 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84542-7|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. [[John C. Lettsom]], an eminent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:

: "You have done more good than you imagine; and for everyone you may have saved by your actual operation, you have saved ten by your example; and perhaps, next to [[Edward Jenner|Jenner]], have been the means of saving more lives than any other individual."&lt;ref name="Rhodes2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rhodes|title=The End of Plagues: The Global Battle Against Infectious Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdRWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=24 September 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-38131-6|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Mindell, The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007 [2006]), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When vaccination was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;Durbach, Nadja. 2005. ''Bodily matters: the anti-vaccination movement in England, 1853–1907''. Radical perspectives. Durham: Duke University Press. pp 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-vaccinationists]] were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006.'' Epidemics laid low: a history of what happened in rich countries.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.  pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a number of [[Vaccination Acts]] were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when [[variolation|smallpox inoculation]] was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination  enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in [[Leicester]], a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898  Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law. &lt;!-- see Talk and Hansard--&gt;A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness6.htm About the Jehovah's Witnesses Christian denomination - Past opposition to vaccinations], religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]] selectively rejects various forms of medical care including vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/11/9000_nj_school_children_skipped_vaccinations_on_religious_grounds.html|title=Nearly 9,000 N.J. school children skipped vaccinations on religious grounds last year|author= Livio, Susan K|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031788.htm|title=Outbreak of Measles Among Christian Science Students – Missouri and Illinois, 1994|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation of Universal Wisdom, a religion based on belief in [[spinal adjustment|chiropractic spinal adjustments]] and [[Spirit of Guidance|Universal Intelligence]], forbids vaccinations.&lt;ref name=CUW&gt;{{Citation |date= |title=Congregation of Universal Wisdom |publisher=Congregation of Universal Wisdom |url=http://www.cuwisdom.org/ |accessdate=April 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellner&gt;{{Citation |last=Kellner |first=Mark |date=February 7, 2015 |title='Religious' objections to vaccinations?

Some conservative Christian groups in the United States oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact. For example, the [[Family Research Council]] opposes mandatory [[HPV vaccine|vaccination against HPV]], a virus that causes various cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hpv.html|title=Pinkbook - HPV - Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing, "Our primary concern is with the message that would be delivered to nine- to 12-year-olds with the administration of the vaccines.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has made vaccination an official initiative in its humanitarian relief program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Church Makes Immunizations an Official Initiative, Provides Social Mobilization|url=http://www.lds.org/church/news/church-makes-immunizations-an-official-initiative-provides-social-mobilization|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has also called on its members to see that their own children are properly vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/liahona/1978/07/immunize-children-leaders-urge "Immunize Children, Leaders Urge"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', July 1978 (accessed 2 August 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], religions with dietary prohibitions that regard particular animals as unclean, make exceptions for medical treatments derived from those animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Mynors G, Ghalamkari H, Beaumont S, Powell S, McGee P |url=http://www.npci.org.uk/therapeutics/cardio/diabetes1/resources/library_other_publications_drugs_of_porcine_origin.pdf |title=Drugs of porcine origin and their clinical alternatives: an introductory guide |format=PDF |publisher= National Prescribing Centre |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immunize.org/concerns/porcine.pdf |format=PDF |title= (Form letter EDB.7/3 P6/61/3) |publisher= World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |date=2001-07-17 |author=Gezairy HA |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aceh Province]], an autonomous province of [[Indonesia]] with its own Islamic Sharia Law, 80 percent of people refuse all vaccinations due to concerns about pig, or its derivatives, being used to make some vaccines (eating pig is considered [[haram]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2015/05/03/80-persen-warga-aceh-anggap-imunisasi-haram-ini-alasannya |title=80 Persen Warga Aceh Anggap Imunisasi Haram, Ini Alasannya |author=Hasanudin Aco |date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!---an English-language citation would be nice---&gt;

The use of [[fetal tissue in vaccines|fetal tissue in the development of vaccines]] has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to [[abortion]]. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year= 2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher= Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url= http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo/vacc/vacc&amp;lang=english |accessdate= 2008-12-03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060507072740/http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo%2Fvacc%2Fvacc&amp;lang=english |archivedate= 2006-05-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."&lt;ref name=Vatican/&gt;

===Political opposition to vaccination by religious groups===

The majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/news/statement-vaccinations-ou-rabbinical-council-america/|title=Statement on Vaccinations from the OU and Rabbinical Council of America|publisher=Orthodox Union|date=2015-02-10|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/205801/are-ultra-orthodox-turning-away-from-vaccination/?p=all|title=Are Ultra-Orthodox Turning Away From Vaccination?|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|work=Forward|date=2014-09-17|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 imams in northern [[Nigeria]] advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29781528/ns/health-infectious_diseases/t/muslim-clerics-finally-embrace-polio-campaign/#.VQC3WIF4qcY|title=Muslim Clerics Finally Embrace Polio Campaign|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries. The followers were also wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005.&lt;ref name=Clements&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Curr Drug Saf |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=117–19 |title=How vaccine safety can become political – the example of polio in Nigeria |vauthors=Clements CJ, Greenough P, Shull D |url=http://bentham.org/cds/samples/cds1-1/Clements.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-28 |doi=10.2174/157488606775252575 |pmid=18690921 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030913/http://bentham.org/cds/samples/cds1-1/Clements.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild poliovirus 2000–2008 |date=2008-02-05 |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204139/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in [[Borno State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Hundreds' dead in measles outbreak |publisher=IRIN |date=2007-12-14 |url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75883 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, nine health workers administering polio vaccine were targeted and killed by gunmen on motorcycles in [[Kano]], but this was an isolated incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21381773|title=Polio vaccinators killed in Nigeria|date=8 February 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33650543 | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria marks one year without recorded polio case | date=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local traditional and religious leaders and polio survivors worked to support the vaccination campaign,&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/23/us-health-polio-nigeria-idUSKCN0PX2RF20150723 | work=Reuters | title=Nigeria marks polio-free year, raising global eradication hopes | date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nigeria has not had a polio case since July 24, 2014; in 2017, if no new cases appear, Nigeria will be declared polio-free.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the 2000s, in [[Poliomyelitis in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and Afghanistan, some [[Taliban]] issued ''[[fatwa]]s'' opposing vaccination as an American plot to sterilize Muslims, and kidnapped, beat, and assassinated vaccination officials; the head of Pakistan's vaccination campaign in [[Bajaur Agency]] was assassinated in 2007, on his way back from a meeting with a religious leader.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110714/full/news.2011.418.html|title=Fake vaccination campaign raises real fears|last=Brumfiel|first=Geoff|work=Nature News|date=2011-07-14|accessdate=2017-03-14|doi=10.1038/news.2011.418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warraich HJ |title=Religious opposition to polio vaccination |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.3201/eid1506.090087 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/articles/issue/15/6/table-of-contents|year=2009 |pages=978–78 |pmid=19523311 |pmc=2727330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] spy ran a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign to search for Osama bin Laden; such actions were strongly condemned by US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/02/aid-groups-cia-osama-bin-laden-polio-crisis|title=CIA tactics to trap Bin Laden linked with polio crisis, say aid groups|last=Shah|first=Saeed|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-03-02|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international health [[NGO]]s,&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; the doctor involved was jailed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/23/doctor-bin-laden-cia-jail|title=Doctor who helped US in search for Osama Bin Laden jailed for 33 years|last=Boone|first=Jon|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-05-23|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CIA promised not to use vaccination as a cover again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/10/26/mistrust-and-polio-pakistan/xxBRaW1A6JnbkoKCeRdSSK/story.html|title=Mistrust and polio in Pakistan|last=Carroll|first=James|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2014-10-27|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genuine polio vaccinator had previously vaccinated Osama bin Laden's children and grandchildren in his compound in Abbottabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna|title=CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA|last=Shah|first=Saeed|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2011-07-11|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both major sides of the Afghani civil war now support polio vaccination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26121732 | work=BBC News | title=Afghanistan polio: First case in Kabul since 2001 | date=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and polio rates are declining rapidly in Afghanistan, with only five cases in Jan–July 2015.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; In [[Pakistan]] there were 28 cases in the same period.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

== Exemptions ==

In the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in [[Massachusetts]], the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/07363761111181464|title=Against medical advice: the anti-consumption of vaccines|date=|website=|publisher=The University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, New Zealand|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf |author= American Medical Association |title= Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA House of Delegates |quote= H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations |format=PDF |pages=460–61 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016 Australia introduced legislation that removed eligibility for childcare and welfare benefits if parents refuse to vaccinate their children, removing religious exemptions at the same time as the only religion to apply for an exemption (Church of Christ Science) deemed their exemption to no longer be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/no-jab-no-pay-reforms-religious-exemptions-for-vaccination-dumped/news-story/5941541520ab64a115704f58633a1d68 | title=religious exemption removed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Works of mercy''' (sometimes known as '''acts of mercy''') are practices which [[Christians]] perform.

The practice is popular in the [[Catholic Church]] as an act of both [[penance]] and [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. In addition, the [[Methodism|Methodist church]] teaches that the works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] which lead to holiness&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stephen Bowden|title=Encyclopedia of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGAUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+methodism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FT0TTrqAO4jl0QHH_dS-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|quote=Works of mercy are, therefore, not merely good deeds but also channels through which Christians receive God's grace.|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aid in [[sanctification]].&lt;ref name="Sanctification"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wesley]]|title=The Works of the Reverend John Wesley, A.M., Volume VI|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4BPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=works+of+mercy+sanctification&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Xj8TTt6pHMnd0QHt84C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=works%20of%20mercy%20sanctification&amp;f=false|publisher=J.

The works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=R Mauriello|first1=Matthew|title=Mercies Remembered|date=2011|isbn=9781612150055|pages=149-160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "Corporal works of mercy" which concern the material needs of others.
# "Spiritual works of mercy" which concern the spiritual needs of others.

[[Pope John Paul II]] issued a papal encyclical "''[[Dives in misericordia]]''" on 30 November 1980 declaring that "Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others."&lt;ref name=Misericordia &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II, ''Dives in misericordia'', §14, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, November 30, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the [[Divine Mercy]], which derives from apparitions of [[Jesus Christ]] to [[Saint Faustina Kowalska]].

==In the Catholic Church==
Based on Jesus' doctrine of [[the sheep and the goats]], the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a [[means of grace]] as good deeds&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2447|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their omission is a reason for damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:31-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|1287|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believes Jesus obeyed every [[mitzvah]] and fulfilled the Scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Philippians|2:8}}; {{Bibleverse|Matthew|5:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics perform the works of mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|520|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.&lt;ref name=Cathencycle &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy'']&lt;/ref&gt; In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, [[Pope Francis]] suggested "care for creation" as a new work of mercy, describing it as a "complement" to the existing works. Francis characterized this new work as having both corporal and spiritual components. Corporally, it involves "daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness". Spiritually, it involves contemplating each part of creation to find what God is teaching us through them.&lt;ref name="Francis 2016"&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-message-on-world-day-of-prayer-for-cr Pope Francis: Message on 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation] As a spiritual work of mercy, care for our common home calls for a “grateful contemplation of God’s world” (Laudato si', 214) which “allows us to discover in each thing a teaching which God wishes to hand on to us” (ibid., 85). As a corporal work of mercy, care for our common home requires “simple daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness” and “makes itself felt in every action that seeks to build a better world”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewane Cantu 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dewane |first1=Frank J. |authorlink1=Frank J.

===Corporal Works of Mercy===

Corporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mitzvah of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hospitality.html Jewish Library: Hospitality in Judaism] In Judaism, showing hospitality (hakhnasat orchim) to guests is considered a mitzvah. When one knows of strangers who are hungry or need a place to relax, it becomes a legal obligation. Some rabbis consider hakhnasat orchim (literally the “bringing in of strangers”) to be a part of gemilut hasadim (giving of loving kindness).&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh work of mercy comes from the [[Book of Tobit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/tobit/1 Tobit 1:16-22] 16In the days of Shalmaneser I had performed many charitable deeds for my kindred, members of my people. 17h I would give my bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked. If I saw one of my people who had died and been thrown behind the wall of Nineveh, I used to bury him.* 18Sennacherib returned from Judea, having fled during the days of the judgment enacted against him by the King of Heaven because of the blasphemies he had uttered; whomever he killed I buried. For in his rage he killed many Israelites, but I used to take their bodies away by stealth and bury them. So when Sennacherib looked for them, he could not find them. 19But a certain Ninevite went and informed the king about me, that I was burying them, and I went into hiding. When I realized that the king knew about me and that I was being hunted to be put to death, I became afraid and took flight. 20All my property was confiscated; I was left with nothing. All that I had was taken to the king’s palace, except for my wife Anna and my son Tobiah.* 21But forty days did not pass before two of the king’s sons assassinated him and fled to the mountains of Ararat. A son of his, Esarhaddon,* succeeded him as king. He put Ahiqar, my kinsman Anael’s son, in charge of all the credit accounts of his kingdom, and he took control over the entire administration.i 22Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I returned to Nineveh. Ahiqar had been chief cupbearer, keeper of the signet ring, treasury accountant, and credit accountant under Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians; and Esarhaddon appointed him as Second to himself. He was, in fact, my nephew, of my father’s house, and of my own family.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mitzvah of burial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm Chabad: The taharah, funeral and burial] Jewish law is unequivocal in its insistence that the body, in its entirety, be returned to the earth, in a way that allows for the natural process of its decomposition and re-integration with its primordial source--the soil of which it was formed. It also insists that in the interim between death and interment, the integrity and dignity of the body be respected and preserved.&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/new-work-of-mercy-enshrined-in-first-papal-message News.Va: New work of mercy] Since biblical times, Christians have been called to carry out 6 acts of mercy, listed in St Matthew’s Gospel – giving food and drink to the hungry and thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and the prisoners – with a 7th one, burying the dead, added in medieval times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
# To feed the hungry.
# To give water to the thirsty.
# To clothe the naked.
# To shelter the homeless. 
# To visit the sick.
# To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To bury the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"&gt;[http://scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2447.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church par. 2447] The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Works of Mercy===
Just as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/nasb/ezekiel/33.htm Ezekiel 33:7-9] 7Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me. 8“When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. 9“But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life.&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06619.html Jewish Virtual Library: Forgiveness] The rabbis go even further in the ethical demands made upon the injured party, for not only must he be ready to forgive his injurer, he should also pray that God forgive the sinner before he has come to beg forgiveness (Yad, loc. cit.; Tosef., BK 9:29; Sefer Ḥasidim ed. by R. Margalioth 1957, 267 no. 360). This demand is based on the example of Abraham, who prayed to God to forgive Abimelech (Gen. 20:17). The reasons the injured party should be ready to forgive the injurer are mixed. On the one hand is the self-regarding consideration, already mentioned, that forgiveness to one's fellow wins forgiveness from Heaven. As Philo states: "If you ask pardon for your sins, do you also forgive those who have trespassed against you? For remission is granted for remission" (ed. by Mangey, 2 (1742), 670; see also Yoma 23a). On the other hand there is the purer motive of imitatio dei. Just as it is in the nature of God to be merciful to His creatures, so man in attempting to imitate the ways of God should be forgiving toward those who have injured him (Shab. 133b; see Lev. 19:2). R. Naḥman combines both motives when he says: "Imitate God by being compassionate and forgiving. He will in turn have compassion on you, and pardon your offenses" (op. cit. 81–91).&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm Deuteronomy 15:11] For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.’&lt;/ref&gt; and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/2mc/12 2 Maccabees 12:42] Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen&lt;/ref&gt;

The works include:
#To instruct the ignorant.
#To counsel the doubtful.
#To admonish the sinners.
#To bear patiently those who wrong us.
#To forgive offenses.
#To comfort the afflicted.
#To pray for the living and the dead.&lt;ref name="Catechism"/&gt;

=== Representation in art ===
The Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the [[Middle Ages]], the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.
[[File:Caravaggio - Sette opere di Misericordia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]] by [[Caravaggio]], 1606/07 (Naples)]]
The [[Master of Alkmaar]] painted the polyptych of the ''Seven works of mercy'' (ca. 1504) for the [[Grote of Sint-Laurenskerk (Alkmaar)|Church of Saint Lawrence]] in [[Alkmaar, Netherlands]]. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.

The painting of the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger|Frans II Francken]] (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.

A major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of [[Caravaggio]] (1606/07) in [[Naples]], which was commissioned by the Confraternità del [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]] for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the ''Seven Works of Mercy'' in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting’s [[chiaroscuro]], the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains the bright light as a metaphor for [[mercy]], which "helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples.

==In Methodism==
In [[Methodist]] teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace.&lt;ref name="Wesley2"&gt;
{{cite web|title=Mission: The Works of Mercy |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Wesley/mission.stm |publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]] |quote=John Wesley believed that "means of grace," include both "works of piety" (instituted means of grace) and "works of mercy" (prudential means of grace). He preached that Christians must do both works of piety and works of mercy in order to move on toward Christian perfection. |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001209101500/http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Wesley/mission.stm |archivedate=9 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[works of piety]], they are necessary for the believer to move on to [[Christian perfection]].&lt;ref name="Wesley3"&gt;

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; legendary figures like [[Âu Cơ]], the [[Trung Sisters]] (Hai Bà Trưng), and Lady Trieu ([[Bà Triệu]]), as well as the cult of the Four Palaces. Đạo Mẫu is commonly associated with [[mediumship|spirit mediumship]] rituals—known in Vietnam as ''[[lên đồng]]''—much as practiced in other parts of Asia, such as Southern China, [[Myanmar]] ([[Mon people]]) and some community in [[India]]... Although the Communist government had initially proscribed the practice of such rituals, deeming them to be superstitions, they relented in 1987, once again legalizing their practice.

==Cult of Four Palaces==
The cult of Four Palaces (Tứ Phủ) worships a hierarchical pantheon of Taoist gods, Buddhist and historical figures. They included:
===Trinity of Goddesses (Tam Tòa Thánh Mẫu)=== 
*[[Liễu Hạnh|Sky Goddess]] (Mẫu Thượng Thiên) 
*[[Mẫu Thượng Ngàn|Forest Goddess]] (Mẫu Thượng Ngàn) 
*[[Mẫu Thoải|Sea Goddess]] (Mẫu Thoải) 

===Rank of Officials (Hàng Quan)=== 
===Rank of Ladies (hàng Chầu Bà)=== 
===Rank of Princes (hàng Ông Hoàng)=== 
Ten Princes are mythical or historical figures. 
===Rank of Gentlemen and Maidens (hàng Cô, Cậu)=== 
===Rank of Five Tigers and ông Lốt (Naga)===
