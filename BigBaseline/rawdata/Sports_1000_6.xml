Sport became increasingly popular in [[England]] and [[Ireland]] through the 17th century and there are several references to [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]], while [[bare-knuckle boxing]] was revived. The interest of gamblers in these sports gave rise to [[Professional sports|professionalism]]. The first known attempts to organise [[football]] took place in Ireland.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1681 — The ancient sport of [[Boxing|pugilism]] resurfaced in England during the late 17th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]], also known as [[prizefighting]]; the first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight was published in the ''London Protestant Mercury''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==[[Chess]]==
* Having been firmly established in Spain and Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries, chess became increasingly fashionable in France which, by the end of the 17th century, was the main centre of European chess.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Cotswold Games]]==
* [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]]'s [[Cotswold Games|Olimpick Games]] held in the [[Cotswolds]] from c.1604 to 1612.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045814/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Jean |title=The Curious Mystery of the Cotswold 'Olimpick' Games: Did Shakespeare Know Dover ... and Does it Matter? |journal=Sport in History |doi=10.1080/17460260902872602 |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=150–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* c.1611 — the world's earliest known organised cricket match was played at [[Chevening, Kent]] between teams styled [[Weald and Upland cricket team|Weald and Upland]] and [[Chalkhill cricket team|Chalkhill]].&lt;ref name=DU4&gt;Underdown, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1611 to 1660 — numerous court cases concerning cricket.&lt;ref name=LTL17C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |title=From Lads to Lord's – 17th century |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=17 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153250/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 September 1624 — death of [[Jasper Vinall]] (born c. 1590), the first cricketer known to die as a result of an injury received when playing the game.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;McCann, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Village cricket]] thrived in the middle period of the 17th century, but there is no evidence of teams of county strength being formed at this time.&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt;
* c.1660 — in the wake of the [[English Restoration]], the popularity of cricket as a gambling sport encouraged investment and patronage; the introduction of professional players and the formation of teams representative of multiple parishes, possibly whole counties, mark the beginning of an evolution from the level of village cricket towards a major standard.&lt;ref name=HSA23&gt;Altham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W10&gt;Webber, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt; 
* 1695 — Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] on the Act's expiry in 1696; it is from this time that matters concerning cricket and other sports could be reported in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp428-435 |title=Charles II, 1662: An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses |publisher=British History Online |work=Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5 |date=1628–80 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 July 1697 — the ''Foreign Post'' reported a "A Great Match in Sussex" played for fifty guineas, the earliest known record of a top-class match.&lt;ref name=FL18C1&gt;Buckley, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TJM3&gt;McCann, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Curling]]==
'''Events'''
* 1620 — earliest known use of the word "curling" found in the preface and verses of a poem by [[Henry Adamson]], printed in [[Perth, Scotland]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* 1602 — [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] described the game of "hurling to goals" being played in eastern [[Cornwall]] in his "Survey of Cornwall". The game had the earliest described rules requiring equal numbers, no playing of the ball on the ground, and banning the forward pass, with similarities to the modern game of [[Rugby football]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
'''Ireland'''
* 17th century — football games grew in popularity and were widely played under the patronage of the gentry; games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants and attracting wagers with purses of up to 100 guineas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1670 — the earliest record of a recognised precursor to modern football dates from a match in [[County Meath]] in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1695 — "foot-ball" is banned by the severe ''Sunday Observance Act'', imposing a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports on the Sabbath but it proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''
* 1603 — [[James VI of Scotland]] appointed Edinburgh bowmaker William Mayne as royal club-maker for his lifetime.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1605 — [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] became known as the home of horse racing in England after its discovery by [[James I of England|James I]] while out [[falconry|hawking]] or riding; the region has a long association with horses going back to the time of [[Boadicea]] and the [[Iceni]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1634 — by this time, spring and autumn race meetings had been introduced at Newmarket and the first Gold Cup event was held in 1634.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1654 — all horse racing banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and many horses requisitioned by the state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1664 — following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], racing flourished and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] instituted the [[Newmarket Town Plate]], writing the rules himself:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
::"Articles ordered by His Majestie to be observed by all persons that put in horses to ride for the Plate, the new round heat at Newmarket set out on the first day of October, 1664, in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord King Charles II, which Plate is to be rid for yearly, the second Thursday in October for ever".

==[[Lacrosse]]==
'''Events'''
* 15th–19th century — [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] played lacrosse to resolve conflicts, heal the sick, give thanks to the Creator and train for war in modern-day Canada and the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1636 — [[Jean de Brébeuf]], a French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary]], watched a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] game of lacrosse in what is now [[Ontario]], and he noticed that the sticks resemble a [[bishop]]'s [[crosier]] or "la crosse" in [[French language|French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Events in world sport through the years 1726 to 1730.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1726 — in several fights to 1730, [[Jack Broughton]] defeated unnamed opponents and won the admiration of [[James Figg]].&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/broughton-jack.htm |title=Jack Broughton |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 23 May 1727 — Figg and Ned Sutton fought in a 1 hour exhibition bout in London.&lt;ref name="JF"/&gt;

* 1729 — Tom Pipes, one of Figg's students, claimed the vacant Championship of England title and was generally recognized as such. He had seven fights to 1733 against Bill Gretting, winning four and losing three, but it is unclear if any of them were championship bouts.&lt;ref name="CBZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/barenuk.htm |title=The Bare Knuckle Heavyweight Champions of England |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/pipes-tom.htm |title=Tom Pipes |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1730 — George Taylor began boxing at Figg's Amphitheatre and was a big favorite there.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/taylor-george.htm |title=George Taylor |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
[[Image:Oldest cricket bat.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The oldest surviving bat from 1729. Note its "hockey stick" shape, which is very different from modern-day bats.]]
'''Events'''
* 1727 — [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]] was involved in the creation of [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] to establish the rules under which two matches were played, the first time that a set of rules is known to have been put in writing.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;McCann, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1728 — the earliest known instance of a county team (i.e., Kent) being acclaimed for its superiority over its rivals suggests the origin of the unofficial [[Champion County]] title.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1729 — the earliest known innings victory was achieved and 1729 is the date of the oldest known cricket bat still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1809 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1 February — English champion [[Tom Cribb]] retains his title by defeating [[James Belcher|Jem Belcher]] in 31 rounds at [[Epsom Downs]]
* 30 April — death of former English champion [[Hen Pearce]], who had retired in 1807 because of his failing health

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* It is about this time that the [[no-ball]] rule is first applied re the bowler's foot being over the crease. It would be applied to throwing in 1816.
* [[Lord's Old Ground]], home of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), has become the accepted venue for all great matches and it is the ambition of every aspiring cricketer to play there.  But Lord's is already losing its rural character as London expands and begins to surround it.  The landlord, Mr Portman, feels able to increase the rent and so [[Thomas Lord]] decides to seek another venue.  The lease on the "Old Ground" is due to expire on [[Lady Day]] in 1810 but Lord moves fast and, by May 1809, has secured a lease on another plot of land, part of the [[St John's Wood]] estate which belongs to the Eyre family.  He opens this "[[Lord's Middle Ground|Middle Ground]]" in time for the 1809 season but MCC at first refuses to relocate and continues at the Old Ground until the winter of 1810-11 when Lord stages a ''fait accompli'' by literally seizing "his turf" which is dug up and moved to the Middle Ground.
* [[John Sherman (cricketer)|John Sherman]] makes his debut in [[first-class cricket]].  His career continues to 1852 and is the joint-longest on record, equalled only by [[W. G. Grace]].
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] 464 (HS 114)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] 35

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* Inaugural running of the [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]
'''England'''
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Wizard (horse)|Wizard]]

[[File:AmericanFootballTraining.jpg|thumb|American football players practice agility drills]]
'''Agility drills''' &lt;ref&gt;Agility Drills.(2012). Retrieved August 15, 2012, from http://www.livestrong.com/agility-drills/&lt;/ref&gt; are used in the aim of improving sports agility, which is the ability to change direction and accelerate while in motion. The ability to change direction while in motion is very important in many sports but especially in team and dual sports. For example, a footballer running back must be able to quickly change direction when he sees an opponent preparing to tackle him and must be able to quickly change directions when dribbling the ball, attempting to get back on defense, or when trying to beat an opponent to the ball. A tennis player must be able to quickly change directions when moving to a position where the ball is expected to go but instead finds the ball going in a different direction.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis M. Build A Better Athlete What’s Wrong with American Sports and How to Fix It. Equilibrium Books, A Division of Wish Publishing, Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, 2006, pg 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direction changes==

Many more examples can be given but in almost all cases [[sports]] agility requires the player to quickly change directions in order to elude or stay with an opponent. The latter is especially important in football, [[basketball]] and [[lacrosse]] when covering an opponent. If a player cannot elude his opponent he will not be able to fulfill his assignment or position task. For example, he will not be able to receive a pass or to break free of his opponent to execute or perform some important task.

The quicker and sharper the changes in direction, the better the athlete can elude or stay with his or her opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis M. Build A Better Athlete What’s Wrong with American Sports and How to Fix It. Equilibrium Books, A Division of Wish Publishing, Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, 2006. pg 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to make quick sharp changes in direction also enables the player to exhibit great quickness.  In sports such as football there are many good running backs and receivers who can run fast in a straight line. But in order for them to be great, they must also be able to elude their opponents by changing direction quickly. If they do not have this ability they will never be great.

Thus the ability to change direction quickly while in motion is critical for sports success. Because of this coaches have devised many drills to improve this ability. In general, these drills are specific to different sports but some of them are applicable to many sports. For example, tumbling drills are usually more specific to [[swimmers]] who execute a flip turn and to gymnasts who use some aspects of tumbling in their routines on the apparatus or in free exercise.

==Jumping==

Drills that entail jumping with turns in the air are usually applicable to basketball players and receivers and pass defenders in football but can apply to many sports in interest of strength. Drills that use side jumps and front-back jumps are more specific to team sports in which the athlete must change direction while running. Drills that require jumping over objects is usually best suited for sports in which the player must leap over hurdles or players. These drills usually use some form of rope ladders, small or low hurdles, ladders, or small cones.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Frank and Kreis, E.J. “Doc”. Sports Agility.  Taylor Sports Publishing, Inc., Nashville, Tennessee 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ladders, hurdles and cones==

The drills that use ladders, hurdles and cones have proven to be extremely popular and are now used extensively in many different sports &lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Michael. Functional Training For Sports. Human Kinetics, 2004, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; By using these drills coaches take it for granted that the athletes will become quicker and faster and many cases, more explosive. However, close examination of these popular drills and how they are executed, shows that the actions involved in executing these drills is not specific to the actions that the athlete must execute in gameplay.

===Cutting action===

Agility drills can cause a huge benefit to athletes if the drills duplicate or use the cutting action. In this way the athlete gets reinforcement of the action and will be able to get a little quicker or faster as his sports skill is fine tuned. Being able to duplicate the key action that is involved in execution of the sports agility skill is the secret to the success of any agility drill. When the drills are executed often enough there is a transfer of how the athlete executes the skill to gameplay.

Thus if athletes do many ladder, hurdle or cone drills, they learn to drive the knees upward rather than forward. If instead they duplicated a true cutting action in which the feet stay close to the ground and the knees are driven forward it could bring about a positive transfer that could improve skill execution. Practicing the cutting action in a drill would be much more productive.

It is also possible to have coaches talk of developing fast feet with agility drills. Most often they use ladder drills in which you step over each rung and then stutter step two or three times before stepping over the next ladder step. You continue in this manner for the full length of the ladder. For variety they also have the athlete traverse the entire ladder sideways. Execution is basically the same in which the athletes drive the knees upward to go over each rung of the ladder. Also sometimes included are stutter steps in between which are supposed to develop faster feet.

==Cutting action==

However, the cutting action, which is the basis for running agility, is not a matter of fast feet, it is a matter of fast legs. One must be able to move the legs from the hips in order to move quickly or to execute quick cutting actions. In addition, the feet must remain close to the ground regardless of whether the step being taking is short or long. In other words, as the cut is being executed, the body is lowered and as the athlete pushes off, he steps out with the leg closest to the direction in which he wishes to move. He then takes a step out with the leg and turns the body so he can quickly assume the running position.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis M. ''Build A Better Athlete What’s Wrong with American Sports and How to Fix It''. Equilibrium Books, A Division of Wish Publishing, Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, 2006. pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; At times, it is necessary that the athlete have the ability to rotate the hips and/or shoulders a full 90° in order to be more evasive in the cutting action. This allows him to maintain eye contact with his opponent and maintain his shoulders in a front-facing position. In so doing, the opponent does not get any hints that a change in direction is about to take place.
Hurdle drills are essentially the same as ladder drills since their execution is basically the same. In these drills, you move in a linear or sideward manner. Cone drills however, are used mainly for side movements. In the drills, you leap sideways over a cone in one direction and then back in the opposite direction. The key to successful execution is for an athlete to bring their knees to their chest to successfully clear the top of the cone. This does not duplicate the cutting action.

For the drill to be successful in relation to improving sports performance on the field or court, it must include cutting actions. Learning how to do the cutting action is imperative. It involves both technical and physical components that are learned skills. These skills must be mastered in order to get maximum benefit in the agility drill.&lt;ref&gt;Verkhoshansky Y. , Mel C. Siff Super Training, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan, USA, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4625">In Greek antiquity, athletic festivals under the name of "Olympic games", named in imitation of the original [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], were held in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at [[Antioch]], obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]].

*[[Vergina|Aegae]] in [[Macedon]]ia. This festival was in existence in the time of [[Alexander the Great]].
*[[Alexandria]]. In later times, the number of Alexandrian conquerors in the great Olympic Games in [[Elis]] was greater than from any other state.
*[[Anazarbus]] in Cilicia. Lately introduced games.
*[[Antioch]] at Daphne, a small place, 40 [[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadia]] from Antioch, where there was a large sacred grove watered by many fountains. The festival was originally called [[Daphnea]], and was sacred to [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], but was called Olympia, after the inhabitants of Antioch had purchased from the Eleans, in 44 AD, the privilege of celebrating Olympic games. It was not, however, regularly celebrated as an Olympic festival until the time of the emperor [[Commodus]]. It commenced on the first day of the month [[Hyperberetaeus]], with which the year of Antioch began. It was under the presidency of an [[Alytarches]]. The celebration of it was abolished by [[Justin I]], 521 AD. The writings of [[Libanius]], and of [[Chrysostom]], the Christian Father, who lived many years at Antioch, gave various particulars respecting this festival.
*[[Athens]]. There were two festivals of the name of Olympia celebrated at Athens, one of which was in existence in the time of [[Pindar]] who celebrates the ancestors of the Athenian [[Timodemus]] as conquerors in it, and perhaps much earlier (Schol. ad Thuc. i. 126). It was celebrated to the honour of Zeus, in the spring between the [[Great Dionysia]] and [[Bendidia]] (see [[Bendis]]). The other Olympic festival at Athens was instituted by [[Hadrian]] 131 AD; from which time a new Olympic era commenced.
*[[Attalia]] in [[Pamphylia]]. This festival is only known to us by coins.
*[[Cyzicus]] in Mysia.
*[[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya.
*[[Dium|Dion]] in [[Macedon]]ia. These games were instituted by [[Archelaus I of Macedon]], and lasted nine days, corresponding to the number of the nine [[Muses]]. [[Euripides]] wrote and presented  [[Bacchae]] and [[Archelaus (drama)]] there. They were celebrated with great splendour by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and [[Alexander the Great]].

'''Blondes vs. Brunettes''' is a [[Powderpuff (sports)|powderpuff football]] game played in cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blondesvsbrunettes.org/ Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Fundraiser]&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the event are donated to The [[Alzheimer's Association]]. Games have been held in more than 40 cities and have cumulatively raised more than $5 Million for the care, support and research efforts of the Association.

==History==
The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative [[Joseph Hugh Allen]], died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2008.  Looking for a way to raise funds for the [[Alzheimer's Association]], Abbott organized a powder puff [[American football|football]] game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan.  Abbott, who was residing in [[Washington D.C.]] at the time, believed that too many [[charitable organizations]] were raising money through formal black tie events.  Along with her sister, she thought a powder puff football game that leveraged popular culture's [[blonde vs. brunette rivalry]] would be more appealing to a younger set of donors. She thought the $20 ticket price would provide a low cost way for attendees to support a good cause.&lt;ref name="nptimes"&gt;Staff writer (September 15, 2010) "Blondes vs. Brunettes: Grassroots Effort Scores for Alzheimer's Association” ''The Non-Profit Times'' Retrieved March 16, 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/blondes-vs-brunettes-1850 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020090503/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/blondes-vs-brunettes-1850 |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2005, the first [[blond]]e vs. [[Brown hair|brunette]] powder puff football game was played at [[Hains Point]] in Washington D.C. and raised $10,000.  Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington D.C area before settling in at [[George Washington University]]’s Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009.  Since its inception, the game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in the [[Washington Post]] and has raised over $500,000 in the Washington, D.C. alone.&lt;ref&gt;Argetsinger, Amy (November 13, 2013) “Athletes First, Stylistas Second” ''The Washington Post'' Retrieved November 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Football was being played in cities across the United States and each city has a slightly different approach to the game. “In Washington, the rivalry is intense. If friends are on opposite teams, they usually don't talk the weekend of the games," Abbott shared. &lt;ref name="nptimes"/&gt;  Cities that host the game include: Albany, [[Amarillo]],&lt;ref&gt;Amarillo Globe News "Alzheimer's Association's Blondes vs. Brunettes" Retrieved October 6, 2012 [http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2012-06-09/alzheimers-associations-blondes-vs-brunettes]&lt;/ref&gt; Akron, Atlanta, [[Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alz.org/texascapital/in_my_community_58524.asp "Welcome to Blondes vs. Brunettes Austin"]&lt;/ref&gt; Bakersfield, CA, Baton Rouge, Boston, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bvbbuffalo.com/ "Western New York Powderpuff Fundraiser"]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte, Burlington, IA, [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bvbchicago.org/ “Blondes vs. Brunettes - Chicago”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105022618/http://bvbchicago.org/ |date=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbia, SC, [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://act.alz.org/site/TR?fr_id=2181&amp;pg=entry ”Blondes vs. Brunettes – Columbus”]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Denver]],&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (June 7, 2012) "Brunettes Trounce Blondes in Benefit for Alzheimer's Association of Colorado"  ''The Denver Post.''

The game's increasing popularity in the Dallas-Fort Worth area resulted in the 2012 game moving to the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] to accommodate the larger crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, Ty (August 3, 2012) "Blondes vs. Brunettes for Charity - Cotton Bowl to host Blondes vs. Brunettes football game on Aug. 11" ''NBC Dallas-Fort Worth Channel 5''.

==Rules on hair color==
Game rules do not require that hair colour be natural and it is common for many of the girls on the blonde team to have dyed hair.&lt;ref&gt;Argetsinger, Amy (November 14, 2011) “Hair’s The Thing: Blondes vs. Brunettes is a Win-Win” ''The Washington Post'' Retrieved March 12, 2012  [http://blondesvsbrunettes.org/washington-post-hair%e2%80%99s-the-thing-blondes-vs-brunettes-is-a-win-win]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44323">'''Cheating in chess''' refers to a deliberate violation of the [[rules of chess]] or other unethical behaviour that is intended to give an unfair advantage to a player or team. Cheating can occur in many forms&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/sports/othersports/08chess.html?ex=1312689600&amp;en=5292ff7841b05021&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Cheating Accusations in Mental Sports, Too|accessdate=2007-01-01 | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can take place before, during, or after a game. Commonly cited instances of cheating include: collusion with spectators or other players, use of chess engines, rating manipulation, and violations of the [[touch-move rule]]. Many suspiciously motivated practices are not comprehensively covered by the rules of [[chess]]. On ethical or moral grounds only, such practices may be judged by some as acceptable, and by others as cheating.

Even if an arguably unethical action is not covered explicitly by the rules, article 11.1 of the [[FIDE]] laws of chess states: "The players shall take no action that will bring the game of chess into disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&amp;view=article|title=Laws of Chess|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while deliberately sneaking a captured piece back onto the board may be construed as an illegal move that is sanctioned by a time bonus to the opponent and a reinstatement of the last legal position, the rule forbidding actions that bring chess into disrepute may also be invoked to hand down a more severe sanction such as the loss of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/geurt58.pdf|title=Unusual Events or Are There Still Normal Games?|last=Gijssen|first=Geurt|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=30 July 2012}} (see answer to question by J. Roberts on p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
Cheating at chess is almost as old as the game itself, and may even have caused chess-related deaths. According to one legend, a dispute over cheating at chess led King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] to murder a Danish nobleman.&lt;ref name="CP1-4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA136&amp;lpg=RA3-PA136&amp;dq=canute+ulf+chess&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ne27GJsMFQ&amp;sig=oJo7D-d16b2hnb8Fnk-yR497clU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=byFETruHLY3UiAKqrc3KAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=canute%20ulf%20chess&amp;f=false|title=Chess Player, Volumes 1-4|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most anthologized chess stories is ''Slippery Elm'' (1929) by [[Percival Wilde]], which involves a ruse to allow a weak player to beat a much stronger one, using messages passed on [[Ulmus rubra#Medicinal|slippery-elm]] throat lozenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-19/cheating-at-chess-and-other-pastimes|title=Cheating at Chess and Other Pastimes|date=19 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television shows have engaged the plot of cheating in chess, including episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0649205|title="Mission: Impossible" A Game of Chess (TV Episode 1968)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539781|title="Cheers" Indoor Fun with Sammy and Robby (TV Episode 1990)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In televised shows based on humourist [[Tenali Rama]] (a real-life personality who lived under king [[Krishnadeva Raya]], ruler of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijaynagar]] during its most prosperous period), a loud-mouthed chess "unbeatable champion" (who mostly depends on winning by cheating) takes advantage of the emperor's sleep due to boredom and starts shouting along with followers (who have accompanied him from an opponent kingdom), successfully convincing the assembly that he has won.

In [[Satyajit Ray]]'s [[Shatranj ke Khiladi]] (one of only two Hindi films he made – both based on short-stories by [[Premchand]]), Mirja Sajjad Ali, fed-up by his opponent's childish playing habits, has to make rules that only the piece intended to be played should be touched, and taking more than five minutes to move  should simply mean defeat. (As [[chess clock]]s are ''still'' practically unknown  even in modern India, it was out of question during the middle of 19th century — the period in which the film is set.){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Automaton hoaxes===
In contrast to the modern methods of cheating by playing moves calculated by machines, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the public were hoaxed by the opposite deception in which machines played moves of hidden humans. The first and most famous of the chess automaton hoaxes was [[The Turk]] (1770), followed by [[Ajeeb]] (1868), and [[Mephisto (automaton)|Mephisto]] (1886).

==Collusion==
Over the years, there have been many accusations of collusion, either of players deliberately losing (often to help a friend or teammate get a [[Chess title|title norm]]), or of players [[draw by agreement|agreeing to draws]] to help both players in a [[chess tournament|tournament]]. One of the earliest evidences is with the Fifth American Chess Congress in 1880, when [[Preston Ware]] accused James Grundy of reneging on a deal to draw the game, with Grundy instead trying to play for a win.&lt;ref name="spinrad1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|title=The Scandal of 1880, Part One|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spinrad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article contemporary to the event stated, "Ware’s avowal of his right to sell a game in a tourney was a novelty in chess ethics ... Ware’s veracity has not been questioned, only his obliquity of moral vision ..."&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; Six prior allegations of similar collusion and bribery, including another against Ware, were listed from 1876 to 1880 in that article on the Ware-Grundy affair, which was published in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' on February 8, 1880.&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; More recently, researchers at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] have claimed, based on their analysis of statistical tests of match records against economic models, that Soviet chess masters may have colluded in world chess championships held from 1940 to 1964.&lt;ref name="wusl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/7935.html|title=Cheating in world chess championships is nothing new, study suggests|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoulNye"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=905612|title=Did the Soviets Collude? A Statistical Analysis of Championship Chess 1940–64|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington University study argues from the researchers' statistical findings that Soviet players may have agreed to draws between themselves to improve their standings.

Opinions differ over how effective collusion may be. For example, if a leading player draws his game, it may allow his rivals to gain ground on him by winning their games.  The most infamous alleged instance, the 1962 [[Candidates' Tournament]], is discussed further at the ''[[World Chess Championship 1963]]'' article.

In 2011, IM [[Greg Shahade]] wrote that "prearrangement of results is extremely commonplace, even at the highest levels of chess.  This especially holds true for draws... There is a bit of a code of silence at the top levels of chess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uschess.org/content/view/11247/632|title=The United States Chess Federation - Greg on Chess: the Trouble with Round-Robins|first=Jennifer|last=Shahade|website=www.uschess.org|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject had been partially broached (in the USA context) by [[Alex Yermolinsky]] a few years earlier, saying "It's no secret how people act when facing a last-round situation when a draw gives no prize ...  People will just dump games, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2004/08/reality-check.htm|title=Reality Check - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning an incident involving 2006 US Championship qualification, Shahade blamed the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]] for creating perverse incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2006/01/cheating-heart-attack.htm|title=Cheating Heart Attack - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederic Friedel reported that the PCA had considered running a series of open tournaments in 1990s, but for similar reasons given by [[John Nunn]] ultimately declined, saying that deliberately losing games was "very real in the many open tournaments that are staged all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-bilbao-draw-feedback-from-our-readers|title=The Bilbao Draw – feedback from our readers|date=6 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch-move rule==
{{see also|Touch-move rule}}
In chess, the "touch-move" rule states that if a player (whose turn it is to move) touches one of his [[chess piece|pieces]], it must be moved if it has a legal move. In addition, if a piece is picked up and released on another square, the move must stand if it is a legal move. If an opponent's piece is touched, it must be captured if it is legal to do so. These rules are often difficult to enforce because the only witnesses are the two players themselves. Nevertheless, violations of these rules are considered to be cheating.&lt;ref&gt;"When the man in the street hears of someone cheating at chess...usually involve a violation of article 7 of the Laws of Chess, usually called the 'touch-move' rule.", Lombardy &amp; Daniels, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"He stuttered, ''J'adoube'', and moved another piece instead, which is commonly known as cheating.", Evans, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

In one famous instance, [[Garry Kasparov]] changed his move against [[Judit Polgár]] in 1994 after momentarily letting go of a piece. Kasparov went on to win the game. The tournament officials had video records proving that his hand left the piece, but refused to release the evidence. A factor counting against Polgár was that she waited a whole day before complaining, and such claims must be made during the game. The videotape revealed that Kasparov did let go of the piece for one-quarter of a second. Cognitive psychologist Robert Solso stated that it is too short a time to make a conscious decision.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, pp. 284–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous incident occurred in a game between [[Milan Matulović]] and [[István Bilek]] at the [[World Chess Championship 1969|Sousse Interzonal]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1027634|title=Milan Matulovic vs Istvan Bilek (1967)|website=www.chessgames.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matulović played a losing move but then took it back after saying "J'adoube" ("I adjust"—which should be announced ''before'' adjusting pieces on their square). His opponent complained to the [[list of chess terms#Arbiter|arbiter]] but the modified move was allowed to stand. This incident earned Matulović the nickname "J'adoubović".&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 252, says "...he played in the Sousse Interzonal in which, after a little cheating (see j'adoube), he came ninth."  p. 185 (the "j'adoube" entry) says: "...withdrew a losing move saying "Ich spreche j'doube"; this ruse went unpunished...."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 European Championship saw a "[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263244 takeback game]" between [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] and [[Vladimir Malakhov (chess player)|Vladimir Malakhov]], who eventually finished first and second in the event. To quote the book ''Smart Chip'' by [[Genna Sosonko]]:&lt;ref&gt;Smart Chip From St Petersburg (and other tales from a bygone chess area), published by New in Chess, June 2014, {{ISBN|9789056914875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both grandmasters were fighting for the lead, and the encounter had huge sporting significance. In an ending that was favourable to him, Azmai[parashvili] picked up the bishop, intending to make a move with it instead of first exchanging rooks. Malakhov recalled: "Seeing that the rooks were still on the board, he said something like, "Oh, first the exchange, of course." put his bishop back, took my rook, and the game continued. I don't know what should have been done differently in this situation—in Azmai's place, some might have resigned immediately, and in my place, some would have demanded that he make a move with his bishop but I didn't want to ruin the logical development of the duel, so I didn't object when Azmai made a different move: the mistake was obviously nothing to do with chess! When we signed the score sheets, Azmai suggested to me that we consider the game a draw. After the game I was left with an unpleasant aftertaste, but that was due mainly to my own play."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheating with technology==
Technology has been used by chess cheats in several ways. Perhaps the most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, e.g., on the Internet. Another type of cheating, with the aim of boosting one's rating on an Internet chess site, is to sign on with a different [[IP address]] and user name (a form of [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppetry]]) to play and lose against themselves. Electronic communication with an accomplice during face-to-face competitive chess is another reported type of cheating. Games can be analyzed after the fact to give a probabilistic determination on whether a player received surreptitious help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Catch A Chess Cheater|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/21/324222845/how-to-catch-a-chess-cheater|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents===
Due to the great multiplication of technological cheating incidents, the following examples concentrate only on those that are either at a high level, or are of historical significance.

====High-profile====
* In the [[39th Chess Olympiad|2010 FIDE Olympiad Tournament]] at [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], three French players were caught in a scheme to use a computer program to decide moves. Their plan involved one player, Cyril Marzolo, following the tournament at home and using the computer program to decide the best moves. He would send the moves by SMS to the team coach, Arnaud Hauchard, who would then stand or sit at various tables as a signal to the player, [[Sébastien Feller]], to make a certain move. Sébastien Feller was given a two-year and nine months suspension, Cyril Marzolo was given a one-year and six-month suspension, and Arnaud Hauchard was given a three-year suspension by the FIDE Ethics Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europe-echecs.com/actualites/sanctions-confirmees-par-la-fide-4411.html|title=Sanctions confirmées par la FIDE|publisher=[[Europe Échecs]]|date=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other cases, each player involved was a legitimate Grandmaster or International Master. None of the other players on the team knew of this or were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= FIDE Ethics Commission suspends Hauchard, Feller and Marzolo | url=http://www.chessdom.com/fide-ethics-commission-suspends-hauchard-feller-and-marzolo|accessdate=22 November 2014 |publisher=chessdom |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheating chess champ banned | publisher=connexionfrance |url=http://connexionfrance.com/Chess-cheat-Feller-banned-world-champion-grand-master-SMS-text-12600-view-article.html |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scandals of [[Borislav Ivanov]] were a cause celebre in the chess world in 2012 and 2013, with first cheating being alleged at the Zadar Open, and then Kyustendil. He was banned for four months by the Bulgarian Chess Federation, though this ban was overturned due to procedural defects, and was not based upon the cheating allegations, but rather Ivanov's rude behavior toward his accusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html|title=bTV Репортерите: Борислав Иванов - виновен до доказване на противното|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009132856/http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html#|archive-date=9 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-79.com/news-64768.html|title=Съдът оневини благоевградския шахматист Борислав Иванов|first=Developed by Motion Limited|last=(http://www.motion.bg)|website=www.e-79.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After various interludes, he was banned permanently by the Bulgarian Chess Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2013/12/24/2209570_seriiniiat_izmamnik_borislav_ivanov_e_izkljuchen_ot|title="Серийният измамник" Борислав Иванов е изключен от българския шахмат|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents were significant as they were one of the first times that statistical methods were used to analyze move-matching with computer programs, even though in the end such evidence was never used in a formal legal procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessprofessionals.org/content/open-letter-kenneth-w-regan-cheating-chess|title=Open Letter from Kenneth W.

* At the 2014 Iasi Open 2014, Wesley Vermeulen was caught cheating by consulting a mobile phone in the toilet, admitted his offense, and was eventually banned for one year by both the Dutch chess federation and FIDE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schaaksite.nl/page.php?al=verklaring-international-chess-festival-iasi-open-2014 Iasi Open 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084006/http://schaaksite.nl/page.php?al=verklaring-international-chess-festival-iasi-open-2014 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schaakbond.nl/nieuws/bestuursbesluit-schorsing-wesley-vermeulen|title=Nieuwsoverzicht - Schaakbond|website=www.schaakbond.nl|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2015/FIDE_News/2015_EB_Agenda__Annexes/Annex_52.pdf FIDE Ethics Commission Decision 6/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2015, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Gaioz Nigalidze]] was banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered him consulting a [[smartphone]] with [[chess software]] in the [[washroom]] during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/sport/chess-championship-cheating-in-bathroom/index.html|title=Chess grandmaster cheats ... from the bathroom|first=Holly Yan|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/15-chess-news/8675-dubai-bans-georgian-chess-champion-caught-cheating-at-dubai-open-chess-tournament.html FIDE: Dubai bans Georgian Chess Champion Caught Cheating at Dubai Open Chess Tournament], 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was later stripped of his grandmaster title and banned from competition for three years, though he was allowed to keep his [[International Master]] title.&lt;ref&gt;FIDE Ethics commission, [http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2015/FIDE_News/Ethics_case_7_2015_Decision.pdf Case n. 7/2015: ''Allegations of Cheating against GM Nigalidze in Dubai Open, 2015''], 4 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2016, Sergey Aslanov was expelled from the Moscow Open, for a smartphone in the toilet, hidden under a loose tile behind a drainpipe. He declared himself to be guilty of error but not a crime, and was only suspended for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess-international.de/Archive/51075|title=Sergej betrügt mit Smartphone auf der Toilette (German)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310014013/http://www.chess-international.de/Archive/51075|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/21050|title=Уличённый в читерстве на Moscow Open Сергей Асланов отделался мягким наказанием - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/21135|title=Виновен в ошибках, но не в преступлении - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical====
* One of the earliest known cases of using technology to cheat occurred in the 1993 [[World Open chess tournament|World Open]]. An unrated newcomer wearing headphones used the name "John von Neumann" (matching the name of a [[John von Neumann|famous computer science pioneer]]), and scored 4½/9 in the Open Section, including a draw with a [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] and a win over a 2350-[[ELO rating system|rated]] player. This player seemed to have a suspicious bulge in one of his pockets, which appeared to make a soft humming or buzzing sound at important points in the game. When he was quizzed by the tournament director, he was unable to demonstrate even a rudimentary knowledge of some simple chess concepts, and he was disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3605|title=Minutes of the Chess Cheating conference in New York|date=2007-01-11|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1998 Böblinger Open saw Clemens Allwermann latterly accused of cheating using [[Pocket Fritz|Fritz]], and after an investigation by the district attorney was inconclusive as to the evidence, the Bavarian Chess Federation barred him from participating in future tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/a-history-of-cheating-in-che-3-|title=A history of cheating in chess (3)|date=18 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Lampertheim Open Tournament 2002 the arbiter announced the disqualification of a player before round seven. Markus Keller explained what had happened:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/scandal-in-lampertsheim-cheating-in-the-loo|title=Scandal in Lampertsheim – cheating in the loo|date=7 January 2003|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;In the sixth round a player came to me and said he suspected his opponent, W.S. from L., was using illicit aids during the game. He often left the board for protracted periods of time to go to the toilet, even when (especially when) it was his turn to play. He had done this in earlier rounds against other players as well. I watched W.S. and noticed that he played a number of moves very rapidly and then disappeared in the toilet. I followed him and could hear no sound coming from the stall. I looked under the door and saw that his feet were pointing sideways, so that he could not have been using the toilet. So I entered the neighbouring stall, stood on the toilet bowl and looked over the dividing wall. I saw W.S. standing there with a handheld PC which displayed a running chess program. He was using a stylus to operate it. I immediately disqualified the player. When confronted he claimed that he was only checking his emails, so I asked him to show me the computer, which he refused to do. There are witnesses for my investigation in the toilet, and we will ask the chess federation of our state to ban the player from playing in other tournaments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In the HB Global Chess Challenge 2005 (in Minneapolis, Minnesota), a player in the Under-2000 section exited the event under suspicion of cheating, while his final-round game was under way. According to tournament officials, he was caught repeatedly talking on his cell phone during his game—which the published rules for that event expressly prohibited. Directors suspected that he was receiving moves over the phone from an accomplice elsewhere in the building. His results were expunged from the tournament and an ethics complaint lodged. Six weeks later, the same player entered the World Open and tied for first through third place in the Under-2200 section, pocketing $5,833. An attempt was made to eject him midway through that event, when the organizers belatedly learned about the earlier incident in Minnesota. But, lacking any specific allegation that he was cheating in the World Open, they backtracked and re-admitted him after he threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |title=Blockade Chess Cheaters  USCF Petition |publisher=SeniorChess |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160021/http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Subroto Mukerjee memorial international rating chess tournament 2006, an Indian chess player was banned from playing competitive chess for ten years due to cheating.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061212/asp/jamshedpur/story_7127264.asp|title=Verdict on chess cheating this week|accessdate=2014-01-21 | location=Calcutta, India|work=The Telegraph|date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tournament at Subroto Park, [[Umakant Sharma]] was caught receiving instructions from an accomplice using a [[chess computer]] via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled device which had been sewn into his cap.&lt;ref name="the hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/06/stories/2006120612002200.htm|title=Player expelled for technology misuse|accessdate=2006-12-28 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |title=Chess player caught cheating with wireless device |accessdate=2006-12-28 |work=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101060744/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |archivedate=1 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His accomplices were outside the building, and were relaying moves from a computer simulation. Officials became suspicious after Sharma had made unusually large gains in rating points during the previous 18 months, even qualifying for the national championship.&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"/&gt; Umakant began the year with an average rating of 1933, and in 64 games gained over 500 points to attain a rating of 2484. Officials received multiple written complaints alleging that Umakant's moves were in exactly the same sequence suggested by the chess computer.&lt;ref name="the hindu"/&gt;  Eventually, in the seventh round of the tournament, [[Indian Air Force]] officials searched the players on the top eight boards with a metal detector and found that Umakant was the only player who was cheating. Umakant's ten-year ban was imposed by the All India Chess Federation (AICF) after reviewing evidence presented by Umakant himself and the electronic devices seized by the tournament organizers.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;  The penalty was considered harsh, especially considering that those in other sports who have been found to be [[Doping (sport)|doping]] and [[match fixing]] did not receive such lengthy suspensions.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |title=Umakant Shama banned for 10 years |accessdate=2006-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103191122/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |archivedate=3 January 2007 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When officials were asked about the suspension they stated, "We wanted to be frank and send a stern message to all players. It is like cheating on exams."&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;
* In the Philadelphia World Open 2006, Steve Rosenberg, who was playing in a lower section, was leading before the final round. A victory would have been worth about $18,000. He was confronted by a tournament director and found to be using a wireless transmitter and receiver called a "Phonito". He was disqualified from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3280|title=Cheating Accusations at the World Open|date=2006-08-10|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a Dutch League 2C 2007 match between Bergen op Zoom and AAS, the arbiter caught the team captain of AAS (who was playing on board 6) using a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]. The player was outside the playing hall, with permission, to get some fresh air. The arbiter had followed him and caught him using [[Pocket Fritz]]. On the screen, the actual position of the game was shown. The arbiter declared the game lost and informed the Dutch Federation about the incident. The competition manager communicated a heavy penalty: the player was banned from playing in the Dutch League and Cup matches, not only for that season, but also for the next two seasons. The competition manager applied article 20.3 of the Federation's competition regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/dutch-chess-player-banned-after-using-pocketfritz/|title=Dutch chess player banned after using PocketFritz|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2007-11-09|publisher=ChessVibes.com|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Dubai]] Open 2008, M. Sadatnajafi, an untitled Iranian player (rated 2288 at the time), was disqualified from the tournament after he was caught receiving suggested moves by [[text message]] on his [[mobile phone]] while playing Grandmaster [[Li Chao (chess player)|Li Chao]].&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wesley So wins Dubai Open, player disqualified for cheating | publisher=[[ChessBase]] | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4570 |  accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was being relayed live over the Internet and it was alleged that his friends were following it and guiding him using a computer.&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"/&gt;
* In the Norths Chess Club Centenary Year Under 1600 Tournament a 14-year-old boy was caught using what the arbiter called a "hand-held machine" in the toilets. The game was declared lost and the boy was expelled from the tournament. He was using the program [[Chessmaster]] on a [[PlayStation Portable]], and that was probably the reason why the moves were not particularly strong. It was the first example of a chess player getting caught while using an electronic device in Australia, and so it quickly became a big story in the relatively small Australian chess community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/is-cheating-always-newsworthy/|title=Is cheating always newsworthy|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2009-01-08|publisher=ChessVibes|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[German Chess Championship]] 2011, FM Christoph Natsidis used a chess program on his [[smartphone]] during his last-round game against GM [[Sebastian Siebrecht]]. Natsidis admitted that he had cheated, and was disqualified from the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/crosswords/chess/chess-christoph-natsidis-punished-for-cheating.html|title=Christoph Natsidis Punished for Cheating|last=McClain|first=Dylan|date=2011-06-12|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the 2012 Virginia Scholastic and Collegiate Championships, a player was caught using a chess engine running on a PDA.  The player was disqualified from the tournament, had his membership to the Virginia Chess Federation suspended, and had an ethics complaint filed to the USCF.  Unlike other incidents, the player was using the chess engine disguised as using eNotate, which is one of two electronic chess notation programs permitted to be used at USCF tournaments. While the player only admitted to using the chess engine in that one match, his results suggested he had been using the program for several tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The evolution of cheating in chess |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8362701/the-evolution-cheating-chess | author=Dave McKenna| publisher=Grantland.com (ESPN) | date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the 2013 Cork Congress Chess Open, a 16-year-old player was found to be using a chess program on a smartphone when his opponent, Gabriel Mirza, confronted him in the toilets, kicking down the cubicle door and physically hauling him out. Mirza received a ten-month ban for bringing chess into disrepute for his violent conduct, while his opponent was only banned for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/teen-caught-in-chess-cheat-row-is-banned-30127759.html|title=Teen caught in chess cheat row is banned - Herald.ie|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local-news/good-news-for-limerick-chess-player-at-centre-of-cheat-row-1-5044989|title=Good news for Limerick chess player at centre of cheat row|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/chess-union-to-investigate-cheating-row-between-players-29220748.html|title=Chess union to investigate cheating row between players - Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2016, the blind Norwegian player Stein Bjørnsen was accused of cheating after playing games that showed a very high correlation with computer analysis. Due to his disability, Bjørnsen had been allowed to keep a record of his moves with a recorder coupled to an ear plug. The ear plug was later found to be incompatible with the recorder, but capable of receiving messages by [[Bluetooth]]. In April 2016 he received a two-year ban on domestic competition from the Central Board of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/sport/sjakk/blind-sjakkspiller-utestengt-for-juks/a/23667458/|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestengt for juks|last1=Aaserud|first1=Mikal|last2=Christiansen|first2=Anders K.|date=25 April 2016|work=Verdens Gang|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnsen's appeal to the federation's rules committee was turned down in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/blind-sjakkspiller-utestenges-i-to-ar/62442079|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestenges i to år|last=Bryne|first=Lars|date=9 September 2016|publisher=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnson returned in 2018 after serving the ban. In March that year he was caught with a Bluetooth earpiece taped to his hand during a club tournament in [[Horten]]. The federation expelled Bjørnsen in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sb.no/sjakk/sandefjord/sport/jukset-mot-niaring-na-er-han-ekskludert-fra-sjakkforbundet/s/5-73-708255|title=Jukset mot niåring – nå er han ekskludert fra sjakkforbundet|last=Andreassen|first=Erik|date=24 May 2018|publisher=Sandefjords blad|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating manipulation==

Since the introduction of [[Elo ratings]] in the 1960s, a number of attempts have been made to manipulate the rating system, either to deliberately inflate one's rating or to disguise one's strength by deliberately losing rating points.

===Sandbagging===
Sandbagging involves deliberately losing rated games in order to lower one's rating so that one is eligible to enter the lower rated section of a tournament with substantial prize money. This is most common in the United States, where the prize money for large open tournaments can be over $10,000, even in the lower rated sections. Sandbagging is very difficult to detect and prove, so [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] has included minimum ratings based on previous ratings or money winnings to minimize the effect.

===Small pools of players===
A limited pool of players who rarely or never play against players from outside of that pool can cause distortions in the Elo rating system, especially if one or more of the players is significantly stronger than the others, or if the results are deliberately manipulated.

[[Claude Bloodgood]] was accused of manipulating the [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] rating system in this way; at his peak in 1996 his USCF rating was in excess of 2700, the second highest in the country at the time. As a long-term prison inmate, he was necessarily restricted in the range of opponents available to him. The USCF suspected that he had deliberately inflated the ratings of his opponents; Bloodgood denied this, attributing his inflated rating to a quirk in the rating system resulting from his regularly playing against a limited pool of much weaker players.

There was widespread reporting of anomalous Burmese (Myanmar) rating movements in the late 1990s, with Milan Novkovic giving an analysis of manipulation in ''Schach'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekinchess.com/html/twic226.html This Week in Chess 226, section 4 (originally in ''Schach'' magazine 3/99)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===False tournament reports===
The most notable international example of ratings manipulation involves Romanian [[Alexandru Crisan]], who allegedly falsified tournament reports to gain a Grandmaster title and was ranked 33rd in the world on the April 2001 [[FIDE]] rating list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/toparc.phtml?cod=13|title=Top 100 Players April 2001 FIDE Top players archive|first=|last=Administrator|website=ratings.fide.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee overseeing the matter recommended his rating be erased and his Grandmaster title revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |title=FIDE Ruling on Alexandru Crisan (web archive) |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |work=The Week in Chess Magazine |publisher=London Chess Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030317071540/http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |archivedate=17 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Romanian Chess Federation initially favored action against Crisan, eventually he himself became the RCF president and changed the policy, creating such a situation that FIDE intervened to broker a resolution regarding many problems in the RCF, including Crisan's rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=22 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040522221850/http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|archivedate=22 May 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisan then was arrested and imprisoned on fraud charges relating to his management of the company Urex Rovinari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitorulexpres.ro/?mod=ultima_ora&amp;p=ultora_local&amp;s_id=106394|title=Alexandru Crişan, condamnat la patru ani de închisoare|first=|last=User|website=www.monitorulexpres.ro|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disappeared from chess,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/anatoly-karpov-speaks-his-mind|title=Anatoly Karpov speaks his mind|date=6 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus failing to fulfill the conditions of the resolution and so activating the above recommendations regarding title revocation. FIDE did not fully update its online information until August 2015, when all his titles were removed and his rating adjusted downwards to 2132.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml ''FIDE rating list archive''], download and compare Crisan's rating between the July 2015 and August 2015 (FIDE ID 1201271)&lt;/ref&gt; When writing about the Crisan case, Ian Rogers alleges that Andrei Makarov (at the time a FIDE vice-president and Russian chess federation president) had arranged an IM title for himself through nonexistent tournaments in 1994.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

Rumors of rigged tournaments are not unheard of in the chess world. For instance, in 2005, FIDE refused to ratify norms from the Alushta (Ukraine) tournaments, claiming that the games did not meet ethical expectations. A number of players involved protested over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/dear-kirsan-nikolayevich-alushta-is-for-real-/708|title=Dear Kirsan Nikolayevich, Alushta is for real!|date=24 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A different Ukrainian tournament in 2005 was found to be completely fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl|date=3 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl-revisited|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl revisited|date=23 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the strongest players are not involved in these, as they are more for careerist players to gain title norms or small rating gains, but [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to allow him to reach the chess elite.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auschess.org.au/columns/ct/ct160901.htm|title=Chess Column|website=www.auschess.org.au|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/19535|title=Evgeny Sveshnikov: "Only fools learn from their mistakes. It seems I am one of them..." - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strumica 1995, Azmai's Answer ''New in Chess'' 1996/3, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to these high-profile Crisan and Azmaiparashvili incidents as "open secrets", at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmsquare.com/sveshnikovFIDE.html|title=GrandMaster Square &gt;&gt;&gt; Letter from GM Sveshnikov|website=www.gmsquare.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneous games==
A player with no knowledge of chess can achieve a 50% score in [[simultaneous chess]] by replicating the moves made by one of his white opponents in a match against a black opponent, and vice versa; the opponents in effect play each other rather than the giver of the simul. This may be considered cheating in some events such as [[Basque chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/che-magazine-basque-che-does-it-work-for-you-|title=CHESS Magazine: Basque Chess – does it work for you?!|date=29 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used against any even number of opponents.  [[Stage magician]] [[Derren Brown]] used the trick against eight leading British chess players in his television show.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Circuit training''' is a form of body conditioning or [[endurance training]] or [[resistance training]] using high-intensity. It targets strength building or muscular endurance. An exercise "circuit" is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportireland.ie/Coaching-Ireland/Publications-/Circuit-Training.pdf|title=CIRCUIT TRAINING. Development of Strength &amp; Conditioning|last=Comyns|first=Tom|date=|website=Coaching Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1953 at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="UNM"&gt;{{cite web

==Typical activities in a circuit training==
A circuit should work each section of the body individually. Typical activities include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmac.co.uk/circuit.htm|title=Circuit Training|author=Brian Mackenzie|work=brianmac.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of circuit training==
Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute show that circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. Studies show that circuit training helps women to achieve their goals and maintain them longer than other forms of exercise or diet.&lt;ref name="Curves"&gt;Heavin, Gary and Colman, Carol, C. Reprint edition (December 7, 2004). ''Curves: Permanent Results Without Permanent Dieting'', {{ISBN|0-399-52956-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan and Anderson claim:

Perhaps a most profound finding of this study, from a health perspective, is that this investigation clearly shows that performance of this circuit of exercises,this level of intensity elicited oxygen consumption values (39% to 51.5% of VO2max) that meet established guidelines of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) for the recommended intensity (40% to 85% of [[VO2max]]R) of exercise for developing and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klika|first=Brett|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx#P98 |publisher=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|accessdate=20 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this circuit not only provides a suitable muscular fitness stimulus but also helps to meet ACSM cardiovascular guidelines and the newly published Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 for physical activity.&lt;ref name="UNM" /&gt;
}}

One advantage is that reduced station times will encourage the participants to lift heavier weights, which means they can achieve overload with smaller number of repetitions: typically in the range of 25 to 50 depending on their training goals.&lt;ref name="ACSM"&gt;http://westvalley.edu/academics/pe_department/physical_education/programs/weighttraining/acsm-resistancetraining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ND DN 2006FO.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Court Philippe Chatrier]] at [[Stade Roland Garros]] in Paris during the [[2006 French Open]].]]

A '''clay court''' is one of many different types of [[tennis court]]. Clay courts are made of crushed [[shale]], [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[brick]], or other unbound mineral aggregates. The [[French Open]] uses clay courts, making it unique among the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. Clay courts are more common in Continental Europe and Latin America than in North America, Asia or Britain. Two main types exist: [[#Red clay|red clay]], the more common variety, and [[#Green clay|green clay]], also known as "rubico", which is a harder surface. Although less expensive to construct than other types of tennis courts, the maintenance costs of clay are high as the surface must be rolled to preserve flatness.&lt;ref name="What is clay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltennisdesign.com/articles/clay_courts_p.htm|title=Clay Courts: What Are They Anyway?|first=Andrew R.|last=Lavallee|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
Clay courts favor the "full [[Grip (tennis)|western grip]]" for more [[topspin]]. "Clay-courters" generally play in a semicircle about {{convert|1.5|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} behind the baseline.

Clay courts are considered "slow" because the balls bounce relatively high and lose much of their initial speed when contacting the surface, making it more difficult for a player to deliver an unreturnable shot. [[point (tennis)|Points]] are usually longer as there are fewer [[winner (tennis)|winners]]. Therefore, clay courts heavily favor [[baseliner]]s who are consistent and have a strong defensive game, which has allowed players such as [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Björn Borg]], [[Chris Evert]], and [[Justine Henin]] to find success at the French Open.

Clay court players use topspins to throw off their opponents. Movement on gravel courts is very different from movement on any other surface. Playing on clay often involves the ability to slide into the ball during the stroke, as opposed to running and stopping like on a hard or grass court. Players who excel on clay courts but struggle to replicate the same form on fast courts are known as [[clay-court specialist]]s.

Clay courts are unique in that the ball bounce leaves an impression in the ground, which can help determine whether a shot was in or out. Critics of red clay courts point to the constant need to wet them down, problems renewing the surface if it dries out, and the damage caused to clothing and footwear through stains. All clay courts, not just red clay, tend to cause a build-up of clay on the bottom of the shoes of the players, needing constant removal.

==Variants==
===Red clay===
Almost all red clay courts are made not of natural clay but of crushed brick that is packed to make the court, with the top most layers consisting of finely crushed loose particles. Such courts are most common in Europe and Latin America.

''En tout cas'' (Fr. "in any case") is a version of red clay with a coarser top layer to improve drainage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.en-tout-cas.co.uk/ En-Tout-Cas Sports Surfaces home page&lt;/ref&gt; The coarser surface allows more water to run through the surface of the court drying the surface more quickly after rain.&lt;ref name="What is clay"/&gt; 

Natural clay courts are rare because this type of surface does not absorb water easily and takes two to three days to dry. A good example of natural red clay can be seen at the Frick Park Clay Courts in [[Pittsburgh]], a public facility of six red clay courts that has been in continual use since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clayfricktennis.org/|title= Frick Park Clay Court Tennis Club |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green clay===
[[File:Maria Sharapova, 2008 Family Circle Cup.JPG|thumb|[[Maria Sharapova]] during the [[2008 Family Circle Cup]] played on green clay]]

'''Green clay''', also called '''rubico''' and the brand name '''Har-Tru''', is similar to coarse red clay, but is made from crushed [[Amphibolite|metabasalt]] rather than brick,&lt;ref name="Har-Tru Green Clay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Har-Tru Classic Green Clay|url=https://hartru.com/pages/har-tru-green|website=Har-Tru|publisher=Har-Tru LLC|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the surface slightly harder and faster. Green clay is packed to make the subsurface. It is then covered with a topping. These courts are located primarily in the eastern and southern United States.

There is one [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournament played on green Har-Tru clay courts, the [[Volvo Car Open]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

[[Rafael Nadal]], winner of eleven French Open men's singles titles, is noted for his success on clay; since his debut in 2005, he has only lost twice at the tournament – in [[2009 French Open|2009]] and [[2015 French Open|2015]]. Nadal holds the record for the longest [[ATP World Tour records#Winning streaks|winning streak]] by any male player on a single surface since the [[tennis open era]] began in 1968: 81 clay court wins between April 2005 and May 2007. He also holds the record for most titles won on clay in the open era with 55 trophies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/barcelona-2018-final-nadal-tsitsipas|title=Rafa Romps To 11th Barcelona Title {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Thomas Muster]] is also considered a successful clay court player; although he only won the French Open once, 40 out of his 44 career singles titles were won on clay.

On the women's side, [[Justine Henin]] and [[Monica Seles]] hold the record for the number of consecutive [[List of French Open women's singles champions|French Open titles]] won at three (1990–1992 for Seles and 2005–2007 for Henin). In the pre-open era this feat was first achieved by [[Helen Wills Moody]] (1928–1930) and followed by [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] (1935–1937).

[[Chris Evert]] holds the record for longest winning streak on clay for either gender in the open era: from August 1973 to May 1979, she won 125 consecutive clay court matches. During this time Evert skipped three editions of the French Opens (1976–78), to participate in [[World Team Tennis]]. She also has the highest career win percentage on clay courts (94.28%) during the open era.

The most successful currently active female player on clay is [[Serena Williams]], who won the French Open thrice, in 2002, 2013 and 2015. In 2013, Williams went undefeated throughout the clay court season, winning five titles on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/10/serena-williams-confirms-greatness-with-french-open-win/ Serena Williams confirms greatness with French Open win], ''The Roar'', 10 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-22/serena-takes-out-swedish-open-title/4834556 Tennis: Serena Williams racks up 51st win to take Swedish Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clay-court specialist===
[[File:Nadal vs Federer RG 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Nadal]] is known as "The King of Clay."]]
A clay-court specialist is a tennis player who excels on clay courts.

Due in part to advances in racquet technology, current clay-court specialists are known for employing long, winding groundstrokes that generate heavy [[topspin]], strokes which are less effective when the surface is faster and the balls do not bounce as high. Clay-court specialists tend to slide more effectively on clay than other players. Many of them are also very adept at hitting the [[drop shot]], which can be effective because rallies on clay courts often leave players pushed far beyond the baseline. Additionally, the slow, long rallies require a great degree of mental focus and physical stamina from the players.

The definition of "clay-court specialist" has varied, with some placing players such as [[Thomas Muster]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], and [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] in that category, even though these players have won tournaments (including Masters Series events) on other surfaces. However, since these players won major titles only at the [[French Open]], they are sometimes labeled as such. Other players, such as [[Sergi Bruguera]], [[Albert Costa]] and [[Gastón Gaudio]] were French Open champions who won all or very nearly all of their career titles on clay. Among female players, there have been very few whose best results were confined exclusively to clay. [[Virginia Ruzici]], [[Anastasia Myskina]], [[Iva Majoli]], [[Sue Barker]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Francesca Schiavone]], [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] and [[Simona Halep]] are the only female players to have won major titles at only the French Open since the beginning of the open era.

Increasingly, clay courters have attempted to play better on other surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ford | first = Bonnie D | title = Nadal the lead warrior in Spanish surge on grass | publisher = EPSN.com | date = 27 June 2008 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ford_bonnie_d&amp;id=3463241 | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Van Sias|title=Clay-court specialists not so special anymore|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/story/2012-04-16/weekly-net-post-demise-of-the-clay-court-specialist/54319198/1|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrero reached the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] Final in [[2003 US Open – Men's Singles|2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Ferrero shatters Agassi hopes  | publisher = BBC  | date = 27 June 2008  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/us_open_2003/3087014.stm  | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he won the [[2003 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]], and also won several hardcourt tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Ferrero claims Madrid title  | publisher = BBC  | date = 19 October 2002  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3205848.stm  | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadal was considered a clay court specialist until a string of successes on other surfaces, including completing a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Golden Slam|golden career grand slam]], led to a broadening of his reputation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/us-open-final-nadal-v-djokovic/4947782 US Open: Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic in four-set final to win his second Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 10 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while [[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|2016 French Open]] winner [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] reached the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2015 Wimbledon]] final and won the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2017 Wimbledon]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-07-09/magical_muguruza_into_first_major_final.html|title=Magical Muguruza into first major final|publisher=Wimbledon|first=Matt|last=Trollope|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional tournaments played on clay==
The professional clay court season comprises many more tournaments than the brief grass court season, but is still shorter than the hard court seasons. There are three distinct clay court seasons during the year.

The first is the men's winter clay season consisting of tournaments in South America. Played primarily in February between the [[Australian Open]] and the [[Indian Wells Masters]], the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] has four tournaments in this swing, although other ATP tournaments played on hardcourt occur the same weeks. The WTA discontinued its participation in Rio de Janeiro after 2016, so there are no clay court women's tournaments during this period.

The second is the long spring clay season that starts in the Americas and Morocco before moving to mainland Europe and finishing with the French Open. It is usually played over two months between April and June, after the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]]. Unlike the other two clay seasons this swing does not share the majority of its time with simultaneous hard court tournaments.

The third is the brief summer clay season that takes place after Wimbledon. It is entirely in Europe, and usually takes place in July. Near the end of the swing, it overlaps with the beginning of the [[US Open Series]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">'''Closed kinetic chain exercises''' or '''closed chain exercises''' (CKC) are [[physical exercise]]s performed where the [[hand]] (for arm movement) or [[foot]] (for leg movement) is fixed in space and cannot move. The extremity remains in constant contact with the immobile surface, usually the ground or the base of a machine.

The opposite of CKC exercises are [[open kinetic chain exercises]] (OKC).

Closed chain exercises are often compound movements, that generally incur compressive forces, while open-chain exercises are often isolation movements that promote more shearing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Electromyographic evaluation of closed and open kinetic chain knee rehabilitation exercises. Graham VL, Gehlsen GM, Edwards JA. J Athl Train. 1993 Spring;28(1):23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

CKC exercises involve more than one muscle group and joint simultaneously rather than concentrating solely on one, as many OKC exercises do (single-joint movements), lending the former to more utilitarian and athletic activities.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between open and closed kinetic chain strength of the lower limb and jumping performance. Blackburn JR, Morrissey MC. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 1998 Jun;27(6):430-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Closed-kinetic chain upper-body training improves throwing performance of NCAA Division I softball players. Prokopy MP, Ingersoll CD, Nordenschild E, Katch FI, Gaesser GA, Weltman A. J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Nov;22(6):1790-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
These exercises are typically [[weight bearing]] exercises, where an exerciser uses one's own body weight and/ or external weight.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19034">There are several '''concerns and controversies''' related to the [[42nd Chess Olympiad]], which took place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], from 1–14 September 2016. 

== Before the Olympiad ==
=== Anti-cheating measures ===
{{see also|Cheating in chess}}
Mindful particularly of the cheating incident of [[Sébastien Feller]] at the [[39th Chess Olympiad]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2012/FIDE/FIDE_Ethics_Commission_Judgement_in_the_case_French_Team.pdf FIDE Ethics Commission judgement 2/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the general increase of cheating incidents, the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) strove to have greatly enhanced security in Baku. Some of these were already introduced at the [[Chess World Cup 2015]] (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random security checks of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players at the entrance of the playing hall (see below).&lt;ref name="anti-cheating"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2016/FIDE_News/Olympiad/Anti_Cheating_measures_and_procedure_for_Baku_42_World_Chess_Olympiad.pdf |title=Anti Cheating Procedures — 42nd Chess Olympiad, Baku, Azerbaijan, 1–14 September 2016 |publisher=FIDE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, [[Israel Gelfer]] (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) said that the issue of anti-cheating became important in the last couple of years, with the development of [[Telecommunication|telecommunication technologies]] (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9609-interview-with-the-fide-vice-president-israel-gelfer.html Interview with Israel Gelfer] (FIDE)&lt;/ref&gt; The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30-40 checks ''during the round''; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.&lt;ref name="anti-cheating" /&gt; Both of these later came into difficulties with their implementation (see below).

=== Visas ===
Due to a small number of embassies, [[Azerbaijan]] can be more difficult to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and [[Azad Rahimov]] noted the country had a positive experience with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem.&lt;ref name=minutes2012&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2012/Congress/Minutes_of_FIDE_General_Assembly_2012.pdf Minutes 2012 FIDE General Assembly] (Page 49)&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan [[Ilham Aliyev]] signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country’s international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azertag.az/en/xeber/Simplification_of_visa_procedures_for_foreigners_arriving_for_World_Chess_Olympiad-944094 |title=Simplification of visa procedures for foreigners arriving for World Chess Olympiad |publisher=AzerTAc |date=19 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, it was unclear whether any non-attendees (see below) were absent for specifically this reason.

=== Armenian withdrawal ===
[[File:Levon Aronian 2011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Levon Aronian missed the Olympiad as Armenia chose not to participate]]
Armenia's participation in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in [[Istanbul]] in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find it quite difficult to play in Baku.&lt;ref name=minutes2012 /&gt;

Historically this is nothing new, as the tense relations between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] because of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting in the absence of players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the [[World Chess Championship 2012]] was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to [[Kazan]], with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's [[Levon Aronian]] was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.chessbase.com/post/fide-to-move-candidates-matches-topalov-threatens-boycott FIDE to move Candidates matches] (ChessBase, Kommersant)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 [[World Team Chess Championship]] in [[Tsaghkadzor]], and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the [[2014 European Individual Chess Championship|European Individual Chess Championship 2014]] in Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/en/node/17991 |title=Azerbaijan To Miss World Team Championship in Armenia |publisher=Chess-News |date=29 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eicc2014.am/content/players |title=European Individual Chess Championship 2014 — List of Participants |publisher=EICC 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 [[Chess World Cup]] in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Sports&amp;title=the-baku-world-cup-starts&amp;id=115399 |title=The Baku World Cup starts |author=Bobby Ang |publisher=[[BusinessWorld]] |date=17 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/139394/armenian-chess-grand-master-to-participate-in-world-cup-in-baku/ |title=Armenian Chess Grand Master To Participate in World Cup in Baku |publisher=[[Asbarez]] |date=2 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, during his visit to Yerevan, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the [[Chess Federation of Armenia|Armenian Chess Federation]] chairman [[Serzh Sargsyan]] (also [[President of Armenia]]), he heard no refusal about their participation. The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation [[Smbat Lputian]] responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armenianow.com/en/sports/chess/2016/05/25/armenia-chess-ilyumzhinov-baku-olympiad-armenians-participation/3866/ |title=FIDE Chief: Armenians to participate in Baku Chess Olympiad |publisher=[[ArmeniaNow]] |date=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/855185/armenian-chess-team-not-to-participate-in-world-chess-olympiad-in-baku.html |title=Armenian chess team not to participate in World Chess Olympiad in Baku |publisher=[[Armenpress]] |date=25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other federation difficulties===
====Pakistan====
One week before the Olympiad started, the Pakistani Sports Board, dealing with three separate claimants to status of official national federation, refused to issue "No Objection Certificates" (NOCs). A spokesman said, "we have refused to issue NOCs to around 15 men and women chess players and two officials as currently no chess federation is recognised by us. Issuing them NOCs will mean we’ve accepted an illegal body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://pakobserver.net/psb-springs-into-action-to-stop-departure-of-chess-team-to-azerbaijan |title= PSB Spring into action to stop departure |newspaper= [[Pak Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, a team from Pakistan (with its top players) did attend and finished slightly above average.&lt;ref name="teams-open"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess-results.com/tnr232875.aspx?lan=1&amp;art=0&amp;flag=30&amp;wi=821&amp;zeilen=99999 |title=42nd Olympiad Baku 2016 Open |publisher=Chess-Results }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
Kenya has had a long running dispute within its federation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2016/FIDE_News/GA_Agenda_2016/Annex_62.pdf 2016 FIDE General Assembly] (Annex 62)&lt;/ref&gt; and due to this and other reasons (see below) the open team ended up not showing up for the event and the women's team began play only in round 5.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/bad-day-for-number-ones-russia-and-two-world-champs-struggle-8946 Round 4 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other non-attendees ===
====Israel====
Israel participated without [[Boris Gelfand]], [[Emil Sutovsky]], and [[Ilya Smirin]] due to a dispute with the Israel Chess Federation management. The hardships were already evident in 2015, when the country failed to send a team at the [[European Team Chess Championship]] due to monetary difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/en/node/20436 Israeli Team Won't Come to Reykjavik Despite All Efforts to Raise Funds] (Chess News)&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Gelfand, who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads (1998-2014), said the management of the Israel Chess Federation have "absolutely forgotten about such things as the prestige of the country". Emil Sutovsky claimed on his [[Facebook]] page that the dispute was about "showing who’s boss rather than money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/gelfand-on-missing-the-baku-olympiad |title=Gelfand on missing the Baku Olympiad |publisher=[[Chess24.com]] |date=2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria played without [[Ivan Cheparinov]] and [[Kiril Georgiev]], the former due to monetary disputes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqsjNz7WcAAc1lL.jpg JPEG from Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.fide.com/images/stories/Ethics_Decision_case_4_2015.pdf FIDE Ethics case 4/2015] (also mentions national court situation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segabg.com/article.php?id=822736 The court decides who is right/wrong in chess] (Bulgarian). The issue was addressed by Bulgarian courts who concluded the ban was improper, but that decision is under appeal. After the FIDE General Assembly (following the Ethics Commission) voted to ban the Bulgarian Chess Federation if no action was taken, the ban was then lifted.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Veselin Topalov]] left midway through the event to attend to his pregnant wife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/SilvioDanailov/status/773434604283977728 Twitter] (Silvio Danailov)&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 [[European Team Chess Championship]]), as was [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/217627 Armenian team won't participate in Baku-hosted Chess Olympiad ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individuals====
Other than the above, the most prominent individual not participating was [[Vishwanathan Anand]], who has not represented [[India]] since 2006. [[Vassily Ivanchuk]] from [[Ukraine]] was absent for the first time since 1988, choosing to play in a [[draughts]] tournament instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/who-is-and-who-isn-t-playing-the-olympiad-7202 Who is and isn't playing the Olympiad] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

== During the Olympiad ==
=== African nations ===
A number of African nations did not show up in time, for various reasons such as difficulties flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later).&lt;ref name=chesscom-r2&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/carlsen-succeeds-with-new-first-move-in-second-round-olympiad-4273 Round 2 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4/&gt;

=== Lack of security measures ===
Despite the aforementioned anti-cheating protocols, some participants felt that this was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of [[FIDE]] President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]].&lt;ref name=chesscom-r2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=colovic&gt;[http://www.alexcolovic.com/2016/09/anti-cheating-in-baku.html Anti-Cheating in Baku] (Alex Colovic)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecforum.org.uk/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8196&amp;start=45#p188290 English Chess Federation post] (Nick Faulks, Bermuda)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/772169876257538049 Twitter] (Pavel Eljanov, Twitter)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/772170556720513024 Twitter] (Part 2 of previous)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complaints on anti-cheating measures ===
A significant petition was circulated by [[Jonathan Speelman]] and others regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits).&lt;ref name=petition&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/olympiad-protest-at-anti-cheating-toilet-rule |title=Olympiad protest at “anti-cheating” toilet rule |publisher=Chess24.com |date=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/grandmasters-meet-as-olympiad-heats-up-in-baku-7145 Round 3 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given for this protesting against this "noxious" rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet is part of the playing area; an indication it was "humiliating" for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and embarrassing for the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit.&lt;ref name=petition /&gt; The response by Chief Arbiter [[Faiq Hasanov]] noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that "common sense" should apply.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4 /&gt;

[[File:Nigel Short 2013.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nigel Short received official warning for refusing to undergo a check during a game]]

During the game of the seventh round between [[Nigel Short]] and [[Li Chao (chess player)|Li Chao]], the former was returning from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices.&lt;ref name=CNshort&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/node/22012 Nigel Short refused an arbiter] (Chess-News, Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/usa-russia-double-feature-russian-men-escape-with-draw-women-not-as-lucky-8773 Round 8 report] (Chess.com, updating the Short story)&lt;/ref&gt; Short discussed the event extensively after the event, indicating that he did not think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit has in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device).&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/Nigel+Short+calls+anti-cheating+rule+%E2%80%9Canti-chess%E2%80%9D Nigel Short calls anti-cheating rule "anti-chess"] (Chess24, Interview with Nigel Short)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldAYecXObPA A quick chat with Nigel Short in Baku 2016] (Youtube video, Daniel King)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Short also mentioned the fact he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the [[Solomon Islands]]) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations).&lt;ref name=CNshort /&gt; Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters "ask[ing] him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" while in time trouble and playing a "do-or-die" position, though these details now seem discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.chessbase.com/post/2016-baku-rd7-the-day-the-giants-fell Round 7 report] (ChessBase, Albert Silver)&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple post-event comments by captains and players continued to report the annoyance of the anti-cheating measures, noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chessexpress.blogspot.com.au/2016/09/back-from-baku.html Back from Baku] (Shaun Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/korobov-i-decided-to-return-to-this-factory Interview with Anton Korobov] (Chess24)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baadur Jobava]] was prominent on the other side of the issue, opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great "headache" for the 21st century chess player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/baadur.jobava/posts/10210094420054518 Facebook post] (Baadur Jobava)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese player forfeited ===
In the fourth round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was forfeited after he was caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in a change in the match score. Chief Arbiter [[Faiq Hasanov]] said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating ''per se'', Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4 /&gt; The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the [[Association of Chess Professionals]] Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;

[[Image:Cummerbund1950.JPG|thumb|300px|Black [[Ottoman (textile)|ottoman]] silk cummerbund, for [[black tie]]]]
[[File:Denzel Washington.jpg|thumb|300px|A cummerbund worn by the man at the back-center.]]

A '''cummerbund''' ({{Lang-fa|کمربند|kamarband}}) is a broad waist [[sash]], usually [[pleat]]ed, which is often worn with single-breasted [[dinner jacket]]s (or ''tuxedos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Villarosa | last2 = Angeli | year = 1990 | title = The Elegant Man: How to Construct the Ideal Wardrobe | page = 148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cummerbund is a [[Persia|Persian]]-origin garment that was used by ancient people in Persia (Cummer = cammar which means waist and band means belt, but that word as well as some other Persian words were used in India) which was first adopted by [[British Empire|British]] military officers in [[colonial India]] when they were exposed to [[Indian people|Indian]] men wearing it. It was adopted as an alternative to a [[waistcoat]], and later spread to civilian use. The modern use of the cummerbund to Europeans is as a component of a traditional [[black tie]] event.

==Etymology==
The word ''cummerbund'' is the Anglicized form of ''kamarband'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]: कमरबंद; {{Nastaliq|کمربند}}), the name commonly used in the South and West Asia including India for the article of clothing. It entered [[English vocabulary]] in 1616 from India. It is a combination of the Hindustani words ({{transl|fa|kamar}}) meaning 'waist'&lt;ref&gt;http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-कमर-in-english.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915061944/http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B0-in-english.html |date=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ({{transl|fa|band}}) meaning 'strap' or 'lacing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#auto/hi/band|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915230747/https://translate.google.com/#auto/hi/band|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'waist-band' was a sash accessory worn by Indian men for many occasions.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} (Before the British colonial presence, Persian was one of the court languages in India, hence the Persian influence).

The word ''cummerband'' (see below), and less commonly the German spelling {{lang|de|Kummerbund}} (a Germanized spelling variation of the English word), are often used synonymously with ''cummerbund'' in English. Today, the word {{transl|fa|kamarband}} in Persian refers to anything which is or works like a belt, be it a [[Belt (clothing)|clothing belt]], a [[safety belt]] or a ring road around a city center ({{lang|fa|کمربندی|rtl=yes}}).

==Description==
The form of the cummerbund is a wide band around the waist, and its origin as part of black tie determined the acceptable colours.  Once it was adopted as civilian dress, beginning as a largely summer option with informal dinner jackets, such as Burmese fawn and white, it was restricted to the narrow range of colours which accompany black tie. These were predominantly black, sometimes midnight blue to match the trousers, and occasionally maroon (the normal hue for coloured accessories).  The pleats face up because they were originally used to hold ticket stubs and similar items,&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;Bridges, John  (2008). ''How to be a Gentleman: A Timely Guide to Timeless Manners'' Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed | date = November 2013}} explaining the slang name 'crumb-catcher'. However, the cummerbunds worn as part of the US Army Blue Mess and Blue Evening Mess uniforms are worn with the pleats down, as prescribed by Army Regulation 670–1 Chapter 24 Section 10(b).  But, per US Navy Uniform Regulations NAVPERS 15665, the cummerbund is worn with the pleats up for the Navy Dinner Dress Jacket.  The contemporary use of the cummerbund is purely aesthetic, providing a transition between the shirt and the waistband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Alan Flusser| last = Flusser | first = Alan | year = 2002 | title = Dressing the Man | page = 246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fastening is a ribbon around the back, tied or held shut by a buckle or [[velcro]].

In contemporary use, it is now common to see coloured bow ties and cummerbands, often matching, but this is considered non-traditional.&lt;ref name="Bridges"/&gt; They have also expanded in less formal situations into use with components of white tie, particularly by musicians, who sometimes wear a white cummerbund instead of the traditional [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] waistcoat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Walroth | first = Chris | date = March 2001 | title = Behind | url = http://thewholenote.com/wholenote_mar_01/behind.html | newspaper = The Wholenote Magazine | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215043139/http://thewholenote.com/wholenote_mar_01/behind.html | archivedate = 15 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military cummerbunds ==
[[File:French Foreign Legion dsc06878.jpg|thumb|150px|The cummerbund of the [[French Foreign Legion]] is blue.]]
The units of the [[Army of Africa (France)|French Army of Africa]] (such as the [[Zouaves]] or the [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]]) wore cummerbunds of 2 different colours: blue for European soldiers and red for Native recruits. Some current French regiments, related to the [[French colonial empire|French colonial history]], still retain cummerbunds as part of their full dress uniform (notably the French Foreign Legion and the [[Spahi]]s).

Similar to the cummerbund, a '''cummerband''' is an accessory to the dress uniform used extensively in modern South Asian armies including [[Indian Army]] and [[Bangladesh Army]] and others. It is generally worn during ceremonial parades and dinners. The colour or combination of colours varies widely according to regiment or corps.  Unlike the civilian cummerbund, a leather belt is worn above this cloth piece and one end hangs free displaying an ornamental fringe.

== Athletic cummerbunds ==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, cotton cummerbunds were commonly worn by athletes participating in [[gymnastic]] and/or [[combat sport]] training and competition.

== Cummerbunds in scuba diving ==
A ''commerbund'' is also an informal word used in scuba diving to mean a wide waistband either on a [[buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy control device]] designed to provide more comfort to the user than a standard waistband and usually made of a stout fabric backed with velcro fastenings, or on a two-piece [[dry suit]] where a flexible rubber waistband helps to maintain a watertight seal between the jacket and the pants of the suit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14119">{{short description| Aspects of physics which affect the underwater diver }}
'''Diving physics''' are the aspects of [[physics]] which directly affect the [[Underwater diving|underwater diver]] and  which explain the effects that divers and their equipment are subject to underwater which differ from the normal human experience out of water.

These effects are mostly consequences of immersion in water, the hydrostatic pressure of depth and the effects of the pressure on breathing gases. An understanding of the physics is useful when considering the physiological effects of diving and the [[List of diving hazards and precautions|hazards and risks of diving]].

== Laws of physics with particular reference to diving ==
[[File:Buoyancy corr.svg|thumb|upright=2 ]]
The main [[laws of physics]] that describe the influence of the [[underwater diving]] environment on the diver and [[diving equipment]] are:
* Archimedes' Principle ([[Buoyancy]]) - Ignoring the minor effect of surface tensions, an object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.  Thus, when in water (a fluid), the weight of the volume of water displaced as compared to the weight of the materials in the diver's body and in the diver's equipment, determine whether the diver floats or sinks.&lt;ref name=acott /&gt;&lt;ref name=buoyancy /&gt; Buoyancy control, and being able to maintain neutral buoyancy in particular, is an important safety skill. The diver needs to understand buoyancy to be able to effectively and safely operate [[drysuit]]s, [[buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]]s, [[diving weighting system]]s and [[lifting bag]]s.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;
* [[Boyle's law]] - as pressure changes, the volume of gases in the diver's body and soft equipment changes too.&lt;ref name=acott/&gt; The volume of gas in a non-rigid container (such as a diver's [[lungs]] or buoyancy compensation device), decreases as external pressure increases while the diver descends in the water. Likewise, the volume of gas in such non-rigid containers increases on the ascent. Changes in the volume of gases in the diver and the diver's equipment affect buoyancy. This creates a [[positive feedback loop]] on both ascent and descent. The quantity of open circuit gas breathed by a diver increases with pressure and depth.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Gay-Lussac's Law#Pressure-temperature law|Gay-Lussac's second law]] – as temperature increases the pressure in a [[diving cylinder]] increases (originally described by [[Guillaume Amontons]]).&lt;ref name="Amontons'law" /&gt; This is why a diver who enters cold water with a warm diving cylinder, for instance after a recent quick [[diving air compressor|fill]], finds the gas pressure of the cylinder drops by an unexpectedly large amount during the early part of the dive as the gas in the cylinder cools.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;
* [[Dalton's law]] - in mixtures of [[breathing gas]]es the concentration of the individual components of the gas mix is proportional to their [[partial pressure]]&lt;ref name=acott/&gt; Partial pressure is a useful measure for expressing limits for avoiding [[nitrogen narcosis]] and [[oxygen toxicity]].&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt; 
* [[Henry's law]] - as pressure increases the quantity of gas absorbed by the [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the human body increases.&lt;ref name=henrys /&gt; This mechanism is involved in nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity and [[decompression sickness]].&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Snell's law]] - the index of [[refraction]] of water is similar to that of the [[cornea]] of the [[human eye|eye]]—30% greater than air.&lt;ref name=snells /&gt; This is the reason a diver cannot see clearly underwater without a [[diving mask]] with an internal airspace.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;

== Physical characteristics of water most relevant to divers ==
[[File:NOAA Deep Light diagram3.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Comparison of penetration of light of different wavelengths in the open ocean and coastal waters]]
The physical effects of water or the [[underwater]] environment are:
* [[Pressure]] - the overall pressure on a diver is the sum of the local [[atmospheric pressure]] and [[hydrostatic pressure]].&lt;ref name=pressure /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Density]] - of the water, the diver's body and equipment determines the diver's buoyancy and the use of buoyant equipment.&lt;ref name=density /&gt; and density is a factor in the generation of hydrostatic pressure. Divers use high density materials such as [[lead]] for diving weighting systems and low density materials such as [[Density of air|air]] in buoyancy compensators and lifting bags.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Thermal conductivity]] of water is higher than that of air.&lt;ref name=thermal /&gt; As water conducts heat 20 times more than air, divers in cold water must insulate their bodies with [[diving suit]]s to avoid [[hypothermia]]. Gases used in diving have very different thermal conductivity; [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] conducts heat more than air and [[argon]] conducts less heat than air hence the reason many trimix divers inflate their drysuits with argon.&lt;ref name=IEEE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=argon /&gt;
* [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|Absorption of light]] and loss of [[colour]] underwater.&lt;ref name=Luria /&gt;&lt;ref name=light /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The red end of the [[spectrum of light]] is absorbed even in shallow water.&lt;ref name=Luria/&gt; Divers use artificial light underwater to reveal these absorbed colours. In deeper water no light from the surface penetrates.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* Under pressure, [[gas]]es are [[compressibility|highly compressible]] but [[liquids]] are almost incompressible. Air spaces in the diver's body and gas held in flexible equipment contract as the diver descends and expand as the diver ascends.&lt;ref name=compression /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* The absolute (dynamic) [[viscosity]] of water is higher (order of 100 times) than that of air.&lt;ref name="Dougherty and Franzini 1877" /&gt; This increases the drag on an object moving through water, and it requires more effort for propulsion in water relative to the speed of movement.

== Physical phenomena of interest to divers ==
[[File:THERMOCLINE.png|thumb |upright=1.2|Graph showing a tropical ocean thermocline (depth vs. temperature)]]
The physical phenomena found in large bodies of water that may have a practical influence on divers include:
* Effects of [[weather]] such as [[wind]], which causes [[Wind wave|waves]], and changes of [[temperature]] and atmospheric pressure on and in the water. Even moderately high winds can prevent diving because of the increased risk of becoming lost at sea or injured. Low water temperatures make it necessary for divers to wear diving suits and can cause problems such as freezing of [[diving regulator]]s.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Halocline]]s, or strong, vertical [[salinity]] gradients. For instance where fresh water enters the sea, the fresh water floats over the denser saline water and may not mix immediately. Sometimes visual effects, such as shimmering and reflection, occur at the boundary between the layers, because the refractive indices differ.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;
* [[Ocean currents]] can transport water over thousands of kilometres, and may bring water with different temperature and salinity into a region. Some ocean currents have a huge effect on local climate, for instance the warm water of the [[North Atlantic drift]] moderates the climate of the north west coast of Europe. The speed of water movement can affect dive planning and safety.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* [[Thermocline]]s, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;
* Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt; 
* In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;
* Water at near-freezing temperatures is less dense than slightly warmer water - maximum density of water is at about 4°C - so when near freezing, water may be slightly warmer at depth than at the surface.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;
* [[Tides|Tidal]] currents and changes in sea level caused by [[Gravity|gravitational]] forces and the [[earth's rotation]]. Some dive sites can only be dived safely at [[slack water]] when the tidal cycle reverses and the current slows. Strong currents can cause problems for divers. Buoyancy control can be difficult when a strong current meets a vertical surface. Divers consume more breathing gas when swimming against currents. Divers on the surface can be separated from their boat cover by currents. On the other hand, [[drift diving]] is only possible when there is a reasonable current.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001"  /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

In [[sports]], an '''ejection''' (also known as '''dismissal''', '''sending-off''', or '''disqualification''') is the removal of a participant from a contest due to a violation of the sport's rules. The exact violations that lead to an ejection vary depending upon the sport, but common causes for ejection include [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], violent acts against another participant that are beyond the sport's generally accepted standards for such acts, abuse against officials, violations of the sport's rules that the contest official deems to be egregious, or the use of an illegal substance to better a player's game. Most sports have provisions that allow players to be ejected, and many allow for the ejection of coaches, managers, or other non-playing personnel.

The decision to eject a participant usually lies with one or more officials present at the contest (e.g., referees or umpires). In addition to removal from the contest, many sports leagues provide additional sanctions against participants who have been ejected, such as monetary fines or suspensions from future contests.

When the offender is ejected, he/she must leave the immediate playing area; in most cases, this means going to the locker room or other part of the venue out of sight of the playing area, or in extreme cases, leaving the facility grounds. In many youth sports leagues, ejected players are required to stay with their coach in the team area, or at least be supervised by an adult at whatever location the player is required to go. If a participant refuses to cooperate with an ejection, additional sanctions may be levied, such as forfeiture of the contest, monetary fines, or suspensions.

==Conditions==

===Basketball===
In the [[NBA]] and most other [[basketball]] games, a player or coach is ejected from the game if he accumulates two [[technical foul]]s of an unsportsmanlike nature over the course of the game. Participants who commit [[Flagrant foul|fouls of violence]] or intentionally enter the stands are ejected summarily regardless of the number of technical fouls accumulated. Ejected players/coaches must leave the court area for the remainder of play, and must do so immediately, or else risk even heavier fines/suspensions. In the NBA, an ejection will result in, at minimum, a $1,000 fine; an ejection for leaving the bench during a fight carries at least a one-game suspension as well. In domestic games, refusing to leave after being ejected can result in a player being put on report. If being put on report does not provide enough encouragement for a player to leave the court, the official may [[wiktionary:forfeit|award the game to the opposing team]], regardless of score. Players who incur 16 technical fouls in a single NBA season are automatically suspended for one game; an additional suspension is imposed for each increment of two thereafter. Should a player receive the 16th technical foul in the last regular-season game, he will be suspended for the first game in the next season, unless if his team is in the playoffs, when he will be suspended for the first playoff game. In the playoffs, players are suspended if they receive seven technical fouls.

A significant rule change was made in 1981 whereby the NBA eliminated the ejection of a coach for three technical fouls caused by an [[Defensive Three-Second Violation|illegal defense]].  Also, in the NBA ejections and suspensions are not permissible if a technical foul is caused by an excessive timeout, delay of game, accidental departure from the coach's box, the destruction of a backboard caused by a play (such as a dunk), defensive hanging on any part of the basket unit to successfully touch a ball (Rule 12), or any remaining in the game after six fouls when a team is out of players because of fouls, injuries, and ejections under Rule 3, Section I, paragraph b.  These technical fouls are referenced as "Non-Unsportsmanlike Conduct Technical Fouls". The NBA all-time leader in disqualifications is [[Vern Mikkelsen]], who was disqualified 127 times in 631 games.

In FIBA sanctioned games, a player is ejected for two technicals (since October 1, 2014), unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying foul.  Technical fouls in FIBA include swinging of elbows without contact and [[Flop (basketball)|flopping]], which are not fouls in the NBA.  A coach can be ejected upon having incurred two coach technical fouls, or a combination of three bench and coach technical fouls.  There is no separation regarding a "non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul," as in the NBA, so two delay of game violations result in an ejection.

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] contests, ejected players must remain on the team bench, so that they may continue to be supervised by a coach or other adult team representative. If an adult team representative other than the head coach, such as an adult assistant coach, can provide supervision from the court and to the locker room for the duration of the contest, the player may leave the visual confines of the playing area with this representative.

In NCAA contests, ejected players are dismissed to the locker room; no adult supervision is required as NCAA players are assumed to be legally of adult age.

Basketball also features disqualification, also known as fouling out.  A player who commits a certain number of [[foul (basketball)|personal foul]]s in a game (5 or 6 in most leagues), is removed from the game and is said to have "fouled out".  Unlike ejection, disqualification is not considered a punitive action but rather a natural consequence of a very physical sport with many instances of contact. Disqualified players are permitted to remain on the bench with the team (instead of being sent to the locker room, as with an ejected player) and are not subject to any further penalties (such as fines or suspensions); they can resume play in their next game. In the NBA, a technical foul (which does not count towards suspension or ejection) is also assessed for re-entering a game after fouling out of a game in emergency situations listed in Rule 3, Section I when a team is reduced to five players.  Once that occurs, a technical foul is charged if a player remains in the game after his sixth or subsequent foul, or as the last player to foul out, re-enters the game in case of injury to an eligible player that must be removed.

===Baseball===
{{see also|Major League Baseball umpiring records#Ejections}}
[[Image:Scott steinmann ejected.jpg|thumb|250px|Despite having been ejected, manager of the [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers]] Scott Steinmann continues to argue with umpire Nicholas Nolde.]]
In baseball, each umpire has a considerable amount of discretion, and may eject any player, [[coach (baseball)|coach]], or [[manager (baseball)|manager]] solely on his own judgment of [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="901d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.01(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ejectable offense may be an excessively heated or offensive argument with an umpire, [[interference (baseball)|offensive interference]] (contact with the catcher on a play at the plate), malicious game play (especially pitchers [[Beanball|attempting to intentionally strike batters with the ball]] or a manager or coach [[Hit by pitch|ordering a pitcher to do so]]),&lt;ref name="802d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 8.02(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule8.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; illegally applying a foreign substance to a bat or otherwise tampering with a ball (most famously, [[George Brett]]'s [[Pine Tar Game]]),&lt;ref name="802a"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 8.02(a) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule8.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[corked bat]],&lt;ref name="606d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 6.06(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule6.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[charging the mound]], or otherwise fighting. Between players and umpires, there is a common understanding that a certain level of argument is permitted, but players who too vigorously question an umpire's judgment of balls and strikes,&lt;ref name="902a"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.02(a) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or argue a [[balk]], may risk an ejection. A player is also automatically ejected when a bat, glove, cap or helmet is taken off and thrown down in anger and/or confusion.

Persons other than players, coaches and managers, such as spectators, ballpark staff, or members of the media, may be ejected at an umpire's discretion.&lt;ref name="901e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.01(e) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the circumstances, spectators who are ejected may also face arrest and prosecution. Bat boys and ball boys may be ejected for not wearing proper safety equipment.&lt;ref name="116e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 1.16(e) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an ejection is followed by a fine or a suspension by the league if the player, or manager or coach, reacts in a very hostile manner towards the umpire. Also, any ejection for malicious game play will normally result in a suspension. Some managers will engage in arguments with umpires specifically to provoke an ejection, in hopes of inspiring a rally from their team. Former [[Atlanta Braves]] manager [[Bobby Cox]] holds the MLB record for most ejections with 161 while Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] holds the record for most ejections by an umpire with 251.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closecallsports.com/2011/08/polls-she-gone.html|title=Umpire Ejection Fantasy League Polls: He Gone|work=Close Call Sports|date=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball has a rich vocabulary for describing ejections: a player or coach may also be "run", "thrown out", "banned", "given the ol' heave-ho", "sent to the clubhouse", "hit the showers", "tossed", "kicked out", "dumped", "sent off", "pitched", "bounced out", "canned", "chucked", or "booted". The umpire can signal an ejection by pointing to the dugout or waving his arm toward the dugout in a “throwing” motion, usually yelling at the ejected person to leave. Fans of a home team usually cheer when a player from the visiting team is ejected. Managers or other players usually come out of the dugout and push the offending player away so as to keep them from getting into more trouble with the umpire. Managers often are simultaneously ejected when attempting to protect a player or otherwise leaving the dugout during play. Once an ejection is called, the ejected person and other associated people usually continue yelling at the umpire, with more anger. This is colloquially known as “getting your money’s worth”.

===American football===
Any player or team official who commits a personal foul (i.e. striking, kicking, kneeing) against another player or team official, commits an act of [[American football rules|unnecessary roughness]] against another player or team official, commits an act of unsportsmanlike conduct, or commits a [[palpably unfair act]] is liable to be disqualified from further participation if the act is found to be flagrant. Any player or team official who fights with another player or team official, leaves the bench to take part in a fight, intentionally makes contact with or assaults a game official, or uses any item of equipment as a weapon is automatically disqualified.

Compared to other American sports (perhaps with the exception of [[basketball]]), ejections in American football are relatively uncommon considering the physical nature of the sport.  If a player or team official is disqualified, his/her team is assessed a 15-yard penalty, but if a player or team official is disqualified for a palpably unfair act, the distance or score penalty will be determined by the referee after consultation with the other officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/penaltysummaries|title=NFL Rules Digest: Summary of Penalties|author=|date=|website=www.nfl.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Football League]] (NFL) made an experimental rule change on March 23, 2016 for the following season stating that two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on a player would result in an automatic ejection from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000646837/article/nfl-passes-automatic-ejection-rule-for-2016-season|title=NFL passes automatic ejection rule for 2016 season|author=|date=|website=nfl.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some coaches have expressed concern that this could result in a player with one such penalty being goaded by the opposing team into a second penalty to get them removed from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2627124-coaches-fear-the-nfls-new-ejection-rule-could-lead-to-the-goon-scenario|title=Coaches Fear the NFL's New Ejection Rule Could Lead to 'The Goon Scenario'|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=|website=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school football]], a player or team official is automatically disqualified if he/she receives two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the same game. In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|college football]], a player is automatically disqualified if he/she is determined to have led with the crown of his/her helmet, or targeted a defenseless player in his/her head or neck area. In addition, if said infraction is committed in the second half of a game, the player is suspended for the first half of the following game.

===Association football===
[[File:Cartonrouge.jpg|right|thumb|A red card, signifying ejection from a match|alt=An arm and hand, extended upward, with a black sweatband around the wrist holding a small red square plastic card by its bottom corner]]
{{Main|Fouls and misconduct (association football)}}
In association football, a player is dismissed from the field of play by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] showing him/her a red card if (s)he commits a dismissible offence or has committed a second cautionable ([[Yellow card (sports)|yellow card]]) offence having already received a yellow card in the same game. The act of ejection is referred to in the sport as "sending off".

A difference between being dismissed in association football and the above-mentioned sports is that in association football, a player may not be replaced, forcing his/her team to play a man down for the remainder of the match. Additionally, a dismissal in any professional league results in an automatic suspension of at least one match.

It is also possible for the [[Manager (association football)|manager]] or other team official to be "sent off", which requires him/her to leave his/her [[Dugout (football)|dugout]] and sit in the stands away from the touch line. This usually requires another member of the coaching staff to make decisions for the team, such as substitutes and [[Formation (association football)|formation]]. Also, depending upon the rules of the association presiding over the game, the manager or team official may not be allowed on the bench or to communicate with assistants for at least his/her team's next game.

If the same team has 5 players who have been "sent off", the match is then "abandoned", that is, the game no longer continues. The officials then file a game report with the appropriate league or association. The league or associatation then decides if a forfeit will be assessed and what the final score is recorded as.

According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', the most red cards administered in one game is 20, for a match between [[Paraguay]]an teams [[Sportivo Ameliano]] and [[General Caballero Sport Club|General Caballero]] that broke down into a generalized brawl and was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/28/theknowledge.sport|title=The most red cards in a game... ever!|first=Sean|last=Ingle|date=28 January 2002|website=the Guardian|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby football===
In all codes of rugby, a player may be temporarily suspended for a period of the match. In [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], the standard suspension period is 10 minutes (out of an 80-minute game). This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the [[sin bin]] and is signalled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a [[penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union.

In [[rugby sevens|rugby union sevens]], which normally lasts 14 minutes (20 in finals), the suspension period is 2 minutes. While eight minutes shorter than in fifteens, suspensions are more severe in sevens as one seventh of the team is out for one seventh of the match; this opens up more space than losing one fifteenth of the team for one eighth of the match.

Temporary suspensions are usually given for repeated infringements (by either the same player or team), [[professional foul]]s and foul play, such as high tackles. A player cannot be replaced while temporarily suspended, though may be at the conclusion of the suspension period. For more serious offences or a second infraction warranting a temporary suspension sanction, a player may be sent off for the rest of the game, with no replacement allowable.

Special conditions exist in rugby union for the replacement of a sinbinned or sent-off front-row forward.

Referees also have the power to send team officials to the stands, similar to that in football.

===Cricket===
Prior to 2017, there was no provision in the Laws for a player to be ejected, although post-game disciplinary action could occur.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2000"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Laws of Cricket 2000 Code, 6th Edition (2016) |url=https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/MCC-Laws-of-Cricket-2000-Code-6th-Edition-2016.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616170646/https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/MCC-Laws-of-Cricket-2000-Code-6th-Edition-2016.pdf |archivedate=2018-06-16 |pages=52–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was however, provision in the Laws (Law 42 prior to 2017, now Law 41) for umpires to suspend a bowler from bowling in the remainder of his team's innings, detailed below.

The [[Laws of Cricket]] 2017 Code introduced a new Law (Law 42) dealing with players' conduct, as by then it was widely accepted that a need existed to provide the umpires with on-field sanctions for poor conduct, and that such sanction could lead to sending off for acts of violence.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-summary"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Summary of changes to the Laws of Cricket 2017 Code |url=https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/Law-Summary-Paper-updated-28-June.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616165140/https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/Law-Summary-Paper-updated-28-June.pdf |archivedate=2018-06-16 |pages=4, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the new Law, four different levels of offences were created: a Level 3 offence (intimidating an umpire by language or gesture, or threatening to assault a player or any other person except an umpire) results in the offending player being suspended for a number of overs dependent on the length of the match, while a Level 4 offence (threatening to assault or making inappropriate or deliberate physical contact with an umpire, physically assaulting a player or any other person, or committing any other act of violence) results in the offending player being removed from the field for the remainder of the match.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-laws-42"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Law 42 - Players' Conduct |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-42-players-conduct/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001123056/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-42-players-conduct/ |archivedate=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circumstances where a players' conduct offence of any level has been committed, the umpires will halt the game, summon the offending player's captain to the field, inform the captain of the breach of Law and the associated penalty and, in the cases of a Level 3 or Level 4 offence, instruct the captain to remove the offending player from the field.  If the offending player's captain refuses to comply with an instruction to remove a player, the umpires will consider awarding the match to the opposition, or will abandon the match in a case where both captains are involved and both refuse to comply.  Furthermore, any players' conduct offence will result in a report to the Executive of the offending player’s team and to any Governing Body responsible for the match who, as was the case in the prior Laws, may take additional disciplinary action after the match.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-laws-42" /&gt;

Additionally, the umpires have the power to eject a bowler from the team's bowling attack for the remainder of the innings (or in the case of a one-innings match or the second innings of a two-innings match, the remainder of the match) if the bowler, after having received one or two prior warnings (depending on prior offences), is guilty of throwing (law 21.3), [[ball-tampering]] (law 41.3), dangerous and unfair bowling (laws 41.6 to 41.8), time wasting (law 41.9) or running onto the protected area of the pitch (law 41.13). Any bowler who is guilty of deliberately bowling a high full-pitched ball (law 41.7) is automatically ejected.  If a bowler is ejected, the umpires will direct the captain of the fielding team, once the ball is dead, to take the bowler off forthwith. If there is an over in progress when the bowler is ejected, it shall be completed by another bowler who shall neither have bowled the previous over nor be allowed to bowl the next over. The bowler thus ejected shall not bowl again in that innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Law 41 - Unfair play |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-41-unfair-play/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001121603/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-41-unfair-play/ |archivedate=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
{{See also|Penalty (ice hockey)}}
In [[ice hockey]], there are several types of ejections for penalties: a "game ejection", "game misconduct penalty", "match penalty", and formerly "gross misconduct penalty".

During games sanctioned by Hockey Canada, a "game ejection" is issued for three stick infraction penalties and is rather rare. These penalties include cross checking, high sticking, butt ending, slashing, and spearing.

A game misconduct penalty is usually issued against a player for unsportsmanlike play, escalating a [[fighting (ice hockey)|fight]], or leaving the [[penalty box]] before he has completed serving time for another penalty, although some major penalties carry an automatic game misconduct.  If a player incurs three game misconducts in a season, (s)he will be given a one-match ban.  The player must leave the ice immediately, and a substitute may take over.  However, if any other penalties are incurred by the ejected player in the same incident, they must be served in the penalty box by the substituting player.  By the USA Hockey rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Menu_RulesEquipment/2011%20-%2013%20Playing%20Rules%20Casebook.pdf |title=USA Hockey Rulebook |work=USA Hockey |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a player can receive a game misconduct for violently checking an opponent into the boards from behind, or if the opponent's head strikes the boards or the goal frame as a result of the check from behind. It is also common knowledge that a player receives a game misconduct, regardless of the force of the hit, the second time (s)he checks an opponent from behind.

A match penalty is usually issued against a player for deliberately attempting to injure another player, such as stomping on him with his/her skate or a malicious hit.  In addition to the offending player being immediately ejected (and usually subject to suspension), another player must serve a five-minute major penalty in the penalty box in addition to any other penalties imposed.  The only exception is if a match penalty is against a goaltender, in which case the replacement goaltender can enter the ice immediately and a non-goaltender player serves the penalties. Match penalties may also be automatically flagged for review and supplementary discipline, depending on the league or association.

Prior to 2000, a gross misconduct was normally issued for an action far outside the normal level of acceptable behavior and was commonly given when a player has "made a travesty of the game".

===Water polo===
An ejection is called for a hold, sink, or pullback by a defensive player. If a player commits a foul within 5 meters to the goal that prevents a probable goal the offense will be awarded a penalty shot. Ejections and penalties are also awarded due to interference of a play. For example, if an ordinary foul is called (one blast of whistle) and the defensive player continues to play on that player, an ejection will be awarded. If the player fails to make their way to the penalty box, the offensive team will be awarded a penalty shot. The replacement player may not join play until a change of possession, [[turnover (water polo)|turnover]] or once 20 seconds elapse. Should the player acquire 3 personal fouls (penalties/ejections) the player must sit out for the remainder the game. Players in the water that acquire a misconduct (shown by circular hand motions by the referee) may no longer participate in the game and must sit out for the remainder of the game. Coaches and players on the bench may be removed by being awarded a red card. For Flagrant Misconducts and Brutalities the player may no longer participate for the remainder of the game, leave the playing area, and must face the consequences following their respective rulebook (NCAA, FINA, NFHS, etc.)

===Field lacrosse===
In [[field lacrosse]], an ejection (expulsion foul) is issued for a severe penalty, such as fighting, [[bench-clearing brawl|leaving the bench to take part in a fight]], malicious hits, deliberately attempting to injure another player, blatant fouls at the end of or immediately following a game, or, in high school, receiving two unreleasable [[unsportsmanlike conduct#field lacrosse|unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalties. Coaches and team officials can also be ejected for being caught using alcohol or tobacco during a game.

The team guilty of the expulsion foul must serve a three-minute non-releasable penalty, and the ejected player/coach/official is suspended for at least the next game.

Fouling out occurs if a player incurs five minutes of personal foul penalty time (I.e. slashing, illegal body check, tripping, unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, punishable by a one to three minute penalty), but does not result in a suspension from the next game.

[[Technical foul (field lacrosse)|Technical fouls]] do not count towards the five minutes; however a player may be called for unsportsmanlike conduct if they repeatedly commit the same technical foul, in which case it would count toward fouling out.

==Additional penalties==
In some instances, a player or coach who is ejected must serve a suspension and may pay a [[fine (penalty)|fine]]. Often, the suspension is one game for the first offense, with harsher penalties depending on subsequent ejections and the severity of the offense. Sometimes in professional sports, a fine may be sanctioned against a player or coach.

Most [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] contests require ejected players to remain in the team area, so they may be supervised by a responsible team adult, usually the head or assistant coach (as requiring a minor to leave an area unsupervised can lead to legal liabilities).  If the player continues to be unruly, other solutions may be implemented such as requiring an assistant coach to leave the area with the player, handing the player over to the school administrator on duty, requiring the player's parents/legal guardians to take the player home, or more rarely, if the ejected player becomes violent, law enforcement to take them into custody.

:''See [[Kata]] for "Form" as used in the context of martial arts.''

'''Form''' is a specific way of performing a movement, often a [[strength training]] exercise, to avoid injury, prevent [[Cheating#Strength_training|cheating]] and increase strength.

=='Proper form'==
Exercises or drills in sport have a recognized way of performing the movements that have two purposes:
===Avoiding injury===
By using proper or 'good and' form, the risk of injury is lowered. A lack of proper form commonly results in injury or a lack of effect from the exercise being performed

===Maximize benefit===
Good form ensures that the movement only uses the main muscles, and avoids recruiting secondary muscles.  As a muscle fatigues, the body attempts to compensate by recruiting other muscle groups and transferring force generation to non-fatigued units.  This reduces the benefits in strength or size gain experienced by the muscles as they are not worked to failure.

'''Gate receipts''', or simply "gate," is the sum of money taken at a sporting venue for the sale of tickets.

Traditionally, gate receipts were largely or entirely taken in cash. Today, many sporting venues will operate a [[season ticket]] scheme, which will mean they allocate a proportion of season ticket moneys when announcing gate receipts for a particular event.

"Gate" is also sometimes used in reference to the number of people in attendance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">'''Groundhopping''' is a hobby that involves attending matches at as many different stadiums or grounds as possible. Participants are known as groundhoppers, hoppers or travellers. Largely a [[association football|football]]-related pastime, groundhopping probably found its origin in football in the 1970s in [[England]]. From the late 1980s fans in [[Germany]] started groundhopping as well. Currently it is especially popular in the [[United Kingdom]], Germany, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and Norway.

There is no universal set of rules for counting ‘hopped grounds’, although a generally accepted one is that a match must have been seen at the ground. 

There are some formal organisations for groundhoppers, including [[The 92 Club]] in England, which consists of groundhoppers who have visited matches in all stadiums of the [[Premier League|Premier]] and [[the Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ninety-Two Club.

A '''hand sack''' is any sack or similar object, typically made of [[cloth]] and filled with sand or a similar material, that is tossed on the back of the hand in a variety of games.

==Origin==
Hand sack originates from the lighter game, a game often played on college campuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lighter game founded in the greater Burlington Vermont area in the early 90's which spread to the music festival scene and on to college campuses nationwide.

'''Hockey pants''' are knee-to-waist protective gear for [[ice hockey]] or [[roller hockey]] players. The pants carry a variety of [[padding]] depending on whether they are worn by [[goaltender]]s or skaters ([[forward (hockey)|forwards]] and
[[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenders]]), and also on the manufacturer.

The pants are traditionally a one-piece garment with a [[lace]]-up fly augmented by a strap [[belt (clothing)|belt]]. Sometimes, they are additionally held up by [[suspenders]] (particularly in the case of goalie pants).

Hockey pants are also called "breezers" in [[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.lifetimehockey.com/resources/glossary.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626093717/http://www.lifetimehockey.com/resources/glossary.html|work=Lifetime Hockey|archivedate=26 June 2010|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Minnesota Vikings offense in a huddle.jpg|thumb|The [[Minnesota Vikings]] offense in a huddle, September 2012]]
[[File:Victory huddle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|England huddle to celebrate victory over India in Mumbai, March 2006]]

In [[sport]], a '''huddle''' is an action of a team gathering together, usually in a tight circle, to strategize, motivate or celebrate.  It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on-field communication is difficult.  Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire other team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the teams success, or to commiserate a defeat.  The term "huddle" can be used as a verb as in "huddling up."

The huddle is commonly used in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]] to strategize before each play; the offensive team's huddle is almost always led by the [[quarterback]], and the defensive huddle is typically led by one of the [[linebacker]]s.  It is also popular in [[basketball]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[volleyball]] and [[cricket]].

The huddle became more widely used in cricket after the [[India national cricket team|India national team]] used it to great success during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The [[England cricket team|England team]] has imitated this technique with some success, notably in the [[2005 Ashes series|2005]] [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series.

==Types==

===Circular===
[[File:Huddle (Baker at Ottawa) (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Baker Wildcats]] huddle up during a game]]
The modern-day circular huddle, in which the players all face inward in a tight circle, was invented by [[Gallaudet University]] quarterback [[Paul D. Hubbard]] in 1894. Gallaudet was among the first schools intended for the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and the first intended for their postsecondary education. When quarterbacking, Hubbard realized that his hand signals could be read by opposing players, a particular concern when Gallaudet played other schools for the deaf. To remedy this, he had his players form a circle so that his sign-language signals could be sent and received without anyone on the sidelines or on the opposing team seeing.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;Gannon, Jack. 1981. ''Deaf Heritage: Narrative History of Deaf America'', Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 272, 276 ([http://studentunitymovement.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_272.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of huddle is still in common use today, typically between plays in American Football as the quarterback assigns the next play to the offense.

===Typewriter===
The typewriter huddle is a huddle formation created by former [[Florida State]] Head Coach [[Tom Nugent]] in the mid-1950s. It is typically used between a coach and multiple players, or when a quarterback or other player wants to create an image of being separate from the team, dictating to them, rather than being a part of the group, as with the circular huddle. The players being spoken to are arranged in two or more rows, the front row often kneeling or crouching. The player or coach speaking can then be assured that he has the attention of the entire audience, something that often is not possible if that person is in the center of a circular huddle. Though allowing players breathing room and providing space for more participants than a circular huddle, it is not as secure, as observers on the sidelines may be able to see hand signals or read the speaker's lips.

== American football ==
In [[American football]], though seemingly random, huddles can have several forms. Before the 1890s, football players didn’t form huddles; they instead discussed the play far enough from the other team that they could not be overheard. As American football became more organized and formalized, so too did the huddle.&lt;ref name="Erick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Streelman|first1=Erick (4 August 2015)|title=No Huddle Communication|url=http://winwiththepass.com/no-huddle-communication/|website=Win With The Pass|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huddle 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers.jpg|thumb|left|400px|link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Huddle_2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers.jpg|Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL huddle.  Offensive players gather in a rough circle out of hearing of the opposing defense to plan the next play.]]

The football team at [[Oregon State Beavers|Oregon Agricultural College]] was one of the very first schools nationally to use the huddle formation in a game.  It happened against the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] during the 1918 season.  Head coach [[Homer Woodson Hargiss|Bill Hargiss]] instructed the [[Starting lineup|starters]] that once they returned to the field, they were to stand 10 yards behind the ball before the beginning of each play and whisper to one another what they were going to do next.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv11/CFHSNv11n2c.pdf#2&lt;/ref&gt;  An eyewitness to the game was veteran Seattle sports columnist [[Royal Brougham]], whose stories of the contest give testimony today to the program's early use of this pioneering new formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberheide.org/hargiss/Huddle/First%20use%20huddle.htm|title=Bill Hargiss - First Use of the Offensive huddle, 1918|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others trace the huddle to the 1890s in [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Okrent|first=Arika|title=The true origin story of the football huddle|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255892/the-true-origin-story-of-the-football-huddle|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Week]]|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of its use was when the huddle was formed by Paul Hubbard, a deaf player who went to [[Gallaudet University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] To avoid having the other team see his sign language between plays, he and his team huddled to conceal the signs.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt;

During a game, the quarterback uses the huddle to [[Play calling system|communicate the next play]] to the offense. [[National Football League]] Rule 5 Section 2 stipulates that no more than eleven players may be in the offensive huddle. An offensive substitute who communicates with a teammate in a huddle would be penalized for "unsportsmanlike conduct"; this is to prevent teams from feigning a substitution and taking advantage of the chaos to confuse opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES — Rule 5 Players, Substitutes, Equipment, General Rules|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/8_Rule5_Players_Subs_Equip_GeneralRules.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, teams may choose not to call a huddle and employ a [[Hurry-up offense|hurry-up no-huddle offense]] to maximize time and surprise the defense.

In a [[Snap (gridiron football)|snap]], the snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as "...on &lt;number&gt;." being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-quarterbacks-call-plays-and-audibilize-during-.html|title=How Quarterbacks Call Plays and Audibilize during Football Games|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==

[[File:HuddleSevilleedit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Celtic do their customary huddle before the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final, 2003]]]]

In [[Association football]] (soccer), the huddle has been used before games by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] national teams and club teams such as [[Derry City FC]]. [[Celtic FC]] from [[Scotland]] have used the huddle as a pre-match ritual since 1995, although this was pre-dated by [[St. Mirren FC]] (also from [[Scotland]]) who had been using the huddle since 1993. Celtic copied this and in turn is now carried out by all levels and ages of the Celtic club and often imitated by the supporters. The supporting visual aspect of this, although culturally unrelated can also be seen as similar to [[The Poznan]].

==Australian football==
In contrast to other sports, the huddle is a specific tactic in [[Australian rules football|Australian football]], used by the team kicking in after a [[Laws of Australian football#Scoring|behind is scored]], or some delayed stoppage. All players in the [[backline (football)|backline]] gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means that there will be several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first kick-in. It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.

The '''International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235409e.pdf |title= International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rights-based]] document which was adopted by member states of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), on November 18, 2015 during the 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference. This document is the legitimate successor of the '''International Charter of Physical Education and Sport''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13150&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Charter of Physical Education and Sport | date=21 November 1978 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO.

The original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that '''“the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all”'''.
Based on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.

== Objectives ==

In twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development.

The revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.

UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]] said: “The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/international_charter_of_physical_education_revised_to_ensure_more_inclusive_access_to_physical_activity/#.VlL51tHlvs0 |title= Press release issued by UNESCO to announce the adoption of the Sport Charter | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport contains a preamble and 12 articles. These are the main values defended by the Charter:

=== Access to sport as a fundamental right for all ===
Article 1 - The practice of physical education, physical activity and sport is a fundamental right for all

=== The values and benefits of sport ===

== Applications ==
The [[Quality Physical Education Policy Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/policy-project/ |title= Quality Physical Education Policy Project |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates how principles and recommendations stipulated in the Charter can be translated into indicators, benchmarks and tools.

== Authors of the Revision ==
The revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs. This new version was carefully examined through sessions of the '''Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS)''' and its '''Permanent Consultative Council (PCC'''), as well as UNESCO’s '''Executive Board'''. It is a follow-up to the '''Declaration of Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps-2013/declaration/|title= Declaration of Berlin| date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was adopted by 600 participants from 121 countries, as an outcome of the '''5th World Conference of Sport Ministers (MINEPS V)'''.

=== MINEPS ===
Created in 1976, the [[International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport]] (MINEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps/ |title=The International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport (MINEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a forum that facilitates intellectual and technical exchange in the field of physical education and sport. MINEPS also serves as an institutional mechanism for a coherent international strategy in this domain.
It is also the only global platform that engages governments, intergovernmental organizations, the sport movement, academia and specialized NGOs.

=== CIGEPS ===
The [[Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport]] (CIGEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/cigeps/ |title= The Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1978 to promote the role and value of sport and its inclusion in public policy. CIGEPS is composed of expert representatives in the field of physical education and sport from 18 UNESCO Member States, each elected for a four-year term. 
In 2015, CIGEPS is composed of the 18 following member states of UNESCO:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9638">A '''lacrosse stick''' or '''crosse''' is used to play the sport of [[lacrosse]].  Players use the lacrosse stick to handle the [[lacrosse ball|ball]] and to strike or "check" opposing players' sticks, causing them to drop the ball. The head of a lacrosse stick is roughly triangular in shape and is strung with loose netting that allows the ball to be caught, carried (known as "cradling"), passed, or shot.

==Traditional stick==
[[File:Wooden sticks.jpg|left|thumbnail|A pair of wood lacrosse sticks.]]
A wood lacrosse stick is usually crafted from [[hickory]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/03/11/a-lacrosse-game-with-the-1867-touches.html "A lacrosse game with the 1867 touches"]. ''Toronto Star'',  Mary Ormsby, March 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The lacrosse stick is given its shape through [[steam bending]].  Holes are drilled in the top portion of the head and the sidewall (''i.e.'', the side of the stick head), permitting weaving of  string, which is then hardened by dipping the in [[resin]].  [[Leather]] "runners" are strung from the top of the "head" to the "throat" of the stick.  Then nylon string is woven in to create the pocket.&lt;ref name="stickmaker"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stick Maker|url=http://redhawkslax.com/history/the-stick-maker/|publisher=Onondaga Redhawks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stick Diagram.png|right|thumbnail|Diagram of Mitchell Brothers wooden lacrosse goalie stick.]]
The wooden lacrosse stick dates back to the creation of the sport and is still made by craftsmen around the world. Though modern lacrosse sticks made of plastic have become the overwhelming choice for contemporary lacrosse players, traditional wooden lacrosse sticks are still commonly used by [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|box lacrosse goaltenders]], senior and masters players, and by women's [[field lacrosse]] players. Wooden sticks are still legal under [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]] and NCAA rules but are subject to the same size regulations as modern lacrosse sticks. The only exception to this is the [[Western Lacrosse Association]], which prohibited the use of wooden sticks by non-goaltenders some years ago. The last WLA player to use one was A.J. Smith of the [[Coquitlam Adanacs]], c. 2003–04, who had been [[grandfathered]].

==Men's modern stick==
===Head===
[[Image:lacrosse head diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of a Men's Lacrosse Stick Head]]
In 1970, the first patent (US Patent #3,507,495) for a synthetic lacrosse stick was issued to [[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= US Pat #3,507,495 'Lacrosse Stick' Tucker et al|url=http://www.prior-ip.com/patent/2614716/lacrosse-stick?q=BURNETT%20&amp;%20CO%20WM%20T}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern lacrosse stick consists of a plastic molded head attached to a metal shaft. The head is strung with nylon or leather strings to form a pocket. The dimensions of the stick (length, width, sidewall height, and depth of the pocket) are governed by league rules, such as [[NCAA]] rules for collegiate players or [[Federation of International Lacrosse|FIL]] rules for international players.

[[File:Lacrosse stick 8028.jpg|thumb|Field goalie's stick.]]
In men's lacrosse, the head of the stick must be {{convert|6|to|10|in|cm}} wide at its widest point under [[NCAA]] rules. Most stick are the minimum 6 inches wide. The head of the [[Goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]'s stick is much larger and must be between 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches wide under NCAA rules or up to 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide under FIL rules.&lt;ref name="ncaa17rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Men's Lacrosse 2017 and 2018 Rules|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC18.pdf|publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=14}}&lt;ref name="fil17rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017-2018 Rules of Men’s Field Lacrosse|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/men/Rules/FIL_MF_Rulebook_2017-2018-A4v1-1.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=7}} The sidewalls of the head may not be more than two inches tall.

===Pocket===
The pocket of the head is where the ball is carried and caught. It consists of interwoven string attached to the head. Traditional stringing with leather strings interwoven with nylon has declined in popularity in favor of synthetic mesh stringing. Mesh is typically made of nylon and comes in a variety of diamond configurations, which can affect the pocket's throwing and retention characteristics. 

The typical mesh pocket uses four main nylon strings to affix the mesh piece to the head: a topstring, two sidewalls, and a bottom string. The topstring is often made of a slightly thicker string, in order to resist the abrasive forces that come from scooping the ball up. The sidewalls are used to affix individual mesh diamonds to the sidewall holes on the sidewall of the head. The sidewalls have the most effect on the pocket's performance, as they dictate the placement of the pocket in the head, the tightness of the channel of the pocket, and even the pocket depth. The bottom string is used to fine-tune the pocket depth, and serves to keep the ball from slipping through the bottom of the pocket.

[[File:Lacrosse head.jpg|thumb|right|A legal men's pocket where the top of the ball is above the bottom of the stick's sidewall.]]

In addition to the four strings used to affix the mesh piece, shooting strings are woven through the diamonds of the mesh in order to help fine-tune the pocket's characteristics.  They can either be made of typical nylon string, or a hockey style lace. Shooting strings are often used in straight, U, or V shapes.  They serve to increase the pocket's hold on the ball, as well as fine-tune the way the stick throws. They can act to change the tension of various portions of the pocket, helping to create a "ramp" for the ball to roll along as it exits the pocket.

As of the 2013 season, the NCAA has passed a rule stating that shooting strings are limited to an area within a 4-inch arc drawn from the top of the plastic of the scoop.This essentially eliminates U- or V-shaped shooting strings, as they almost always cross below the 4-inch line. The pocket depth is governed by rule as well. When the ball is placed in the deepest point, the top of the ball must not be below the bottom of the sidewall.&lt;ref name=ncaa17rules /&gt;{{rp|page=15}}

===Shaft===
Modern handles, more commonly referred to as "shafts," are made of hollow metal. They are usually octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are still made from other materials, including wood, plastic, or [[fiberglass]]. The open end of the hollow shaft must be covered with tape or a plug (commonly referred to as the "butt" or "butt end" of the stick), usually made of rubber.  The head of the stick is usually attached to the shaft with a screw to keep it in place.

Stick length is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks (including the head) be from 40 to 42&amp;nbsp;inches long for offensive players, 52 to 72&amp;nbsp;inches long for defensemen, and 40 to 72&amp;nbsp;inches long for goalies.&lt;ref name=equipment&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment |title=Player Equipment |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the minimum length (40&amp;nbsp;inches) in order to give them the advantage of having a shorter stick to protect from defensive checks.  Conversely, defensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the maximum length (72&amp;nbsp;inches) to permit them the greatest range in covering their offensive player.

In 2016, a rules clarification was made by the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Rules Committee. Questions have arisen regarding the alteration of the shaft circumference. The circumference of the shaft cannot exceed 3 1/2". To be clear, added tape to the shaft must not make the shaft exceed this circumference measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/2016DIMLA_MEMO_2.2.16_Interpretations_and_Clarifications_020516.pdf|title = 2016 Rules Updates and Clarifications|date = February 4, 2016|access-date = |website = NCAA|publisher = NCAA|last = Scalise|first = Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:warrior diamonds.jpg|center|frame|Three offensive-player length shafts for men's lacrosse]]

==Women's modern stick==
In women's lacrosse, the stick dimensions are similar except the pocket depth is much shallower. NCAA rules dictate that the head of a woman's stick may be from seven to nine inches wide, and must be strung traditionally, with a pocket formed by a grid of leather strings.  Nylon mesh stringing, permitted in men's sticks, is not permitted in women's sticks; however, the goalkeeper's stick head may be up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches wide and is allowed to be strung with nylon mesh. The legal depth of a women's stick pocket is determined by the following test: the top of the lacrosse ball, when placed in the pocket, must remain above the top edge of the sidewall. Women's sticks can be 35.5 to 43.25&amp;nbsp;inches long.&lt;ref name=womenequipment&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women |title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All professional sports leagues for which a country has at least one team that competes in it will be listed under that country. As such, many sports leagues will be listed under multiple countries. Leagues listed under 'World' or 'Europe' generally feature competitors that come from various countries, with each season possibly featuring different competitors and different countries, which makes them harder to define in terms of which countries they should be listed under.

In organized [[sport]]s, '''match fixing''' occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to obtain a payoff from gamblers, but teams may also intentionally perform poorly to gain a future advantage, such as a better [[draft pick]]{{efn-ua|{{clear}}

Match fixing, when motivated by gambling, requires contacts (and normally money transfers) between gamblers, players, team officials, and/or referees. These contacts and transfers can sometimes be found, and lead to prosecution by the law or the sports league(s). In contrast, losing for future advantage is internal to the team and very hard to prove. Often, substitutions made by the coach designed to deliberately increase the team's chances of losing (such as having key players sit out, using minimal or phantom injuries as an excuse), rather than ordering the players actually on the field to intentionally underperform, are cited as the main factor in cases where this has been alleged.

Match fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another form of match fixing, known as [[spot fixing]], involves fixing small events within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the final result of the game.

Other names for match fixing include '''game fixing''', '''race fixing''', '''sports fixing''', or '''hippodroming'''.  Games that are deliberately lost are sometimes called '''thrown games'''.  When a team intentionally loses a game, or does not score as high as it can, to obtain a perceived future competitive advantage, the team is often said to have '''tanked''' the game instead of having thrown it. In [[hustling|pool hustling]], tanking is known as '''dumping'''. In sports where a handicap system exists and is capable of being abused, tanking is known as [[Glossary of cue sports terms#sandbag|sandbag]]ging.

==Motivations and causes==
The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and future team advantage.

===Agreements with gamblers===
{{Main article|Match fixing related to gambling}}

There may be financial gain through agreements with [[gambling|gamblers]]. The most infamous example of this in North America was the [[Black Sox Scandal]] of 1919, in which several members of the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] conspired with gamblers to fix the [[1919 World Series|World Series]].

One of the best-known examples of gambling-related race fixing (in motorsports) is the 1933 [[Tripoli Grand Prix]], in which the winning number of the lottery was determined by the number of the race-winning car. One ticket holder held the number belonging to [[Achille Varzi]], contacted him and agreed to share the winning should he win. Varzi contacted other drivers who agreed to share the money if they deliberately lost. Despite a poor start, Varzi won the race after his opponents deliberately underperformed throughout the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The race that was rigged? |author=Martin Williamson |year=2010 |url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/21012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sportradar]], a company that monitors the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many as 1% of the matches they monitor are likely to be fixed.&lt;ref name='fixersbeware' /&gt;

====Protection against manipulation====
By monitoring the pre-match betting markets it is possible to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation.&lt;ref name='fixersbeware'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixers beware|url=https://www.gamblinginsider.com/in-depth/1667/fixers-beware|website=Gambling Insider|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2016 MLB season, Major League Baseball (MLB) hired Genius Sports, a sports technology company specialising in integrity, to monitor the betting patterns on all of their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/mlb-is-keeping-a-very-close-eye-on-gambling-to-protect-the-sports-integrity/2016/05/30/0581b24a-1ed5-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=30 May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several federations run integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Fantasy Sports Spell The End Of Corruption In Athletics?|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/do-fantasy-sports-spell-the-end-of-corruption-in-athletics/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better playoff chances===
Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their opponent in the next round. As a result, by losing a match, a team can face an easier opponent in the next round, making them more likely to win. Although aligned with tanking, this action is generally viewed as acceptable in American sports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the [[National Basketball Association]], there have also been allegations{{By whom|date=August 2012}} of teams tanking games to finish in sixth rather than fifth place in the conference standings, thus enabling the team in question to evade a possible playoff match with the conference's top seed until the final round of playoffs in that conference (for more details see [[single-elimination tournament]]).  Additionally, the NBA is the only one of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] of the [[United States]] in which home advantage in the playoffs is based strictly on regular-season record without regard to seeding. This led to (unproven) allegations of late-season tanking by the [[2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers season|2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers]] in order to finish sixth instead of fifth in their conference; because of the league's playoff hosting rules, the Clippers would have home advantage in the 3–6 matchup but not the 4–5 matchup.  Following that season, the NBA changed its playoff format so that the best second-place team in each conference would be able to obtain up to the #2 seed should it have the second-best conference record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/article.jsp?content=20060802_150747_2508]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729073129/http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/article.jsp?content=20060802_150747_2508 |date=July 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA has since changed its playoff format again, now awarding playoff berths to the top eight teams in each conference without regard to divisional alignment.

On occasion, a [[National Football League]] team has also been accused of throwing its final regular-season game in an attempt to "choose" its possible opponent in the subsequent playoffs.

Perhaps the most notable example of this was when the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who had clinched a playoff berth, lost their regular-season finale in [[1988 NFL season|1988]] to the [[Los Angeles Rams]], thereby knocking the [[New York Giants]] (who had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, also injuring 49er quarterback [[Joe Montana]] in the latter year's game) out of the postseason on tiebreakers; after the game, Giants quarterback [[Phil Simms]] angrily accused the 49ers of "laying down like dogs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-12-31/sports/17459066_1_49ers-jeff-fisher-rest-players |last=Miller | first=Ira | date=March 31, 2004 | title=Can't blame 'em for not trying | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Canadian Football League]], since the introduction of the ''cross-over rule'' [[CFL West Division|Western]] teams have been occasionally accused of tanking near the end of the season in situations where a loss would cause them to finish fourth place in their division and where such a finish was still good enough to secure a berth in the league's [[CFL East Division|East Division]] playoffs. In recent years, the East has often been viewed to be a weaker division than the West; however, if any Western team has actually attempted such a strategy up to and included the [[2014 CFL season|2014 season]], it has not paid significant dividends for them since Western cross-over teams have only won one Eastern playoff game and have never advanced to the [[Grey Cup]] championship game from the Eastern bracket.

A more recent example of possible tanking occurred in the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|ice hockey competition]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. In Pool B, [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] was to face [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovakia]] in the last pool match for both teams. Sweden coach [[Bengt-Åke Gustafsson]] publicly contemplated tanking against Slovakia, knowing that if his team won, their quarterfinal opponent would either be [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] gold medalists, or the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] gold medalists. Gustafsson would tell Swedish television "One is [[cholera]], the other [[bubonic plague|the plague]]." Sweden lost the match 3–0; the most obvious sign of tanking was when Sweden had a five-on-three [[power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] with five [[National Hockey League|NHL]] stars—[[Peter Forsberg]], [[Mats Sundin]], [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Nicklas Lidström]], and [[Fredrik Modin]]—on the ice, and failed to put a shot on goal. (''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, "If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the [[Washington Generals]].") If he was seeking to tank, Gustafsson got his wish; Sweden would face a much less formidable quarterfinal opponent in [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]]. Canada would lose to [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]] in a quarterfinal in the opposite bracket, while Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating the Czechs in the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2006/03/06/8371329/swede-success |last=Farber | first=Michael | date=March 6, 2006 | title=Swede Success | work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1998 Tiger Cup]] – an [[international]] [[association football|football]] tournament contested by countries in [[Southeast Asia]] – saw an example of two teams trying to lose a match. The tournament was hosted by [[Vietnam]] and the eight countries competing were split into two groups of four. The top two in each group advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing the runners-up of the other group. In the first group [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] won the group with [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] finishing second. This meant that the winners of the second group would have to travel to [[Hanoi]] to play the host nation in the national stadium on their national day whilst the runners-up would face Singapore in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] where the final group match was taking place. As the two teams involved - [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] - had both already qualified for the semi-finals it was in their interest to lose the match and finish in second place. As the game progressed neither side seemed particularly concerned with scoring whilst the defending was lackadaisical. As the match entered stoppage time the Indonesian defender [[Mursyid Effendi]] scored an [[own goal]] (overcoming the efforts of the opposition players to stop him). Both teams were fined $40,000 and Effendi was banned from international football for life.

The [[2012 Summer Olympics]] saw at least two examples of actual or potential tanking of this type:
* In the most famous example, members of the [[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Chinese]], [[Indonesia at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Indonesian]] and [[South Korea at the 2012 Summer Olympics|South Korean]] [[badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics|badminton]] teams were disqualified for intentionally losing matches to allow better pairings in the knockout stages of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/top-doubles-pairs-in-badminton-booed-appearing-to-play-to-lose-group-match-at-wembley-arena/2012/07/31/gJQARsdiNX_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807032948/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/top-doubles-pairs-in-badminton-booed-appearing-to-play-to-lose-group-match-at-wembley-arena/2012/07/31/gJQARsdiNX_story.html |archive-date=7 August 2012 |title=Indonesian official: 8 badminton players disqualified from Olympic doubles for trying to lose |publisher=Washington Post |date=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677 |title=Olympics badminton: Eight women disqualified from doubles | publisher=BBC | date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what the BBC called a “night of shame,” players made simple errors throughout the match, despite boos from the crowd and warnings from the match referee to cease and desist. The [[Badminton World Federation]] had charged the four pairs with “not using one’s best efforts to win a match” and “conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/01/expelled-olympic-badminton-players-cant-even-get-cheating-right/ | title=Expelled Olympic badminton players win gold for lack of subtlety | date=1 August 2012 | publisher=''National Post'' | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120802002902/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/01/expelled-olympic-badminton-players-cant-even-get-cheating-right/ | archivedate=2 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's football tournament]], [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] intentionally played to a draw with [[South Africa women's national football team|South Africa]] in [[Millennium Stadium|Cardiff]] so that it could finish second in its group and not have to travel to [[Hampden Park|Glasgow]], more than 300 miles away, for the first round of the knockout stage.  Instead, Japan remained in Cardiff and defeated [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] in the ensuing quarterfinal match en route to the gold medal match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/martin-rogers-japans-womens-soccer-023300712--sow.html |title=Martin Rogers: Japan's women's soccer team plays to intentional draw | date=1 August 2012 | publisher=Yahoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, two girls' basketball teams representing [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-area [[Riverdale High School (Murfreesboro, Tennessee)|Riverdale]] and [[Smyrna High School (Tennessee)|Smyrna High Schools]] were found to be tanking a consolation match of their district tournament.&lt;ref name=Kreager&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnj.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/02/23/riverdale-smyrna-removed-postseason/23888217/ |title=Riverdale, Smyrna girls basketball teams removed from postseason |first=Tom |last=Kreager |newspaper=[[The Daily News Journal]] |location=[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] |date=February 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the game would enter the same side of the regional tournament bracket as defending state champion&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt; [[Blackman High School]] (ranked as one of the country's top 10 teams by some national publications), setting up a potential match in the regional semifinals.&lt;ref name=Bonesteel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/02/24/heres-why-two-tennessee-girls-basketball-teams-both-tried-to-lose/ |title=Here’s why two Tennessee girls’ basketball teams both tried to lose |first=Matt |last=Bonesteel |work=Early Lead |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loser would avoid Blackman until the regional final, a game whose participants would both advance to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state tournament).&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt; During this game:
* Both coaches pulled their starters early.&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt;
* Riverdale intentionally missed more than a dozen free throws.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;
* Smyrna deliberately committed several failure to cross the midcourt line and over-and-back violations.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;
* Players from both teams deliberately tried to be called for 3-second violations. At one point, a player gave the official a 3-second signal in an attempt to get called.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt;
* The final straw for the officials was when a Smyrna player attempted an [[own goal]] that did not count because the team had already been called for failure to cross the midcourt line in time. The officials then called both coaches aside, accusing them of making a mockery of the game.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;

The [[Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association]], which governs high school sports in the state, took a very dim view of this escapade, banning both teams from further postseason play, fining the two schools a total of $1,500, and placing both teams on probation through the 2015–16 school year.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;

On the other hand, the practice of coaches on a playoff-bound team deliberately benching a team's best players for some or all of the final match(es) of the regular season is often defended as a common sense measure to avoid unnecessarily risking injuries and fatigue to the team's star players. Some argue that a coach not only should have the right but ought to select a starting lineup for a match that gives the team the best chance of winning titles in the long run, should this be a different lineup compared to the one that gives his team the best chance of winning the upcoming game. Of course, when coaches elect to do this, they are not necessarily deliberately trying to lose. For example, during Euro 2004 the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] rested nearly all of its starters from the first two group matches for the final group match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Since the Czechs had already clinched first place in the group, this move was seen to have the potential to allow Germany a better chance get the win they needed to advance at the expense of the winner of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]-[[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] game. As it happened, the Czechs' decision to field a "weaker" side did not matter since the Czechs won the match anyway to eliminate the Germans.

===Better draft position===
{{rquote|right|Sometimes my job is to understand the value of losing. I know that sounds crazy, but if you're an NBA general manager like me, the last place you want to be is in the middle. There are only two outcomes there: Either make the playoffs and be first-round fodder for one of the premier teams or miss the playoffs and pick somewhere around 11th to 14th in the draft. Either way, the odds are that you stay in that middle range. It's a recipe for disaster.|Anonymous, 2013{{r|goodman20131029}}}}

Most top-level sports leagues in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North America]] and [[Sport in Australia|Australia]] hold [[Draft (sports)|drafts]] to allocate young players to the league's teams. The order in which teams select players is often the inverse of their standings in the previous season. As a result, a team may have a significant incentive to tank games to secure a higher pick in the league's next draft, and a number of leagues have changed their draft rules to remove (or at least limit) potential incentives to tank.

From [[1966 NBA draft|1966]] to [[1984 NBA draft|1984]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] used a coin flip between the teams with the worst records in each of the league's two conferences to determine the recipient of the top pick. In the {{nbay|1983|app=season}}, several teams were accused of deliberately losing games in an attempt to gain a top position in the [[1984 NBA draft|1984 draft]], which would eventually produce four [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame players]]. As a result of this, the NBA established a [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] in advance of the [[1985 NBA draft|1985 draft]], involving all teams that did not make the playoffs in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2005/05/22/2005-05-22_the_draft_that_changed_it_al.html |title=The Draft That Changed It All.

Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the current lottery gives the team with the worst record only a 25% chance at the top pick (with that team guaranteed no worse than the fourth pick), there can still be some incentive for a team to tank.  In an interview for ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' before the {{nbay|2013|app=season}}, an NBA general manager who chose to remain anonymous (though speculated to be either [[Rob Hennigan]] of the [[Orlando Magic]] or [[Ryan McDonough (NBA executive)|Ryan McDonough]] of the [[Phoenix Suns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/one-nba-general-manager-admits-tanking-2013-14-192122473--nba.html |title=One NBA general manager admits to tanking the 2013-14 season … anonymously |first=Kelly |last=Dwyer |work=Ball Don't Lie |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The GM explained how he got the team's owners and the coach to agree to it while trying to keep it a secret from the players.&lt;ref name=goodman20131029&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9893551/anonymous-nba-gm-why-team-tank-season-espn-magazine |title=The art of the tank |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |publisher=''ESPN The Magazine'' |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |quote=Our team isn't good enough to win and we know it.

Sometimes my job is to understand the value of losing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to these perceived incentives, the NBA further tweaked its lottery rules shortly before the start of the 2017–18 season. Effective with the 2019 draft, the teams with the three worst records will have equal odds of landing the #1 pick (barring one of said teams also owning another lottery team's pick), and the top four picks will be allocated in the lottery instead of the top three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helin|first1=Kurt|title=NBA owners pass lottery reform, new rules on resting players|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/09/28/nba-owners-pass-lottery-reform-new-rules-on-resting-players/|website=ProBasketballTalk|accessdate=September 29, 2017|date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Football League]], the main competition of [[Australian rules football]], has used a system of [[priority draft pick]]s since [[1993 AFL Draft|1993]], with poorly performing teams receiving extra selections at or near the start of the draft. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria. However, that system led to accusations of tanking by several clubs—most notably by [[Melbourne Football Club tanking scandal|Melbourne in 2009]] (the club was found not guilty, but the head coach and general manager were found guilty on related charges). Since 2012, priority picks are awarded at the discretion of the [[AFL Commission]], the governing body of both the AFL and the overall sport.

Until the [[2014–15 NHL season]], the [[National Hockey League]] assured the last place team of at least the second position in its entry draft, with the first overall pick being subject to a draft lottery among the five worst teams. As NHL drafts typically include only one NHL-ready prospect, if any at all, in any given year (most others must continue developing in [[junior ice hockey]] or the [[minor league]]s for several years before reaching the NHL), this rudimentary lottery has historically been enough of a deterrent to avoid deliberate tanking. However, in 2014–15, two elite prospects widely considered to be “generational talents,” [[Connor McDavid]] and [[Jack Eichel]], were projected to enter the [[2015 NHL Entry Draft]], thus ensuring the last place team at least one of the two prospects. This was most prominent with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], whose fans openly rooted against their team in the hopes they would clinch last place in the league for much of the season (the Sabres themselves denied they were tanking and openly criticized their fans for suggesting the notion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=759960|title=Sabres unhappy after fans cheer Gagner's winning goal in OT that gives Coyotes 4-3 win|work=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2015–16, the top three picks in the draft will be subject to lottery, with all fourteen teams that did not qualify for the playoffs eligible to win the picks.

===More favorable schedule next year===

NFL teams have been accused of tanking games to obtain a more favorable schedule the following season; this was especially true between 1977 and 1993, when a team finishing last in a five-team division would get to play four of its eight non-division matches the next season against other last-place teams.

===Match fixing by referees===
In addition to the match fixing that is committed by players, coaches and/or team officials, it is not unheard of to have results manipulated by corrupt [[referee]]s.  Since 2004, separate [[scandal]]s have erupted in prominent sports leagues in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=519776&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title=Porto chief up on referee bribery charges |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany ([[Bundesliga scandal (2005)|Bundesliga scandal]]), Brazil ([[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]]) and the United States (see [[2007 NBA betting scandal|Tim Donaghy scandal]]), all of which concerned referees who fixed matches for gamblers.  Many sports writers have speculated that in leagues with high player salaries, it is far more likely for a referee to become corrupt since their pay in such competitions is usually much less than that of the players.

On December 2, 1896, former [[American frontier|Old West]] lawman [[Wyatt Earp]] refereed the [[Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey]] boxing match, promoted as the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Championship of the World]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Arne K.|title=Prizefighting: An American History|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786436545|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ9CMH01BccC&amp;pg=PA237|accessdate=October 30, 2014|pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earp was chosen as referee by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; Fitzsimmons went to court to attempt to stop Shakey from taking the purse, but failed when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=rego2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rego|first1=Nilda|title=Days Gone By: Earp's controversial call gets upheld in court|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_14202746|website=Inside Bay Area|accessdate=October 24, 2014 |date=January 24, 2010|quote=Part 2 of 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was arrested in Portland, Oregon. He had been accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee said, "I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair."&lt;ref name=sfcal1905&gt;{{cite news|title=Asserts He Fixed the Sharkey "Foul"|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1905-08-14/ed-1/seq-11/|accessdate=October 31, 2014|publisher=The San Francisco Call|date=August 14, 1905|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match fixing to a draw or a fixed score===
Match fixing does not necessarily involve deliberately losing a match. Occasionally, teams have been accused of deliberately playing to a draw or a fixed score where this ensures some mutual benefit (e.g. both teams advancing to the next stage of a competition.)  One of the earliest examples of this sort of match fixing in the modern era occurred in [[1897–98 Football League#Test matches 1898|1898]] when [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] intentionally drew in that year's final "test match" so as to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season.  In response, [[English Football League|the Football League]] expanded the divisions to 18 teams that year, thus permitting the intended victims of the fix ([[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]) to remain in the First Division.  The "test match" system was abandoned and replaced with automatic [[relegation]].

A more recent example occurred in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] played [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in [[Disgrace of Gijón|the last match of group B]]. A West German victory by 1 or 2 goals would result in both teams advancing; any less and Germany was out; any more and Austria was out (and replaced by [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], who had just beaten Chile).  West Germany attacked hard and scored after 10 minutes. Afterwards, the players then proceeded to just kick the ball around aimlessly for the remainder of the match. Algerian supporters were so angered that they waved banknotes at the players, while a German fan burned his German flag in disgust.&lt;ref name="Dodgiest game"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Lawrence |last1=Booth |first2=Rob |last2=Smyth |title=What's the dodgiest game in football history? |publisher=The Guardian |location=Manchester |date=2004-08-11 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/aug/11/theknowledge.sport |accessdate=2012-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the second half, the ARD commentator [[:de:Eberhard Stanjek|Eberhard Stanjek]] refused any further comment on the game, while the Austrian television commentator [[:de:Robert Seeger|Robert Seeger]] advised viewers to switch off their sets. As a result, [[FIFA]] changed its tournament scheduling for subsequent [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] so that the final pair of matches in each group are played simultaneously.

Another example took place on the next-to-last weekend of the [[1992–93 Serie A]] season. [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] entered their match with [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] needing only a point to secure the title ahead of crosstown rivals [[Inter Milan|Inter]], while Brescia believed a point would be enough for them to avoid relegation. In a 2004 retrospective on the "dodgiest games" in football history, two British journalists said about the match, "For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers." Milan scored in the 82nd minute, but Brescia "mysteriously found themselves with a huge overlap" and equalised two minutes later. The 1–1 draw gave Milan their title, but in the end did not help Brescia; other results went against them and they suffered the drop.&lt;ref name="Dodgiest game"/&gt;

In knockout competitions where the rules require drawn matches to be [[replay (sports)|replayed]], teams have sometimes been accused of intentionally playing one or more draws so as to ensure (a) replay(s). In this case, the motive is usually financial since the ensuing replay(s) would typically be expected to generate additional revenue for the participating teams. One notorious example of this particular type of alleged fix was the [[1909 Scottish Cup Final]], which sparked a riot after being played twice to a draw.

===Increased gate receipts===
In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged fixing of drawn matches to ensure replays, mutual fixes have sometimes been alleged in "best of X" knockout series where draws are either not possible or very uncommon. Early versions of baseball's [[World Series]] were a common target of such allegations. Because the players received a percentage of the gate receipts for postseason games (a privilege they did not enjoy in the regular season), there was a perception that the players had an incentive to fix an equal number of early games in favor of each team so as to ensure the series would run the maximum number of games (or very close thereto). 

Partly as an effort to avoid this sort of controversy, early World Series sometimes saw all scheduled games played even if the Series winner was already determined. That did not prove satisfactory since few fans were willing to pay to watch [[wikt:lame duck|lame duck]] contests. Eventually, following the controversy at the 
conclusion of the 1904 season in which the [[New York Giants]] boycotted the World Series in part because of dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements surrounding the Series, Major League Baseball agreed to a number of reforms proposed by Giants owner [[John T. Brush]]. Among other things, the so-called "Brush Rules" stipulated that the players would only receive a share of ticket revenue from the first four games, thus eliminating any financial incentive for the players to deliberately prolong the World Series.

===Abuse of tie-breaking rules===
On several occasions, "creative" use of tie-breaking rules have allegedly led teams to play less than their best.

An example occurred in the [[2004 European Football Championship]]. Unlike [[FIFA]], [[UEFA]] takes the result of the game between the two tied teams (or in a three-way tie, the overall records of the games played with the teams in question only) into consideration before overall [[goal difference]] when ranking teams level on points, a situation arose in Group C where [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] played to a 2–2 draw, which was a sufficiently high scoreline to eliminate [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (which had lower-scoring draws with the Swedes and Danes) regardless of Italy's result with already-eliminated [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].  Although Italy beat Bulgaria by only one goal to finish level with Sweden and Denmark on five points, and would hypothetically have been eliminated using the FIFA tie-breaker too, some Italian fans bitterly contended that the FIFA tie-breaker would have motivated their team to play harder and deterred their [[Scandinavia]]n rivals from, in their view, at the very least half-heartedly playing out the match after the score became 2–2.  The same situation happened to Italy in 2012, leading to many pre-game complaints from Italy, who many commentators suggested were right to be concerned because of their own extensive experience in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/italy-is-shocked-shocked-by-talk-of-a-fix/ |title=Italy Is Shocked — Shocked! — by Talk of a Fix |publisher=New York Times |date=18 June 2012 |author=Andrew Das }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Spain-Croatia ended up 1–0, and the Italians went through.

The FIFA tie-breaker, or any goal-differential scheme, can cause problems, too.  There have been incidents (especially in [[basketball]]) where players on a favored team have won the game but deliberately ensured the quoted [[point spread]] was not covered (see [[point shaving]]).  Conversely, there are cases where a team not only lost (which might be honest) but lost by some large amount, perhaps to ensure a point spread was covered, or to grant some non-gambling related favor to the victor. Perhaps the most famous alleged example was the match between Argentina and Peru in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Argentina needed a four-goal victory to advance over Brazil, an enormous margin at this level of competition, especially since Argentina had a weak offense (6 goals in 5 games) and Peru a stout defence (6 goals allowed in 5 games). Yet somehow, Argentina won 6–0. Much was made over political collusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We fixed it! Peru senator claims 1978 World Cup game against Argentina was rigged |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2098970/Argentina-cheated-World-Cup-1978-says-Peru-senator.html |date=9 Feb 2012 |publisher=Daily Mail |author=Matt Roper |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Peruvian goalkeeper was born in Argentina, and that Peru was dependent on Argentinian grain shipments, but nothing was ever proven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bungs-and-bribes-football-cant-kick-this-habit-1611274.html Bungs and bribes football can't kick this habit] (retrieved 12 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Denmark–Sweden game above led to calls for UEFA to adopt FIFA's tiebreaking formula for future tournaments, it is not clear if this solves the problem; the Argentina-Peru game shows a possible abuse of the FIFA tie-breaker. Proponents of the UEFA tie-breaker argue that it reduces the value of ''blow-outs'', whether these be the result of a much stronger team ''running up the score'' or an already-eliminated side allowing an unusually large number of goals. Perhaps the most infamous incident occurred in December 1983 when [[Spain national football team|Spain]], needing to win by eleven goals to qualify for the [[1984 European Football Championship|Euro 1984]] ahead of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], defeated [[Malta national football team|Malta]] by a score of 12–1 on the strength of ''nine'' second half goals. Especially in [[association football|international football]], such lopsided results are seen as unsavoury, even if they are honest. If anything, these incidents serves as evidence that the FIFA tie-breaker can cause incentives to perpetrate a fix in some circumstances, the UEFA tie-breaker in others.

Tie-breaking rules played the central role in one of [[cricket]]'s more notorious matches. In a [[1979 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup|1979]] [[Worcestershire v Somerset, 1979|match]] in England's now-defunct [[Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]], a [[Limited overs cricket|one-day]] league, [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] hosted [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the final group match for both sides. Going into that match, Somerset led their group with three wins from three matches, but would end in a three-way tie for the top spot if they lost to Worcestershire and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] defeated the then-winless [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor Counties South]]. In that event, the tie-breaker would be bowling [[strike rate]]. The Somerset players calculated that a large enough loss could see them miss the quarter-finals. Accordingly, Somerset captain [[Brian Rose (cricketer)|Brian Rose]] determined that if Somerset batted first and declared their innings closed after one over, they would protect their strike rate advantage, assuring advancement to the quarter-finals. When Somerset won the toss, Rose implemented the plan, batting in the first partnership and declaring at the close of the first over after Somerset scored only one run on a no-ball.  Worcestershire won during their second over. Rose's strategy, although not against the letter of the rules, was condemned by media and cricket officials, and the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (predecessor to the current [[England and Wales Cricket Board]]) voted to expel Somerset from that season's competition.

===Prize sharing===
A player can concede with the understanding that the opponent will share the prize equally with him or her. Depending on the game, this can lead to disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://blogs.magicjudges.org/whatsupdocs/2013/11/01/unsporting-conduct-improperly-determining-a-winner-and-bribery/|title=Unsporting Conduct — Improperly Determining a Winner and Bribery|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest action===
On occasion, teams tank games as a protest against actions in earlier games. The most lopsided professional football match in history, [[AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne]], was a result of SO l'Emyrne intentionally losing the game in protest against the referee's action in a previous game.

===Individual performance in team sports===
Bookmakers in the early 21st century accept bets on a far wider range of sports-related propositions than ever before. Thus, a gambling-motivated fix might not necessarily involve any direct attempt to influence the outright result, especially in team sports where such a fix would require the co-operation (and prerequsitely, the knowledge) of many people, and/or perhaps would be more likely to arouse suspicion. Fixing the result of a more particular proposition might be seen as less likely to be noticed. For example, disgraced former [[National Basketball Association]] referee [[Tim Donaghy]] has been alleged to have perpetrated some of his fixes by calling games in such a manner as to ensure more points than expected were scored by both teams, thus affecting "[[over-under]]" bets on the games whilst also ensuring that Donaghy at least did not look to be outright [[bias]]ed. Also, bets are increasingly being taken on individual performances in team sporting events, which in turn has seen the rise of a phenomenon known as [[spot fixing]], although it is currently unlikely that enough is bet on an average player to allow someone to place a substantial wager on them without being noticed.

One such attempt was described by retired footballer [[Matthew Le Tissier]], who in 2009 admitted that while he was playing with [[Southampton FC]] back in 1995 he tried (and failed) to kick the ball out of play right after the kick-off of a [[Premier League]] match against [[Wimbledon FC]] so that a group of associates would collect on a wager made on an early throw-in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gXi4gCHhureGn65aDhekC5DP2uhw]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917183730/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gXi4gCHhureGn65aDhekC5DP2uhw |date=September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|in 2010]], Pakistani cricket players were accused of committing specific [[no-ball]] penalties for the benefit of gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan embroiled in no-ball betting scandal against England |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/29/pakistan-cricket-betting-allegations |date=29 August 2010 |publisher=The Observer, UK |location=London |first=Vic |last=Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scandal centred on three Pakistani players accepting bribes from a bookmaker, [[Mazhar Majeed]] during the Lord's test match against England. Following investigations by the News of the World and Scotland Yard, on 1 November 2011, Majeed, Pakistan's captain, [[Salman Butt]], [[Mohammad Asif]] and [[Mohammad Amir]] were found guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments.

As a result, all three of the players were banned by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC); Butt for ten years, Asif for seven and Amir for five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2016/07/12/pakistan-spot-fixing-shame-the-inside-story-on-the-day-the-home/|title=Pakistan spot-fixing shame: The inside story on the day the home of cricket became engulfed in scandal|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months for Majeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15573463|title=Salman Butt and Pakistan bowlers jailed for no-ball plot|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of non-gambling-motivated fixing on wagering===

Whenever any serious motivation for teams to manipulate results becomes apparent to the general public, there can be a corresponding effect on betting markets as honest gamblers speculate in [[good faith]] as to the chance such a fix might be attempted.  Some bettors might choose to avoid wagering on such a fixture while others will be motivated to wager on it, or alter the bet they would otherwise place.  Such actions will invariably affect [[odds]] and [[point spread]]s even if there is no contact whatsoever between teams and the relevant gambling interests.  The rise of [[betting exchange]]s has allowed such speculation to play out in real time.

==History==

Since gambling pre-dates recorded history it comes as little surprise that evidence of match fixing is found throughout recorded history. The [[ancient Olympic Games]] were almost constantly dealing with allegations of [[sportsperson|athlete]]s accepting [[bribery|bribes]] to lose a competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/the-fix-was-in-for-ancient-wrestling-match-140417.htm |title=The Fix Was in for Ancient Wrestling Match
|date=Apr 17, 2014 |author=Owen Jarus |publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[city-states]] which often tried to manipulate the outcome with large amounts of money. These activities went on despite the [[oath]] each athlete took to protect the integrity of the events and the severe punishment sometimes inflicted on those who were caught. [[Chariot racing]] was also dogged by race fixing throughout its history.

By the end of the 19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not stop its widespread practice. [[Boxing]] soon became rife with fighters "taking a dive", likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. [[Baseball]] also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the [[National League]] to stop gambling at its games.  Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when eight members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] threw the [[World Series]] (see [[Black Sox Scandal]]). In an effort to restore confidence, [[Major League Baseball]] established the office of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], and one of [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]'s first acts was to ban all involved players for life.

MLB Rule 21 prohibits players from participating in any form of betting on baseball games, and a lifetime ban on betting on a player's own games.  A poster with Rule 21 must be posted on all professional baseball clubhouses.

===Japan===
{{further|Match fixing in professional sumo}}
{{nihongo|''Yaochō''|八百長}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning a cheating activity which is committed at places where a match, fight, game, competition, or other contest, is held, where the winner and loser are decided in advance by agreement of the competitors or related people. It is believed that the word ''Yaocho'' came from the name ("Chobei") of the owner of a vegetable stand (''yaoya'') during the [[Meiji period]].  Created from the first syllable of ''Yaoya'' and ''chobei'', the word ''yaocho'' was created for a nickname of Chobei. Chobei had a friend called "Isenoumi Godayu" (7th [[Isenoumi stable|Isenoumi]] stablemaster) with whom he played the game [[Go (board game)|Igo]], who had once been a [[sumo]] wrestler "Kashiwado Sogoro" (former ''[[shikona]]'': "Kyonosato") and now was a "''[[toshiyori]]''" (a stablemaster of sumo).  Although Chobei was a better Igo player than Isenoumi, he sometimes lost games on purpose to please Isenoumi, so that Isenoumi would continue to buy merchandise from his shop.  Afterward, once people knew of his cheating, they started to use ''yaocho'' as a word meaning any decision to win/lose a match in advance by negotiation etc. with the expectation of secondary profit, even though the match seems to be held seriously and fairly.

Economists, using statistical analysis, have shown very strong evidence of bout fixing in [[sumo]] wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DugganLevitt2002.pdf |title=Winning Isn’t Everything: Corruption in Sumo Wrestling |author =MARK DUGGAN AND STEVEN D. LEVITT |publisher= THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW |date=December 2002|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the motive for match fixing is helping each other's ranking to keep their salary higher, according to [[Keisuke Itai]]. For example, wrestlers in ''[[jūryō]]'' (the second tier) desperately try to avoid finishing the tournament [[makekoshi|with a losing record (7–8 or worse)]] and exchange or buy the match result otherwise their salary would be nothing, literally 0 yen, with the participation wage of 150,000 yen every two months if they finish the tournament with a losing record, and their ranking would go down to ''[[makushita]]'' (third level) and only participate in seven matches, the lesser ranking from ''[[jūryō]]'' in which one can earn 1,036,000 yen monthly with some prizes and a full 15-match tournament.

The sumo association appears to make a distinction between ''yaocho'' (the payment of money to secure a result) and ''koi-ni-yatta mukiryoku zumo'' (the deliberate performance of underpowered sumo, whereby an opponent simply lays a match down without exchange of money). The intricacies of Japanese culture, which include subordination of individual gain to the greater good, and knowing how to read a situation without the exchange of words (i.e. I know my opponent's score, he needs help and I should automatically give it to him), mean that the latter is almost readily accepted in the sumo world, and is also nigh-impossible to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Sumo-through-Wrestlers-Eyes-ebook/dp/B006C1I5K8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322241344&amp;sr=1-1 | title=Sumo Through the Wrestlers' Eyes | first = Chris | last = Gould | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional wrestling===
{{Main article|Kayfabe}}
In [[professional wrestling]], most matches have predetermined results; however, as it is an [[open secret]] that professional wrestling is staged, it is not considered match fixing.

Up until the 1920s, professional wrestling was a legitimate sport. This did not endure as professional wrestling became identified with modern theatrics or ''admitted fakery'' ("[[kayfabe]]"), moving away from actual competition. The [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] nature of the art have made critics consider it an illegitimate sport, particularly in comparison to [[boxing]], [[amateur wrestling]], and, in more recent times, [[mixed martial arts]].

Many individuals began to doubt the legitimacy of wrestling after the retirement of [[Frank Gotch]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As wrestling's popularity was diving around the same time that [[Major League Baseball]] [[Black Sox Scandal|had its own legitimacy issues]], wrestling started to take on a more worked approach while still appearing as a legitimate sport, beginning with the [[Gold Dust Trio]] of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Even after the formation of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1948, wrestling continued to have legitimacy issues.

Nevertheless, wrestling was still regulated by state athletic commissions in the [[United States]] well into the 1980s, until [[Vince McMahon]], owner of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], convinced the state of [[New Jersey]] in 1989 that wrestling was considered a form of entertainment (or [[sports entertainment]], as McMahon used) rather than as a legitimate sport, and that it should not be regulated by state athletic commissions.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/3/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023145255/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/3/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2009 |work=Sports Illustrated |title=Wrestling with Success |date=25 March 1991 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen as more of a relief to those who had questioned wrestling's legitimacy, since at least one major company (in this case, the WWF) was now publicly willing to admit that wrestling was staged; however, the move did anger many wrestling purists.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

Today, despite the staged aspects of wrestling, it is still seen as a legitimate sport in several countries, such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United Kingdom]], while it is seen as a form of entertainment in the [[United States]] similar to that of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. Due to the lingering legitimacy issues that surrounded wrestling from the 1910s until the 1980s, gambling was generally not allowed on wrestling matches while it was still considered a legitimate sport. Despite wrestling having openly acknowledged that the results are predetermined for years, since the late 2000s gambling has increased on wrestling events, though the maximum bets are kept low due to the matches being predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5788844/the-quirks-of-gambling-on-professional-wrestling|title=The Quirks Of Gambling On Professional Wrestling|author=Barry Petchesky|work=Deadspin|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/a-redditor-has-been-leaking-wwe-outcomes-update-wwe-r-787445495|title=A Redditor Has Been Leaking WWE Outcomes [Update: WWE Response]|author=Barry Petchesky|work=Deadspin|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quiz shows ===
{{main|Quiz show scandals}}
In the 1950's, televised [[quiz show]]s in the United States became the center of a match fixing controversy. At the time, the majority of television programs were effectively controlled by their single sponsors, with broadcasters only providing studios and airtime. 

[[Geritol]]—the sponsor of the new quiz show ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''—was unimpressed by the program, which also struggled in the ratings in comparison to ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''. The company demanded that its producer, [[Barry &amp; Enright Productions]], make changes to ''Twenty-One'' to boost viewer interest and [[Audience measurement|ratings]]. A decision was made to replace the show's current champion, [[Herbert Stempel]], in favor of [[Charles Van Doren]]—a [[Columbia University]] English teacher whom the producers felt would be a more popular contestant—by instructing Stempel to lose his match to his new opponent. In an effort to build hype for the episode where Van Doren would win, the first episode of their match was played to three tie games. Winners of matches received $500 for every point within their margin of victory, but this increased by $500 after every tie game; promotion for the next episode on December 5, 1956 duly-noted that the contestants would be playing for $2,000 per-point. 

In the ensuing episode, after one more tie game, Stempel threw the match to Van Doren as planned. Among the questions Stempel was specifically instructed to answer incorrectly, he guessed  tthat ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' was the winner of [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[28th Academy Awards]]. The correct answer was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', which was also one of Stempel's favorite films. The cancellation of another quiz show, ''[[Dotto]]'', under allegations of rigging, prompted a U.S. government investigation into both shows. The investigation had similarly revealed that [[Revlon]]—the sponsor of ''The $64,000 Question''—had instructed the show's producers to [[Game balance|balance]] the game more favorably towards contestants they felt would be more popular among viewers. The scandal resulted in regulations being implemented to prohibit the rigging of game shows and other contests by broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652498304|title=Television fraud : the history and implications of the quiz show scandals|last=1946-|first=Anderson, Kent,|date=1978|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313389467|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=652498304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/history/2014/12/10/who-cheats-on-a-quiz-show-how-the-1950s-quiz-show-scandals-shaped-tv|title=Who Cheats on a Quiz Show?

The &lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{no selflink|neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt; are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated effects on brain structure, brain function, and [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Erickson KI, Hillman CH, Kramer AF|title=Physical activity, brain, and cognition|journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2015|volume=4|pages=27–32|doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.01.005 | quote = &lt;!--Research in children finds that higher fit and more active preadolescent children show greater hippocampal and basal ganglia volume, greater white matter integrity, elevated and more efficient patterns of brain activity, and superior cognitive performance and scholastic achievement. Higher fit and more physically active older adults show greater hippocampal, prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia volume, greater functional brain connectivity, greater white matter integrity, more efficient brain activity, and superior executive and memory function.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;''Cognitive performance'': Cross-sectional, observational, and randomized clinical trials of PA in late adulthood have demonstrated that engaging in PA may preserve and/or enhance cognitive function even in cognitively impaired individuals (e.g., [18]). Summaries of these studies can now be found in several meta-analyses, most of which confirm that PA positively influences cognitive function in late adulthood with small to moderate sized effects [19]. In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized PA trials, engaging in moderate intensity PA resulted in enhanced cognitive function across all cognitive domains examined, but with the largest effect sizes for indices of executive function [20]. Meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies have also confirmed that self-reported engagement in PA is associated with nearly a 40% reduced risk of experiencing cognitive decline over several years [21]. These, and other studies, make a convincing argument that both continuing to engage in, and starting to engage in, PA in late adulthood may have a profound effect on maintaining cognitive health, improving function, and reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment.&lt;br /&gt;''Brain structure'': There have been now more than 30 published studies of PA or fitness on brain structure in older adults (&gt;60 years) with the majority showing positive associations (see [22]). Such effects are important since increasing age is associated with brain atrophy and loss of volume, which precedes and predicts conversion to dementia. Higher aerobic fitness levels have been associated with larger gray matter volumes in older adults in several areas including the frontal cortex [23,24], hippocampus [25,26], and caudate nucleus [27]. Longitudinal observational studies have also shown that greater amounts of PA are associated with larger gray matter volumes in these regions, and greater volume is, in turn, associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment [28]. These cross-sectional and observational results in older adults are further supported by clinical trials that have shown that six-months to one-year of regular PA is associated with an increase in both frontal cortex [29&lt;sup&gt;••&lt;/sup&gt;,30] and hippocampal volume&amp;nbsp;... These effects on gray matter volume are accompanied by differences found in white matter integrity. For example, several studies have reported that higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels and PA are associated with greater white matter integrity along several tracts linking frontal and subcortical areas [34–36] and that greater changes in fitness after an intervention was associated with an increase in white matter integrity [37]. In sum, there is now convincing evidence that PA and fitness influence brain structure, characterized by both gray matter volume and white matter integrity, in late adulthood.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paillard T, Rolland Y, de Souto Barreto P | title = Protective Effects of Physical Exercise in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review | journal = J Clin Neurol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–219 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26174783 | pmc = 4507374 | doi = 10.3988/jcn.2015.11.3.212 | quote = Aerobic physical exercise (PE) activates the release of neurotrophic factors and promotes angiogenesis, thereby facilitating neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which in turn improve memory and cognitive functions.&amp;nbsp;...

Regular engagement in physical exercise enhances cognitive functioning, increases brain neurotrophic proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and prevents cognitive diseases [76–78]. Recent findings highlight a role for aerobic exercise in modulating chromatin remodelers [21, 79–82].&amp;nbsp;... These results were the first to demonstrate that acute and relatively short aerobic exercise modulates epigenetic modifications. The transient epigenetic modifications observed due to chronic running training have also been associated with improved learning and stress-coping strategies, epigenetic changes and increased c-Fos-positive neurons&amp;nbsp;... Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate the existence of epigenetic changes after acute and chronic exercise and show they are associated with improved cognitive function and elevated markers of neurotrophic factors and neuronal activity (BDNF and c-Fos).&amp;nbsp;... The aerobic exercise training-induced changes to miRNA profile in the brain seem to be intensity-dependent [164]. These few studies provide a basis for further exploration into potential miRNAs involved in brain and neuronal development and recovery via aerobic exercise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent [[aerobic exercise]] (e.g., 30&amp;nbsp;minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain [[cognitive function]]s, healthy alterations in [[gene expression]] in the brain, and beneficial forms of [[neuroplasticity]] and [[behavioral plasticity]]; some of these long-term effects include: increased [[adult neurogenesis|neuron growth]], increased neurological activity (e.g., {{nowrap|[[c-Fos]]}} and [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced [[cognitive control of behavior]], improved [[declarative memory|declarative]], [[spatial memory|spatial]], and [[working memory|working]] memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and [[neural pathways|pathways]] associated with cognitive control and memory.&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comprehensive review"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gomez-Pinilla F, Hillman C | title = The influence of exercise on cognitive abilities | journal = Compr.

Normal aging results in the loss of brain tissue (31), with markedly larger tissue loss evidenced in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (16, 58, 149). As such, cognitive functions subserved by these brain regions (such as those involved in cognitive control and memory) are expected to decay more dramatically than other aspects of cognition. Specifically, age-related decreases in gray matter volume have been associated with decrements in a variety of cognitive control processes.&amp;nbsp;... Decreases in gray matter volume may result from several factors including loss in the number of neurons, neuronal shrinkage, reduction in dendritic arborization, and alterations in glia (158). Further, decreases in white matter (brain tissue composed primarily of myelinated nerve fibers) volume, which represent changes in connectivity between neurons, also occur as a result of aging. Loss of white matter volume further relates to performance decrements on a host of cognitive tasks&amp;nbsp;... aerobic fitness relates to larger hippocampal volume (23) and better relational memory performance (24), during preadolescent childhood.&amp;nbsp;... Specifically, those assigned to the aerobic training group demonstrated increases in gray matter in the frontal lobes, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area, middle frontal gyrus, dorsolateral region of the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior temporal lobe (32). White matter volume changes were also evidenced for the aerobic fitness group with increases in white matter tracts within the anterior third of the corpus callosum (32).&amp;nbsp;...  In addition, aerobic fitness has been shown to promote better functioning of brain, especially in neural networks involved in cognitive control of inhibition and attention (33).&amp;nbsp;... In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain.&amp;nbsp;...

Meta-analyses (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010) suggest that the effects of exercise on the brain might not be uniform across all regions and that some brain areas, specifically those areas supporting executive functions, might be more influenced by participation in exercise than areas not as critically involved in executive functions.&amp;nbsp;...

Data to date from studies of aging provide strong evidence of exercise-linked benefits related to task switching, selective attention, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory capacity; furthermore, cross-sectional fitness data suggest that working memory updating could potentially benefit as well. In young adults, working memory updating is the main executive function shown to benefit from regular exercise, but cross-sectional data further suggest that task-switching and post-error performance may also benefit. In children, working memory capacity has been shown to benefit, and cross-sectional data suggest potential benefits for selective attention and inhibitory control.&amp;nbsp;... Support for the idea that higher levels of aerobic activity may be associated with superior brain structure has been gained through cross-sectional studies in older adults and children (for a recent review, see Voss, Nagamatsu, et al., 2011).&amp;nbsp;... only those in the aerobic exercise group exhibited improved connectivity between the left and right prefrontal cortices, two areas that are crucial to the effective functioning of the fronto-executive network.&amp;nbsp;...

Over a nine-year period, greater amounts of physical activity in the form of walking are associated with greater gray matter volume in several regions including prefrontal, temporal, and hippocampal areas.&amp;nbsp;... The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus deteriorate in late adulthood, preceding and leading to deficits in executive and memory function. We examined in this review the evidence that age-related changes in BDNF might at least partially explain hippocampal atrophy and increased risk for memory impairment. We can conclude that 1) decreases in BDNF protein expression are associated with poorer hippocampal function and increased rates of geriatric depression and AD.&amp;nbsp;... 3) Aerobic exercise enhances executive and memory function and reduces hippocampal atrophy in late adulthood, and this may be partially mediated through a BDNF pathway. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive control of exercise"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley J, Cohen JD, Kramer AF, McAuley E, Mullen SP | title = Cognitive control in the self-regulation of physical activity and sedentary behavior | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 747 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25324754 | pmc = 4179677 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00747 | quote = &lt;!--Recent theory (e.g., Temporal Self-Regulation Theory; Hall and Fong, 2007, 2010, 2013) and evidence suggest that the relation between physical activity and cognitive control is reciprocal (Daly et al., 2013).

Considerable evidence shows that regular physical activity is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, including attention, processing speed, task switching, inhibition of prepotent responses and declarative memory (for reviews see Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010; Guiney and Machado, 2013; McAuley et al., 2013). Recent research demonstrates a dose-response relationship between fitness and spatial memory (Erickson et al., 2011)&amp;nbsp;... The effects of physical activity on cognitive control appear to be underpinned by a variety of brain processes including: increased hippocampal volume, increased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), upregulation of neurotrophins and greater microvascular density&amp;nbsp;... Together, this research suggests that an improvement in control processes, such as attention and inhibition or interference control, is associated with an improvement in self-regulation of physical activity.&amp;nbsp;... Hoang et al. (2013) found that young adults who initially exhibited low levels of physical activity and remained relatively inactive for 25 years had nearly twofold greater odds of impaired executive function compared with those who exhibited higher activity levels; very-low physical activity patterns were associated with even more pronounced declines in executive functioning.&amp;nbsp;… sedentary behavior indirectly led to poor executive function through depressive symptoms (Vance et al., 2005).&amp;nbsp;… sedentary individuals display less capacity to quickly and accurately switch between tasks.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise healthy young adult 2016 SystRev"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox EP, O'Dwyer N, Cook R, Vetter M, Cheng HL, Rooney K, O'Connor H | title = Relationship between physical activity and cognitive function in apparently healthy young to middle-aged adults: A systematic review | journal = J.

In particular, several cross-sectional and intervention studies have shown a positive association between physical activity and cognition in older persons [86] and an inverse correlation with cognitive decline and dementia [87]. Older adults enrolled in a 6-month aerobic fitness intervention increased brain volume in both gray matter (anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal lobe) and white matter (anterior third of corpus callosum) [88]. In addition, Colcombe and colleagues showed that older adults with higher cardiovascular fitness levels are better at activating attentional resources, including decreased activation of the anterior cingulated cortex. One of the possible mechanisms by which physical activity may benefit cognition is that physical activity maintains brain plasticity, increases brain volume, stimulates neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and increases neurotrophic factors in different areas of the brain, possibly providing reserve against later cognitive decline and dementia [89, 90].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of affective state, acute exercise decreases negative affect, increases positive affect, and decreases the psychological and physiological response to acute stress [28]. These effects have been reported to persist for up to 24 hours after exercise cessation [28, 29, 53]. In terms of cognitive functioning, acute exercise primarily enhances executive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex including attention, working memory, problem solving, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, decision making, and inhibitory control [9]. These positive changes have been demonstrated to occur with very low to very high exercise intensities [9], with effects lasting for up to two hours after the end of the exercise bout (Fig. 1A) [27]. Moreover, many of these neuropsychological assessments measure several aspects of behavior including both accuracy of performance and speed of processing. McMorris and Hale performed a meta-analysis examining the effects of acute exercise on both accuracy and speed of processing, revealing that speed significantly improved post-exercise, with minimal or no effect on accuracy [17]. These authors concluded that increasing task difficulty or complexity may help to augment the effect of acute exercise on accuracy.&amp;nbsp;...

====BDNF signaling====
&lt;!--The BDNF article links to the anchor/heading "BDNF signaling"--&gt;{{See also|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor}}
One of the most significant effects of exercise on the brain is the increased synthesis and expression of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]], a [[neuropeptide]] [[peptide hormone|hormone]], in the brain and periphery, resulting in increased signaling through its [[receptor tyrosine kinase]], [[tropomyosin receptor kinase B]] (TrkB).&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trophic factor signaling"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips C, Baktir MA, Srivatsan M, Salehi A | title = Neuroprotective effects of physical activity on the brain: a closer look at trophic factor signaling | journal = Front Cell Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 170 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24999318 | pmc = 4064707 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00170 | quote = &lt;!--Moreover, recent evidence suggests that myokines released by exercising muscles affect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a finding that could lead to the identification of new and therapeutically important mediating factors.&amp;nbsp;... Studies have demonstrated the intensity of exercise training is positively correlated with BDNF plasma levels in young, healthy individuals (Ferris et al., 2007). Resistance exercise has also been shown to elevate serum BDNF levels in young individuals (Yarrow et al., 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that moderate levels of physical activity in people with AD significantly increased plasma levels of BDNF (Coelho et al., 2014).&amp;nbsp;... In humans, it has been shown that 4 h of rowing activity leads to increased levels of plasma BDNF from the internal jugular (an indicator of central release from the brain) and radial artery (an indicator of peripheral release; Rasmussen et al., 2009). Seifert et al. (2010) reported that basal release of BDNF increases following 3 months endurance training in young and healthy individuals, as measured from the jugular vein. These trends are augmented by rodent studies showing that endurance training leads to increased synthesis of BDNF in the hippocampal formation (Neeper et al., 1995, 1996).&amp;nbsp;... Both BDNF and IGF-1 play a significant role in cognition and motor function in humans.&amp;nbsp;... Multiple large-scale studies in humans have shown that serum levels of IGF-1 are correlated with fitness and as well as body mass indices (Poehlman and Copeland, 1990). Furthermore, animal studies have shown that exercise in rats is associated with increased amounts of IGF-1 in the CSF.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ response"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinonen I, Kalliokoski KK, Hannukainen JC, Duncker DJ, Nuutila P, Knuuti J | title = Organ-Specific Physiological Responses to Acute Physical Exercise and Long-Term Training in Humans | journal = Physiology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–436 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25362636 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00067.2013 | quote = &lt;!--The Effects of Acute Exercise&lt;br /&gt;Studies in humans and animals have shown that brain blood flow remains largely unchanged in response to acute exercise[,]&amp;nbsp;... does not increase with increasing exercise intensity[, and]&amp;nbsp;... increased metabolic demands of active brain parts are mostly met by redistributing oxygen supply, although changes in oxygen extraction may also contribute.

This may have links to various cognitive effects of GH and IGF-1. GH and IGF-1 affect the genesis of neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes. Specifically, IGF-1 increases progenitor cell proliferation and numbers of new neurons, oligodendrocytes, and blood vessels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In the adult cerebral cortex IGF-1 only affects oligodendrogenesis.&amp;nbsp;... Altogether, data suggest that both exogenous and endogenous GH and/or IGF-1 may be used as agents to enhance cell genesis and neurogenesis in the adult brain. &amp;nbsp;... GH and IGF-1 have been shown to affect a multitude of mechanisms, including neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, angiogenesis, glutamate receptor activation, cholinergic system, dopaminergic reward system, monoamine abundance, dendritic arborization, astrocyte communication via connexin 43, and opioid receptor abundance&amp;nbsp;... IGF-1 also reaches the brain via both the capillary bed BBB and via the blood-CSF barrier. It appears that IGF-1 uptake is mediated by a specific carrier both in the capillary bed BBB [40] and in the blood-CSF barrier [41, 42]. Moreover, IGF-1 transport across the BBB can be either increased, such as by exercise [43]&amp;nbsp;... Thus, although not fully characterized, there appear to be mechanisms for transport of both GH and IGF-1 across the BBB.&amp;nbsp;...

Investigations looking at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cerebral blood volume in the hippocampus have demonstrated that exercise selectively increased the cerebral blood volume of the dentate gyrus, correlating with post-mortem increase in neurogenesis (Pereira et al. 2007). From a molecular perspective, elevated systemic levels of circulating growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in blood elicited by increased exercise have been shown to mediate, in part, enhancements in neurogenesis (Trejo et al. 2001; Fabel et al. 2003).

In the short term, activation of the HPA axis in response to stress is adaptive. However, long-term stress promoting chronic exposure of tissues to high cortisol concentrations becomes maladaptive.&amp;nbsp;... Exercise, particularly sustained aerobic activity, is a potent stimulus of cortisol secretion. The circulating concentrations of cortisol are directly proportional to the intensity of exercise as measured by oxygen uptake. As is the case for the GH/IGF-1 and HPG axes, the HPA axis also receives many other inputs, including the light/dark cycle, feeding schedules, immune regulation, and many neurotransmitters that mediate the effects of exercise and physical and psychic stress [52].&amp;nbsp;... The HPA is activated by stress, whether physical (exercise) or psychological.&amp;nbsp;... Thus, a negative net energy balance leads to activation of the HPA axis and the circulating concomitants of the catabolic state in an attempt to keep core processes functional, realizing that the stress of exercise has no effect on cortisol and circulating metabolic substrates beyond the impact of the exercise energy expenditure on energy availability [60]. Thuma et al. [61] had already made the important observation that the reported differences in cortisol levels pre- and post-exercise depended on whether this difference was measured from a single pre-test level or from the physiologic circadian baseline as determined in an independent session in the resting state. By this analytical technique, these investigators showed that increasing energy expenditure led to significant cortisol release. This release was apparent if they subtracted the physiologic circadian baseline from the post-exercise value.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt;  Short-term increases in cortisol levels are associated with adaptive cognitive improvements, such as enhanced inhibitory control;&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise neuroendocrine effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt; however, excessively high exposure or prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol causes impairments in cognitive control and has [[neurotoxic]] effects in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner NC, Kamin H, Diaz V, Cohen RA, MacDonald K | title = Hormones as "difference makers" in cognitive and socioemotional aging processes | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1595 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25657633 | pmc = 4302708 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01595 | quote = &lt;!-- It is known that chronically elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol exert neurotoxic effects on the aging brain with negative impacts on cognition and socioemotional functioning.&amp;nbsp;... Cortisol is a steroid hormone released by the HPA axis in response to challenging situations. As the primary effector of the biological stress response in humans, it is implicated in a diverse array of physiologic, metabolic, immunologic, and psychological processes directed toward successful coping (Sapolsky et al., 2000; Kassel and Herrlich, 2007). Cortisol receptors are well-represented in limbic structures involved in affective response (i.e., hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala) and in regions central to executive function such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Dedovic et al., 2009; Joëls and Baram, 2009). As a result, the effects of cortisol extend beyond the stress and threat response system to impact mood, attention, and memory (Lupien and McEwen, 1997; Sapolsky et al., 2000; de Kloet et al., 2005).&amp;nbsp;... In contrast, evidence indicated positive associations between cortisol levels that were acutely elevated by stress or hydrocortisone administration and inhibitory control (Schlosser et al., 2013) as well as spatial learning (Meyer et al., 2013). Regarding cortisol’s effect on memory, the evidence is currently mixed (Schwabe et al., 2012; van Ast et al., 2013).&amp;nbsp;... There also is evidence that effects of cortisol on cognition vary in a dose-dependent fashion. In particular, there is evidence of cognitive improvements under conditions of moderate, time-limited cortisol elevation but evidence of cognitive impairments when cortisol concentrations are persistent or excessively high (Lupien et al., 1999; Abercrombie et al., 2003; Hupbach and Fieman, 2012; Schilling et al., 2013; Moriarty et al., 2014).--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chronic psychological stress decreases {{abbr|BDNF|brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} expression which has detrimental effects on hippocampal volume and can lead to [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Stress" /&gt;

For example, Rimelle et al. [123] documented significantly lower cortisol and heart rate responses to psychosocial stress (Trier social stress test) in trained men compared with untrained men. Moreover, significantly greater calmness and better mood, and a trend towards lower state anxiety, were noted in these trained men during the stress protocol.&amp;nbsp;...

Animal studies found EX-induced changes in different neurotransmitters such as serotonin and endorphins [10,11], which relate to mood, and positive effects of EX on stress reactivity (e.g., the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis [12,13]). Finally, anxiolytic effects of EX mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide have been reported [14].

Since then, other human studies have shown increased blood concentrations of AEA&amp;nbsp;... A dependence of the increase of AEA concentration on exercise intensity has also been documented. Plasma levels of AEA significantly increased upon 30 min of moderate exercise (heart rate of 72 and 83 %), but not at lower and significantly higher exercise intensities, where the age-adjusted maximal heart rate was 44 and 92 %, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Several experimental data support the hypothesis that ECS might, at least in part, explain PA effects on brain functions, because: (1) CB1 is the most abundant GPCR in the brain participating in neuronal plasticity [18]; (2) eCBs are involved in several brain responses that greatly overlap with the positive effects of exercise; (3) eCBs are able to cross the blood–brain barrier [95]; and (4) exercise increases {{abbr|eCB|endocannabinoid}} plasma levels [64–67].--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that aerobic exercise causes an increase in plasma anandamide levels, where the magnitude of this increase is highest at moderate exercise intensity ( i.e., exercising at ~⁠70⁠–⁠80⁠% maximum heart rate).&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Increases in plasma anandamide levels are associated with [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive effects]] because anandamide is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and act within the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Thus, because anandamide is a euphoriant and aerobic exercise is associated with euphoric effects, it has been proposed that anandamide partly mediates the short-term mood-lifting effects of exercise (e.g., the euphoria of a runner's high) via exercise-induced increases in its synthesis.&lt;ref name="Primary-Runner's high definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt;

A popular belief has been that endogenous endorphins mediate these beneficial effects. However, running exercise increases blood levels of both β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid). Using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, we demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors mediate acute anxiolysis and analgesia after running. We show that anxiolysis depends on intact cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors on forebrain GABAergic neurons and pain reduction on activation of peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors. We thus demonstrate that the endocannabinoid system is crucial for two main aspects of a runner's high. Sedation, in contrast, was not influenced by cannabinoid or opioid receptor blockage, and euphoria cannot be studied in mouse models. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2016}}

Sibley and Etnier (2003) performed a meta-analysis that looked at the relationship between physical activity and cognitive performance in children.&lt;ref name=sibley/&gt; They reported a beneficial relationship in the categories of perceptual skills, intelligence quotient, achievement, verbal tests, mathematic tests, developmental level/academic readiness and other, with the exception of memory, that was found to be unrelated to physical activity.&lt;ref name=sibley&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Sibley BA, Etnier JL | year = 2003 | title = The Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition in Children: A Meta-Analysis | url = | journal = Pediatric Exercise Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 243–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation was strongest for the age ranges of 4–7 and 11–13 years.&lt;ref name=sibley /&gt; On the other hand, Chaddock and colleagues (2011) found results that contrasted Sibley and Etnier's meta-analysis.

[[File:Nordic Walkers near Ilkley 020.JPG|thumb|300px|Nordic Walkers in [[Ilkley]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]
'''Nordic walking''' is a total body version of [[walking]] that can be enjoyed both by non-athletes as a health-promoting physical activity, and by athletes as a sport. The activity is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to [[ski poles]].

==History==
Nordic walking (originally Finnish sauvakävely) is fitness walking with specially designed poles. While trekkers, backpackers and skiers had been using the basic concept for decades, Nordic Walking was first formally defined with the publication of "''Hiihdon lajiosa''" (translation: "A part of cross-country skiing training methodic") by [[Mauri Repo]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tul.fi/Portals/0/DOKUMENTIT/Koulutus/Vanhat%20materiaalit/Hiihdon%20lajiosa%201979.pdf|format=PDF|title=KOULUTUSAINEISTOA MAURI REPO : SEURAVALMENTAJAN PERUSTIEDOT HIIHDON LAJIOSA|website=Tul.fi|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{wikisource-inline|Hiihdon lajiosa}}.)'' Nordic Walking's concept was developed on the basis of off-season ski-training activity while using one-piece ski poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inwa-nordicwalking.com/?p=202#more-202|title=The History of Nordic Walking|website=Inwa-nordic-walking.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Скандинавская ходьба (Украина).jpg|thumb|]]

For decades hikers and backpackers used their one-piece ski poles long before trekking and Nordic walking poles came onto the scene. Ski racers deprived of snow have always used and still do use their one-piece ski poles for ski walking and hill bounding. The first poles specially designed and marketed to fitness walkers were produced by Exerstrider of the USA in 1988. ''Nordic Walker'' poles were produced and marketed by [[Exel Composites|Exel]] in 1997. Exel coined and popularized the term 'Nordic Walking' in 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Benefits==
Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace.&lt;ref&gt;Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise VOL. 27, NO. 4 April1995:607-11&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Institute, ''Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Field testing of physiological responses associated with Nordic Walking|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=12230336 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2002.10609023 |volume=73 |journal=Res Q Exerc Sport |pages=296–300 | last1 = Church | first1 = TS | last2 = Earnest | first2 = CP | last3 = Morss | first3 = GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the research, conducted by the group scientists from various universities*, both Nordic walking and conventional walking are beneficial for older adults. However, Nordic walking provides additional benefits in muscular strength compared to conventional walking, making it suitable for improving aerobic capacity and muscular strength as well as other components of functional fitness in a short period of time. 
The key  points stated by the study authors are:
Nordic walking, conventional walking, and resistance training are beneficial for older adults.
*Nordic walking and conventional walking both improve cardio-respiratory fitness while resistance training does not.
*Nordic walking provides additional benefits in upper-body muscular strength compared to conventional walking.
*Nordic walking is an effective and efficient mode of exercise to improve overall fitness in older adults.

==Equipment==
[[File:Рукоять и темляк палок для скандинавской ходьбы.jpg|thumb|The handle of a walking pole]]
[[File:Push and Pull.jpg|thumb|Spike for offroad and rubber for asphalt]]
Nordic walking poles are significantly shorter than those recommended for cross-country skiing. Nordic walking poles come in one-piece, non-adjustable shaft versions, available in varying lengths, and telescoping two or three piece twist-locking versions of adjustable length. One piece poles are generally stronger and lighter, but must be matched to the user.  Telescoping poles are 'one-size fits all', and are more transportable.

Nordic walking poles feature a range of grips and wrist-straps, or rarely, no wrist-strap at all. The straps eliminate the need to tightly grasp the grips.
As with many trekking poles, Nordic walking poles come with removable [[Natural rubber|rubber]] tips for use on hard surfaces and hardened metal tips for trails, the beach, snow and ice. Most poles are made from lightweight [[aluminium]], [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Special walking shoes are not required, although there are shoes being marketed as specifically designed for the sport.

==Technique==
The cadences of the arms, legs and body are, rhythmically speaking, similar to those used in normal, vigorous, walking. The range of arm movement regulates the length of the stride. Restricted arm movements will mean a natural restricted pelvic motion and stride length. The longer the pole thrust, the longer the stride and more powerful the swing of the pelvis and upper torso.

[[File:New York Red Bulls vs CD FAS (15264450902).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Squad number, as depicted on an [[association football]] jersey.]]

In [[team sport|team]] sports, the '''number''', often referred to as the '''uniform number''', '''squad number''', '''jersey number''', '''shirt number''', '''sweater number''', or similar (with such naming differences varying by sport and region) is the number worn on a player's [[uniform]], to identify and distinguish each player (and sometimes others, such as coaches and [[official (sports)|officials]]) from others wearing the same or similar uniforms. The number is typically displayed on the rear of the [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]], often accompanied by the surname.  Sometimes it is also displayed on the front and/or sleeves, or on the player's shorts or headgear. It is used to identify the player to officials, other players, official scorers, and spectators; in some sports, it is also indicative of the player's position.

The [[International Federation of Football History and Statistics]], an organization of association football historians, traces the origin of numbers to a 1911 [[Australian rules football]] match in Sydney,&lt;ref name="IFFHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?3e1d08361d1529774c8c03fcf8031f |title=Droll facts: 1911 |author=IFFHS Team |others=Dr. Alejandro Rodón (trans.) |accessdate=8 January 2010 |website=www.iffhs.de }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}} although photographic evidence exists of numbers being used in Australia as early as May 1903.&lt;ref name=austfb-jpg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianfootball.com/uploads/default/images/page_content/2012/07/5becd.FitzVColl1903.jpg |title=Maroons and Magpies fight for points in Sydney |website=australianfootball.com |date=May 1903 |format=JPG |accessdate=4 August 2013}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Player numbers were used in a Queensland vs. New Zealand [[rugby union|rugby]] match played on 17 July 1897, in Brisbane, Australia, as reported in the ''[[Brisbane Courier]].''&lt;ref name=tbc-17jul1897&gt;{{cite news |title=Football - New Zealand v. Queensland |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3654633 |accessdate=29 November 2014 |work=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |issue=Issue 12,828 |date=17 July 1897 |pages=6, col. 3 |format=scan |volume=Vol. 54 |via=trove.nla.gov.au}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
{{Main|Squad number (association football)}}

[[File:Ronaldinho_corner.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Brazilian star [[Ronaldinho]] wore number 10 during his tenure on [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], then switching to number 80 when he was traded to [[AC Milan|Milan]]]]

In association football, numbers were traditionally assigned based on a player's position or reputation on the field, with the starting 11 players wearing 1 to 11, and the substitutes wearing higher numbers. The [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] would generally wear number 1, then defenders, midfield players and forwards in ascending order.

Numbers being assigned to each player in a squad was initiated for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], where each man in a country's 22-man squad wore a specific number from 1 to 22 for the duration of the tournament. In 1993, England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] switched to persistent squad numbers, abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting line-up. It became standard in the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] in the 1993–94 season, with names printed above the numbers. Most European top leagues adopted the system over the next five years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is common for players to change numbers within a club as their career progresses. For example, [[Cesc Fàbregas]] was first assigned the number 57 on arrival at [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] in 2003. On promotion to the first team squad he was switched to number 15 before inheriting his preferred number 4 following the departure of [[Patrick Vieira]].

Very high numbers, the most common being 88, are often reserved and used as a placeholder, when a new player has been signed and played by the manager prior to having a formal squad number. However, in some countries these high numbers are well used, in some cases because the players preferred number is already taken or for other reasons. On joining [[A.C. Milan]]; [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Mathieu Flamini]] all wore numbers reflecting the year of their birth (76, 80 &amp; 84 respectively), because their preferred numbers were already being worn.

==Australian rules football==
[[File:Port Adelaide number panel 1910.png|thumb|right|140px|Squad numbers first appeared on [[Australian rules football]] guernseys when clubs travelled interstate. Pictured is a {{AFL Por}} player in [[Western Australia]] during 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33369597 |title=PORT ADELAIDE V. GOLDFIELDS. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Western Argus]] |volume=XVI, |issue=822 |location=Western Australia |date=9 August 1910 |accessdate=5 November 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[Australian rules football]], players traditionally wear numbers on the backs of their [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]s, although some competitions (the [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] is one example) may feature teams who wear smaller numbers on the front, usually on one side of the chest. The number being worn is usually not relevant to the player's position on the ground, although occasionally a club will allocate the number 1 guernsey or an otherwise prestigious number to the team [[Captain (Australian rules football)|captain]] (such as the [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] football club, which allocates number 17 to its team captain in honour of [[Jack Dyer]], who wore that number with distinction). [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] assigns number 1 to the team captain. In these situations, it is usually customary for players who relinquish the captaincy to switch to another.

[[Australian Football League|AFL]] clubs generally do not retire numbers (although [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] temporarily retired the no. 5 between 1998 and 2005 after the retirement of [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett Sr.]]), but instead will often choose to give their more prestigious numbers to highly touted draftees or young up-and-coming players who are shown to have promise and may share certain traits with the previous wearer, such as position or playing style. For example, as of 2010, [[Michael Hurley (footballer)|Michael Hurley]] inherited the no. 18 jumper left vacant by the retired [[Matthew Lloyd]], effectively keeping the no. 18 in [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon's]] goal-square for another era.

Sons of famous players will often take on their father's number, especially if they play at the same club. [[Sergio Silvagni]] and his son [[Stephen Silvagni|Stephen]], for example, both wore number 1 for [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], with Stephen's son [[Jack Silvagni|Jack]] later following suit. [[Matthew Scarlett]] wore his father [[John Scarlett (footballer)|John's]] no. 30 at [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. In contrast, some sons of famous players also prefer to take on other numbers in the hopes that it will reduce the burden of having to fulfill high expectations. Notable examples of this are [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett Jr.]] at Geelong (who wore no. 29 instead of his [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|father's]] no. 5) and [[Jobe Watson]] at Essendon, who passed up [[Tim Watson|Tim's]] no. 32 in favour of no. 4.

Clubs will often feature retiring champions "passing on" their famous guernsey numbers to the chosen successors, usually in ceremonial fashion, such as a club function or press conference.

The highest number worn in a VFL/AFL game is number 65 by Andrew Witts of Collingwood for seven games in 1985. With the demise of Reserves and Under 19's teams and, consequently, smaller club playing lists, it is unlikely that any player will play AFL-level football wearing so high a number again.

==American football==
{{Main|Uniform number (American football)}}

===NFL===
[[File:Peyton Manning Broncos 2012.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Quarterbacks, like [[Peyton Manning]], generally possess a squad number from 1 to 19.]] {{main|National Football League uniform numbers}}

The [[National Football League|NFL]] has used uniform numbers since its inception; through the 1940s, there was no standard numbering system, and teams were free to number their players however they wanted. An informal tradition had arisen by that point that was similar to the modern system; when the [[All-America Football Conference]], which used a radically different numbering scheme, merged with the NFL in 1950, the resulting confusion forced the merged league to impose a mandatory system of assignment of jersey numbers in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/history/record_book/results_and_rosters/all_time_jersey_numbers/ Packers.com » History » Record Book » Results And Rosters » All Time Jersey Numbers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092731/http://www.packers.com/history/record_book/results_and_rosters/all_time_jersey_numbers/ |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was updated and made more rigid in 1973, and has been modified slightly since then.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/a/bl_numbersystem.htm Football 101 – Uniform Numbering System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are always worn on the front and back of a player's jersey, and so-called "TV numbers" are worn on either the sleeve or shoulder. The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] were the last NFL team to wear jerseys without TV numbers on a regular basis in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], though since then several NFL teams have worn [[throwback uniforms]] without them, as their jersey designs predated the introduction of TV numbers. Players' last names, however, are required on all uniforms, even throwbacks which predate the last name rule. Since [[2008 NFL season|2008]], TV numbers have not been mandatory under NFL rules{{Citation needed|reason=There has not been an article mentioning this, and proof needs to be shown.|date=January 2012}}.

Some uniforms also feature numbers either on the front, back, or sides of the helmet (in pro football, these were most prominently worn on the [[San Diego Chargers]] "powder-blue" uniforms).  Players have often asked the NFL for an exception to the numbering rule; with very few exceptions (see, for example, [[Keyshawn Johnson]]), these requests are almost always denied.

Below is the numbering system established by the NFL.  It has been primarily unchanged since 1973, though small changes have been made on occasion since then, including opening up the 10-19 range for wide receivers in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alder|first1=James|title=Rules Changes for the '04 NFL Season |url=http://football.about.com/od/nationalfootballleague/a/04rulechanges.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening 40-49 up to linebackers in 2015, with the latter decree being named the "Brian Bosworth rule", who wanted to wear 44, but was ordered to change it to 55.&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/25/nfl-passes-brian-bosworth-rule-linebackers-can-now-wear-jerseys-numbered-40-49/&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, numbers 50-59 were opened to defensive linemen; the first benefactor was [[Jerry Hughes]].

* '''1–9''': [[quarterbacks]], [[placekicker|kickers]], and [[Punter (football position)|punters]]
* '''10–19''': quarterbacks, kickers, punters, and [[wide receiver]]s
* '''20–39''': [[running back]]s and [[defensive back]]s
* '''40–49''': running backs, defensive backs, [[linebackers]], and [[tight end]]s
* '''50–59''': linebackers, [[Lineman (American football)|defensive linemen]], and [[Center (American football)|center]]s
* '''60–79''': [[offensive linemen]] and [[defensive linemen]]
* '''80–89''': wide receivers and tight ends
* '''90–99''': linebackers and defensive linemen

Numbers 0 and 00 are no longer allowed, but they were issued in the NFL before the number standardization in 1973.  [[George Plimpton]] wore 0 during a brief preseason stint as [[quarterback]] for the [[Detroit Lions]]. [[Jim Otto]] ("aught-oh") wore number "00"  during most of his career with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Wide receiver [[Ken Burrough]] of the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] also wore "00" during his NFL career in the 1970s.

This NFL numbering system is based on a player's ''primary'' position. Any player wearing any number may play at any position at any time (though players wearing numbers 50–79 or 90-99 must let the referee know that they are playing out of position by reporting as an "ineligible number in an eligible position"). It is not uncommon for running backs to line up at wide receiver on certain plays, or to have a lineman or linebacker play at fullback or tight end in short yardage situations. If a player changes primary positions, he is not required to change his number unless he changes from an eligible position to an ineligible one or vice versa. In preseason games, when teams have expanded rosters, players may wear numbers that are outside of the above rules. When the final 53-player roster is established, they are reissued numbers within the above guidelines.

===College and high school===

In [[college football]] and [[high school football]], a less rigid numbering system is employed.  The only rule is that members of the offensive line (centers, guards, and tackles) that play in ''ineligible'' positions (those that may not receive forward passes) must wear numbers from 50 to 79.  Informally, certain conventions still hold, and players often wear numbers in the ranges similar to their NFL counterparts; though the lowest numbers are often the highest prestige, and thus are often worn by players at any position.  Kickers and punters are frequently numbered in the 40's or 90's, which are the least in-demand numbers on a college roster.  The increased flexibility in numbering of NCAA rosters is needed because NCAA rules allow 85 scolarship players and rosters of over 100 players total; thus teams would frequently exhaust the available numbers for a position under the NFL rules.

One oddity of college football is that the same squad number can be shared by two (or more) players, e.g., an offensive and a defensive player.  Usually one of the players is a reserve who rarely plays but there are exceptions:   In the 2009 and 2010 seasons, that same number (5) was worn by [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] starting [[quarterback]] [[Stephen Garcia]] and starting [[cornerback]] [[Stephon Gilmore]]. Gilmore was also used as a [[Wildcat formation|wildcat]] quarterback in games against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] in 2009 and [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]] in 2010. The player change, since both players wore the same number, caused some confusion among opposing defenses, but was legal, since both players were not on the field at the same time.  In [[2012 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2012]], the No. 5 was worn by two [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] starters—quarterback [[Everett Golson]] and [[linebacker]] [[Manti Te'o]].

==Baseball==
{{main|Uniform number (Major League Baseball)}}

In baseball, players generally wear large numbers on the back of their jersey. Some jerseys may also feature smaller numerals in other locations, such as on the sleeves, pants, or front of the shirt. The purpose of numerals in baseball is to allow for easy identification of players. Some players have been so associated with specific numbers that their jersey number has been officially "[[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retired]]". The first team to retire a number was the [[New York Yankees]], who retired [[Lou Gehrig]]'s #4 in 1939.

In the early years of baseball, teams did not wear uniform numbers. Teams experimented with uniform numbers during the first two decades of the 20th century, with the first [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] team to use them being the [[1916 Cleveland Indians season|1916 Cleveland Indians]] which used them for a few weeks before abandoning the experiment. Again in 1923, the [[1923 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] tried out uniforms with small numbers on the sleeves, but the players did not like them, and they were removed. For the [[1929 Major League Baseball season]] both the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Cleveland Indians]] put numbers on their jerseys, the first two teams to do so, beginning a trend that was completed by 1937, when the [[1937 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]] became the last team to permanently add numbers to their jerseys.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lukas|first1=Paul|title=Uni Watch: Who needs uniform numbers?|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/1005/uni-watch-who-needs-uniform-numbers|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=2 October 2014|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/numbers.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame - Dressed to the Nines - Parts of the Uniform |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no system for numbering players in baseball, though in the very early years some teams did employ their own systems. The [[1929 New York Yankees season|1929 New York Yankees]] handed out uniform numbers based on a player's position in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]; which is why [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]] wore their famous numbers 3 and 4; they batted third and fourth respectively that season. Numbers 1–8 were assigned to the regular starters at their respective batting order positions, numbers 9 and 10 were assigned to the Yankees two backup catchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yankees Uniforms and Logos|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/uniforms_logos.jsp|website=mlb.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while pitchers and backup fielders were assigned higher numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929 New York Yankees|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/roster.php?y=1929&amp;t=NYA|website=Baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there is no rhyme or reason to a player's uniform number, players may pick their own number for personal reasons, or accept a number assigned by the team.

Catcher [[Benito Santiago]] is the only major league baseball player (or any major professional sportsman) known to have worn a leading zero; Santiago wore the number 09 from 1991 to 1994 in an effort to make his uniform more comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.sbnation.com/2010/6/9/1509573/cubs-select-benito-santiago-jr-mlb-draft Cubs select Benito Santiago, Jr.] ''SB Nation'' (9 June 2010). Retrieved 22 September 2014. "insisted on wearing number ‘09’ because he claimed having the single digit in the middle of his jersey felt "weird" with the chest protector strap on top of it."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Gaedel]], the midget at the center of an infamous stunt by [[Bill Veeck]]'s [[St. Louis Browns]], is the only known major leaguer to have worn a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] ({{fraction|1|8}}, which he had borrowed from the Browns' batboy) as his jersey number.

==Canadian football==
[[Canadian football]] follows the same general rules as American football, with some minor exceptions.  In the original numbering system, offensive linemen wore numbers from 40–69 and numbers 70–79 were allocated to receivers. A rules change in 2008 switched numbers 40–49 from offensive linemen to eligible receivers.  Any eligible player, whether he is a quarterback, running back, receiver, or a kicker, can wear any eligible number. [[Doug Flutie]] wore his Boston College number of 22 when he played quarterback for the [[BC Lions]] and No. 20 for the [[Calgary Stampeders]].  Currently, numbers 1–49 and 70–89 are eligible while 50–69 are not. Numbers 90–99 are generally worn on defense although in the early days of the [[Canadian Football League]], 90s were common on offense. The number 0 is also allowed in the CFL. A defensive player can wear any number he chooses, regardless of the position he plays.

==Rugby league==
{{Further|Rugby league positions}}

In [[rugby league]] each of the thirteen positions on the field traditionally has an assigned shirt number, for example fullback is "1". In recent times squad numbering has been used for marketing purposes in the [[Super League]] competition. In Super League each player is given a squad number for the whole season, the first choice starting line-up at the beginning of the season will usually be given shirts 1–13 but as interchanges (substitutions) occur during the game and injuries etcetera occur during the season, it is less likely that the number a player wears will match the position they are playing.

Furthermore, a growing number of teams in both Australia and England (such as [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]]), as well as most major representative teams, have adopted the cricket custom of "club numbers", in which each player is given a unique number in the order of when he made his first senior appearance for a specific side. These numbers are typically small and embroidered above or below the club crest on a player's shirt.

==Rugby union==

When included in the starting line-up, a player's rugby shirt number usually determines their position. Numbers 1–8 are the 'forwards', and 9–15 the 'backs'. [[Rugby union]] even has a position named simply after the shirt normally worn by that player in the "Number 8" position. Several clubs (Leicester and Bristol particularly) used letters instead of numbers on shirts, although have now fallen into line with the rest of the clubs.

==Gaelic Games==
{{main|Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions}}
In [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[camogie]], the goal keeper generally wears the number 1 shirt, and the rest of the starting team wears numbers 2–15, increasing from right to left and from defence to attack: substitutes' numbers start from 16.

==Cricket==

The 1995–96 [[World Series Cup]] in Australia saw the first use of shirt numbers in international [[cricket]], with most players assigned their number and some players getting to choose their number, most notably [[Shane Warne]] wearing 23 as it was his number when he played junior [[Aussie Rules]] for [[St Kilda Football Club]]. Other countries soon adopted the practice, although players would typically have different numbers for each tournament, and it was several years later that players would consistently wear the same number year-round. [[Ricky Ponting]] (14) still uses the same number as in that initial season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/209641.html Cricinfo – Australian ODI shirt numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Player numbering was first used in the [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1999, where the [[captain (cricket)|captains]] wore the number 1 jersey and the rest of the squad was numbered from 2 to 15. An exception was that South African captain [[Hansie Cronje]] retained his usual number 5 with opener [[Gary Kirsten]] wearing the number 1 which he had also done previously.

Shirt numbers no longer remain exclusive to the [[Short form cricket|short forms of the game]], and navy blue numbers are now used on the playing whites in the [[Sheffield Shield]] to aid spectators in distinguishing players. However, a recent fashion that has been taken up by several nations is the process of giving a player making his Test debut an appearance number, along with his Test cap, for reasons of historical continuity. The number represents how many players have made their Test debuts including the one wearing it. If two or more players make their debut in the same match, they are given numbers alphabetically based on surname. For example, Thomas Armitage is Test player Number 1 for England. He made his debut in the very first Test Match, against Australia, on 15 March 1877, and was first in alphabetical order on England's team. [[Mason Crane]] made his debut for England on 4 January 2018 against Australia; his number is 683. These numbers can be found on a player's Test uniform, but it is always in discreet small type on the front, and never displayed prominently.

==Basketball==
[[File:Shaq and Nash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Steve Nash]] wearing their numbers in the [[Phoenix Suns]].]]
American basketball leagues at all levels traditionally use single and double digits from 0 to 5 (i.e. 0, 00, 1–5, 10–15, 20–25, 30–35, 40–45, and 50–55).  The [[NCAA]] and most amateur competitions mandate that only these numbers be used. This eases non-verbal communication between referees, who use fingers to denote a player's number, and the official scorer. In college basketball, single-digit players' numbers are officially recorded as having a [[leading zero]]. Teams can have either a "0" or "00", but they cannot have both.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/numerals-on-college-basketball-jerseys-you-can-count-them-on-one-hand.html|title=Crunching the Numbers: College Basketball Players Can’t Wear 6, 7, 8 or 9|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 March 2015|first=Zach|last=Schonbrun}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule about "0" and "00" also applies to the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;http://friends.mavs.com/profiles/blogs/drew-gooden-q-amp-a&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Utah Jazz]] center [[Greg Ostertag]] changed from "00" to "39" so [[Olden Polynice]] could wear No. 0 and in 2003, [[Washington Wizards]] center [[Brendan Haywood]] switched from No. 00 to No. 33 so [[Gilbert Arenas]] (who had the nickname "Agent Zero" already at this point) could wear #0. However, during the 2015–16 season, the [[Denver Nuggets]] played with two players wearing ''both'' 0 and 00 ([[Emmanuel Mudiay]] and [[Darrell Arthur]] respectively), with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] ([[Kevin Love]] and [[Chris Andersen]] respectively) and [[Indiana Pacers]] ([[C. J. Miles]] and [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]] respectively) continuing the trend the following season.

The [[National Basketball Association]] has always allowed other numbers from 0 to 99, but use of digits 6 through 9 is less common than 0 through 5 since most players tend to keep the numbers that they had previously worn in college. However, with the increase in the number of international players, and other players who have been on national (FIBA) teams who change NBA teams and cannot keep their number with the previous team because another player has worn it or is retired, players have adopted such higher numbers ([[Patrick Ewing]] with No. 6 in [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]]). When [[Michael Jordan]] retired in 1993, the [[Chicago Bulls]] retired his 23; when he came out of retirement he chose to wear 45 until, during the 1995 NBA post-season, he went back to his familiar 23. Also, players cannot change numbers midseason, but they used to be able to ([[Andre Iguodala]] and [[Antoine Wright (basketball player)|Antoine Wright]] changed from No. 4 and No. 15 to No. 9 and No. 21 for [[Chris Webber]] and [[Vince Carter]], respectively). Since [[Kelenna Azubuike]] was inactive all season, [[Carmelo Anthony]] was able to wear Azubuike's No. 7 when traded to the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] in 2011, but since [[Rodney Stuckey]] was active, [[Allen Iverson]] could not wear No. 3 when traded to the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] in 2009. (Anthony would not have been able to wear his normal No. 15 anyway and would have had to trade jerseys; the Knicks have retired the jersey number.)

Up to 2014, players in [[FIBA]]-organized competitions for national teams, including the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] and [[FIBA World Championship for Women|Women's World Championship]], had to wear numbers from 4 to 15. Under FIBA rules, national federations could also allow any numbers with a maximum of 2 digits for their own competitions; this rule also applied in transnational club competitions, most notably the [[EuroLeague]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Basketball Rules 2008, FIBA, Art. 4.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; At present, players are allowed any numbers from 1 to 99, additionally 0 and 00.&lt;ref&gt;Official Basketball Rules 2014, FIBA, Art. 4.3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handball==
In [[handball]] the number has to be at least 20&amp;nbsp;cm high in the back and 10&amp;nbsp;cm in the front.

According to the [[International Handball Federation]] the numbers from 1 to 99 should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf#page=16|title=IX.

The goalkeeper has often the number 12 or 1 also common is the number 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/trikotnummern-im-handball-die-glueckszahlen-a-746830.html|title=Die Glückszahlen|last=Boysen|first=Stefan|date=2011-02-24|website=Spiegel|language=German|trans-title=The lucky numbers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309165410/http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/trikotnummern-im-handball-die-glueckszahlen-a-746830.html|archive-date=2018-03-09|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field player has often the other numbers from 1 to 20. Sometimes the players has also the last two digits of the year of their birth.

The first group to use numbers on [[ice hockey]] players' uniforms is a matter of some debate. The [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] is sometimes credited with being the first to use numbered sweaters, but the [[National Hockey Association]], the predecessor of the [[National Hockey League]], is known to have required its players to wear numbered armbands beginning with the [[1911–12 NHA season|1911–12 season]], which may have come before that.&lt;ref name=impressions&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLaere|first=Matt|title=What's in a Number?|publisher=''Impressions''|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|url=https://www.impressionsmagazine.com/digital-decorating/heat-transfer/whats-in-a-number/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patrick brothers who founded the PCHA put numbers on players' backs so they could sell programs in which the players were listed by their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver brother sculpted game of hockey 100 years before Canucks vied for Cup|url=https://thehockeynews.com/news/article/vancouver-brothers-sculpted-game-of-hockey-100-years-before-canucks-vied-for-cup|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To start the [[1977–78 NHL season|1977–78 season]], the NHL placed into effect a rule that also required sweaters to display the names of the players wearing them, but [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Harold Ballard]] initially refused to abide by it, fearing that he would not be able to sell programs at his team's games. The NHL responded by threatening to levy a fine on the team in February 1978, so Ballard started having names put on the jerseys but made them the same color as the background they were on, which for the team's road jerseys was blue. The League threatened further sanctions, and despite playing more than one game with their "unreadable" sweaters, Ballard's Maple Leafs finally complied in earnest by making the blue jerseys' letters white.&lt;ref name=impressions/&gt;

The very first jersey number to be retired in professional sports was that of an NHL player - [[Ace Bailey]], whose #6 was retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1934 following a career-ending fight with [[Eddie Shore]] during a game against the [[Boston Bruins]] in 1933. Shore injured Bailey under the mistaken impression that Bailey had hip-checked him when it was actually fellow Maple Leaf [[Rod Horner]]. To aid Bailey, the NHL hosted [[Ace Bailey Benefit Game|a benefit game between the Maple Leafs and an all-star team]], at which Maple Leafs owner [[Conn Smythe]] retired his number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Nick|title=Who Had the First Jersey Number to Be Retired in Sports?|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=7 November 2014|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59830/who-had-first-jersey-number-be-retired-sports|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers used in the National Hockey League===

{{incomplete section|more than just the use of the number 1 in here|date=August 2018}}
Historically, starting NHL [[goaltender]]s wore number 1. Popular belief holds that this was because the goaltender was the first player on the rink from the perspective of one standing in front of the net; this is also believed to be why replacement goaltenders would also wear the number. Further use of the number 1 among goaltenders can be attributed to adherence to tradition.&lt;ref name=goalie1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinchevsky|first=Tal|title=Why goalies are increasingly ditching traditional No. 1|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=30 November 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/18268822/nhl-goalies-increasingly-ditching-traditional-no-1-other-numbers-their-sweaters|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the number 1 became less common among goaltenders, with only seven using it as of December 2016. One reason was that goaltenders increasingly followed the example set by the Toronto Maple Leafs' [[Terry Sawchuk]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' [[Patrick Roy]] after the NHL mandated that each team have two goaltenders in every game. In 1964, Sawchuk joined the Maple Leafs wearing 24 as the number 1 was already being used, but switched to 30, whereas Roy donned 33 as his team already had a player with the number 30, starting a trend of goaltenders using numbers in the 30s. Furthermore, seven franchises have retired the number 1—six in honor of players, and the [[Minnesota Wild]] in honor of its fanbase—making it unavailable. As a result, fewer goalies have chosen the traditional number 1 and instead have opted for more distinctive numbers, or numbers of their favourite goalies. Notable examples include [[Corey Crawford]] wearing 50 for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Braden Holtby]] wearing 70 for the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] wearing 72 for the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]], and [[Andrei Vasilevskiy]] wearing 88 for the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].&lt;ref name=goalie1/&gt;

The NHL no longer permits the use of 0 or 00 as the League's database cannot list players with such numbers,&lt;ref name=goalie1/&gt; and in 2000 the League retired the number 99 for all member teams in honor of [[Wayne Gretzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perfect setting: Gretzky's number retired before All-Star Game |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated.

==Auto racing==

In most auto racing leagues, cars are assigned numbers.  The configuration of stock cars, however, makes the numbers much more prominent. (Aerodynamic [[open wheel racing|open-wheel]] cars don't have nearly the amount of flat surface that a [[stock car]] has.)  Numbers are often synonymous with the drivers that carry them.  [[Dale Earnhardt|Dale Earnhardt, Sr.]] is associated with the number 3 (although that number is actually associated more with its owner, [[Richard Childress]], who has taken the number out of reserve for his grandson [[Austin Dillon]], first in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], then in the [[Xfinity Series|Nationwide Series]], and finally in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] beginning in [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014]]), while [[Richard Petty]] is associated with Number 43, Wood Brothers Racing with Number 21, and [[Jeff Gordon]] to the Number 24.

===NASCAR===
[[File:Jeff Burton, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Jeff Burton]]'s car wearing n° 31 (2013).]]

In [[NASCAR]], numbers are assigned to ''owners'' and not specific ''drivers''. Drivers that spend a long time on a single race team often keep their numbers as long as they drive for the same owners. When drivers change teams, however, they take a new number that is owned by that team. [[Jeff Burton]], for example, raced for three teams from 1994 to 2013, and had four numbers in that time. In 1994 and 1995 he raced the Number 8 car, then owned by the Stavola Brothers. From 1996 to mid-2004 he raced for [[Roush Racing]], and drove the Number 99 car. After leaving Roush Racing for [[Richard Childress Racing]], he changed to car Number 30 (for the rest of the 2004 season) and drove Number 31 (also an RCR car) from 2005 to 2013. The Number 99 car he used to drive for Roush was driven by [[Carl Edwards]] from 2004 to 2014. When [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], having raced under Number 8 at Cup-level moved from DEI to [[Hendrick Motorsports]] he attempted to take the number with him. When that failed Hendrick was able to secure the Number 88 from [[Robert Yates Racing]].

===Formula One===
[[File:Tyrell Scheckter P34.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jody Scheckter]] running with n° 3 in 1976.]]

[[Formula One]] car numbers started to be permanently allocated for the whole season in 1974. Prior to this numbers were allocated on a race-by-race basis by individual organisers. From 1974 to the mid-1990s, the numbers 1 and 2 would be allocated to the reigning world champion and his teammate, swapping with the previous year's champions. Once numbers had been allocated, teams retained the same numbers from year to year, only exchanging for 1 and 2 when the drivers' World Championship was won. As a result, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] are infamous for having carried 27 and 28 for many years (every season from 1980 to 1989, and then again from 1991 to 1995), these numbers having originally been allocated to new entrant [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1977 and passed to Ferrari when [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] replaced [[Jody Scheckter]] as World Champion after the 1980 season. Numbers were reallocated occasionally as teams departed and joined the series, but this scheme persisted until the late 1990s; one team, Tyrrell, kept the same numbers (3 and 4) throughout this period for every season from 1974 to 1995.

The system was changed again in 1996. From that point through 2013, numbers were assigned annually, first to the reigning World Champion driver (who received number 1) and then his team-mate (who received number 2); after that the numbers were assigned to [[List of Formula One constructors|constructors]] sequentially according to their position in the previous season's [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], so that numbers were allocated (if the reigning champion is not driving for the reigning constructor's champion team) from 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and so on ([[Triskaidekaphobia|skipping 13]] with the seventh-placed team using 14 and 15). The only stipulation was that the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Champion]] was entitled to the number 1 car regardless of the constructor's results; this was relevant when the winning driver's team failed to win the Constructors Championship, or if the winning driver changed teams after winning the championship—for example, when [[Damon Hill]] moved to the [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] team for the [[1997 Formula One season|1997 season]].  This situation happened again in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]] when 2006 champion [[Fernando Alonso]] left Renault to join McLaren, earning him and his rookie teammate, [[Lewis Hamilton]], the numbers 1 and 2; and again in 2010 when [[Jenson Button]] moved to McLaren from [[Brawn GP]].

[[File:Jules Bianchi 2014 Singapore FP2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jules Bianchi]]'s #17 has not been re-issued after he died in 2015 from an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.]]
If a driver wins the World Championship but does not defend his title the following season, tradition dictates that the racing number 1 is not allocated; the reigning World Champion constructor then receives numbers 0 and 2. [[Damon Hill]] received car number 0 in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] due to [[Nigel Mansell]]'s move to [[Champcars|the CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] in the U.S., and again in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]], this time due to [[Alain Prost]]'s retirement. This tradition has not always been in place; [[Ronnie Peterson]] received number 1 in the [[1974 Formula One season|1974]]; although he did not win the championship the [[1973 Formula One season|previous year]], due to [[Jackie Stewart]]'s retirement, his [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] team was allowed to keep Number 1 as they had won the constructors' title.

The [[2014 Formula One season|2014 season]] was the first with a new system, in which drivers are assigned numbers for their entire careers. Under this system, similar to that used in [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]], drivers may choose any (available) number from 2 to 99, with number 1 reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion. The champion's "regular" number is placed in reserve while that driver is using number 1, preventing other drivers from using that number. Since [[Jules Bianchi]]'s fatal accident at [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]] in 2014, Formula One has not issued Bianchi's number 17 as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Parkes|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120039|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720184816/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120039|title=The FIA will retire Jules Bianchi's number 17 from Formula 1|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Media]]|date=20 July 2015|accessdate=20 July 2015|archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system is used in many European-style championships at national and international level; the champion receives number 1, and others are allocated either by a driver's placing in the previous season (third place the year before equates to race number 3) or by the team's placing in the Team/Constructor championship.  If the championship driver does not return, the championship team will be allowed to use number 1.

===IndyCar===
During the [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] era of Indy car racing, it was traditional for the defending champion to carry No. 1 during the season. This rule had one exception; at the [[Indianapolis 500]]. The previous year's Indy 500 winner traditional utilized No. 1 in the Indy 500 that particular year. The defending national champion would have to select a different car number for Indy only, unless he happened to also be the defending Indy 500 winner, sometimes swapping numbers with the other affected driver. There were typical exceptions to the rule, as some defending champions decided against using No. 1, preferring instead to maintain their identity with their favorite number.

During the [[Champ Car|CART]] era, car numbers 1–12 were assigned based on the previous season's final points standings. Number 13 was not allowed, and starting in 1991, No. 14 was formally assigned to [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises]]. The remaining numbers 15–99 were generally allocated to the rest of the teams on first-come, first-served basis. Again at Indianapolis only, the No. 1 was set aside for use by the defending Indy 500 winner, if he so choose to use it, since it was a USAC-sanctioned race.

Some teams in the top 12 chose not to utilize their assigned number, instead preferring a personal favorite number. For example, Penske has used 2 and 3 since 1994. Also, [[Newman-Haas Racing]] exchanged the #2 with [[Walker Racing]] to get the #5 after [[Nigel Mansell]] joined the team in 1993, #5 having been his long-used number in Formula One. "Unused" numbers from 1–12 reverted to the general pool, and could be used by any of the remaining teams.

In the current [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] era, No. 1 is set aside for use by the previous season's championship entry. However, the majority of champions since 1998 have ignored the tradition. Teams and/or sponsors often request to keep their normal numbers in order to maintain their team identity, similar to NASCAR, and some drivers have used their car numbers in social media accounts. The 1998 IndyCar championship team was A. J. Foyt Enterprises, which kept the traditional #14, while [[Panther Racing]] kept the #4 identified with team minority owner [[Jim Harbaugh]], who wore #4 for the majority of his NFL career (except for his year [[Carolina Panthers|in Charlotte]], where [[John Kasay]] wore that number, he wore Foyt's #14). In one case, at the [[2012 Indianapolis 500]], defending national champion [[Dario Franchitti]], who normally used #10 and had the right to #1, chose to use #50 at that race for the 50-year anniversary of sponsor [[Target Corporation|Target]], which has been car owner Chip Ganassi's sponsor since 1990.

In the [[2009 Firestone Indy 300]], British driver [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]] used number 40202, in reference to the [[phone text message]] number of a campaign to donate to [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]].

Other sports which feature players with numbered shirts, but where the number that may be worn is not relevant to the player's position and role are:

* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]
* [[Cycling]]
* [[Field hockey]]
* [[Lacrosse]]
* [[Roller derby]]
* [[Volleyball]]

In [[water polo]], players wear [[swim cap]]s bearing a number. Under [[FINA]] rules, the starting goalkeeper wears Number 1, the substitute goalkeeper wears Number 13, and remaining players wear numbers 2 though 12. In [[road bicycle racing]], numbers are assigned to [[cycling team]]s by race officials, meaning they change from race to race. Each team has numbers in the same group of ten, excluding multiples of ten, for example 11 through 19 or 21 through 29. If a race has squads of smaller than nine, each still uses numbers from the same group of ten, perhaps 31 through 36 where the next squad will have 41 through 46. Usually, but not always, the rider who wears a number ending in 1 is the squad's leader and the one who will try for a high overall placing. If the race's defending champion is in the field, he or she wears number 1.

In [[floorball]] all players are required to have number 1–99 on their jersey, but goalies are the only players who can wear number 1.

[[File:Lakers vs Nuggets 2013-01-06 (15).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] retired numbers displayed at the Staples Center in 2013.]]

Retiring the uniform number of an athlete is an honor a team bestows on a player, usually after the player has left the team, retires from the game, or has died. Once a number is retired, no future player from the team may use that number, unless the player so-honored permits it. Such an honor may also be bestowed on players who had their careers ended due to serious injury. In some cases a number can be retired to honor someone other than a player, such as a manager, owner or a fan. For example, the [[Boston Celtics]] retired the squad number 1 in honor of the team's original owner [[Walter A. Brown]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Oropolitics''' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' meaning [[mountain]] and ''politikos'' meaning [[citizen]]. In modern usage it denotes the use and abuse of [[mountaineering]] for political purposes.

==Origin of term==
The term "oropolitics" was coined by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in the early 1980s to describe the surreptitious efforts, first by [[Pakistan]] from the 1950s, and then by [[India]] from the late 1970s, to demonstrate control and ownership of the [[Siachen Glacier]] by allowing or organising mountaineering [[expeditions]] to the high peaks such as [[Saltoro Kangri]] and [[Teram Kangri]] flanking the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%2074-49%20Sircar%20Oropolitics.pdf  Joydeep Sircar, "Oropolitics: A dissertation on the political overtones of mountaineering in the East-Central Karakoram, 1975-82", Alpine Journal (1984), p. 74-79. Reprinted from Himalaya Sameeksha.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siachen War]] of 1984 was the direct outcome of these 'oropolitical' activities. Another example is the [[China|Chinese]] publication ''Raising the Five Star Flag on Mount Tomur'', an account of the successful Chinese expedition of 1977 to the [[Tien Shan]] peak better known by its Russian name as [[Pik Pobedy]] (nowadays renamed yet again by Kyrgyzstan as [[Jengish Chokusu]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151896/peak-pobeda-mnt-tomur.html SummitPost - Pik Pobeda/Tomur Feng - Climbing, Hiking &amp; Mountaineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese volume seems to imply a first ascent and completely ignores multiple Russian ascents.

==Other examples==
The strangest oropolitical events must surely be the unpublicised ascents of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Nanda Kot]] by joint Indo-US expeditions in the 1960s to plant devices to monitor Chinese [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Kohli and K. Conboy, "Spies in the Himalayas", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The media disclosure in 1978 that an Indo-American covert expedition had planted a nuclear-fuelled monitoring device atop Nanda Kot in the 1960s, and that subsequently the device had disappeared, led to fears of radioactive contamination of the river [[Ganges]], and a political [[brouhaha]].

Recent examples of oropolitics, again from India, were the claimed ascent of '''Nyegyi Kangsang''' (7047 m) and the attempt on the nearby peak '''Kangto''' (7090 metres) by Indian teams in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Articles in ''The Himalayan Journal'', 1996, Mumbai.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are remote [[Arunachal Pradesh]] peaks difficult of access, located on or very close to the India-China border. These were as much sporting activities as visible demonstrations of de facto control of India over terrain claimed by China. It has been suggested that the actual summit of Nyegyi Kangsang was not even reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pakpotpourri.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/the-myth-of-siachien-an-extreme-case-of-oro-politics/   Jawad Raza Khan, "The Myth of Siachien :An extreme case of Oro-politics", Pakpotpourri.  On line.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simmering dispute between [[China]] and [[Bhutan]] over [[Kula Kangri]] (7554? metres), which is possibly located wholly in Chinese territory, but is claimed by Bhutan to lie on the Bhutan-China border and be the highest peak of Bhutan, has clear oropolitical overtones. A Japanese team attempting nearby [[Gangkhar Puensum]] (7570? metres) on the Bhutan-China border in 1999 from the Chinese side stopped short of the true peak due to the [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]] having prohibited ascent of the unclimbed main summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html Kangkar Punsum and Kula Kangri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311064618/http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">The '''Pan American Sports Festival''' ({{lang-es|Festival Deportivo Panamericano}}) is a [[multi-sport event]] organized by the [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO) for athletes from [[the Americas]]. The event is held in co-ordination with ACODEPA (Asociación de Confederaciones Deportivas Panamericanas) and the Pan American elements of the [[Olympic movement]].&lt;ref name=ACODEPA&gt;[http://www.acodepa.org/en/noticias/detalle/pan-american-sports-festival-2014  PAN AMERICAN SPORTS FESTIVAL 2014]. ACODEPA (2014-04-18). Retrieved on 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of the games is to serve as a development and training event to aid countries with their preparations for the larger [[Pan American Games]] competition, which follows one year after the festival. The festival's developmental aspect is also tied in with the subsequent [[Summer Olympics]], which takes place a year after the Pan American Games. The first edition in 2014 included 24 [[Olympic sports]] within its program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://festivaldeportivo.com/introduccion/  Introducción] {{es icon}}. Festival Deportivo. Retrieved on 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; For some of the sports, the event serves as a method of qualification for competing at the Pan American Games.&lt;ref name=ACODEPA/&gt;

The idea for the festival came from [[Mario Vázquez Raña]], a Mexican sports administrator and president of PASO. The event was approved in October 2013 by the PASO assembly.&lt;ref name=Rings&gt;[http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__46808/Title__First-Ever-Pan-American-Sports-Festival-Set-For-Mexico/292/Articles First Ever Pan American Sports Festival Set For Mexico]. Around The Rings (2014-04-24). Retrieved on 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the developmental aspect of the event, Raña advocated its use as a way of supporting the region's federations by passing on technical knowledge, as well as fostering close ties between countries of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;García, Miguel Ángel (2014-07-15).

Retrieved on 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional multi-sport events, the Pan American Sports Festival is not limited to a specific city or area. The emphasis on training means the most appropriate pre-existing facilities are used instead, where possible, and location alone is not a major factor in venue selection. Training camps and coaching clinics are central aspects of the festival's events. The costs of an athlete's attendance are met by the organizers to encourage participation.&lt;ref name=Rings/&gt;

The [[2014 Pan American Sports Festival]] is scheduled for July 11 to September 30 at various locations in [[Mexico]]. Roughly 3200 athletes from 41 nations are set to take part in the 24 sports available at the inaugural event.&lt;ref name=Rings/&gt; The [[slalom canoeing]] competition in [[Puebla]] on July 11 was the debut contest of the festival's history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://festivaldeportivo.com/en/inauguration-of-the-slalom-canoing-pan-american-sports-festival-in-huauchinango-puebla/ INAUGURATION OF THE SLALOM CANOEING PAN-AMERICAN SPORTS FESTIVAL IN HUAUCHINANGO, PUEBLA].

Retrieved on 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuation of the event beyond 2014 remained open-ended at the inception of the competition, with PASO preferring to assess the value of event after the conclusion of the first edition.&lt;ref name=Rings/&gt;

==Steps==
There are four steps in the exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthy.co.uk/health/exercises/exercise-2-pelvic-lifts.html|title= Excercsie 2- Pelvic Lifts|work=mentalheathy.co.uk|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:Pelvic tilt-CDC strength training for older adults.gif|thumb|Pelvic lift (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cdc.gov)]]Lie on your back with your knees bent
* Slowly raise your buttocks and pelvis off the floor as high as possible
* Hold position
* Repeat

==Benefits==

The pelvic floor is a “broad sling of muscles, ligaments and sheet-like tissues that stretch from your pubic bone at the front of your body, to the base of your spine at the back”.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a536339/your-pelvic-floor-in-pregnancy||publisher=BabyCentre |title=Your Pelvic Floor in Pregnancy|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pelvic floor is resistant to stretch and weight as it bounces back. However, after carrying weight for long periods of time, it can become stretched.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"/&gt; Additionally, weight on the pelvic floor can weaken its resistance and contribute to its loss of shape over time.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"/&gt;

Performing this exercise routinely can strengthen glutes, abs, and lower back muscles. As a result, doctors may recommend pelvic lifts to reduce lower back pain, improve posture, and improve bladder control.&lt;ref name="DrLisa417"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.doctor-recommended-stress-relief.com/Pelvic-Tilts.html |title= Pelvic Tilts for Low Back Strength and Flexibility

'''Physical education,''' also known as '''Phys Ed.''', '''PE''', '''gym''', or '''gym class''', and known in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as '''physical training''' or '''PT''',&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2459735/Physical-training-in-schools-should-be-compulsory-says-leading-head.html ''The Daily Telegraph'', 25 July 2008: "Physical training in schools should be compulsory, says leading head"] Linked 2014-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[educational course]] related of maintaining the human body through physical exercises (i.e. [[calisthenics]]) (citation needed). It is taken during primary and [[secondary education]] and encourages [[psychomotor learning]] in a [[play (activity)|play]] or movement exploration setting to promote health.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D. (1989). ''The Discipline and the Profession.'' Foundations of Canadian Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports Studies. Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like [[soccer|football]], [[badminton]], [[captain ball]], and [[basketball]] during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as [[fencing]], and [[skateboarding]] are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[marksmanship|shooting]], and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?)  

An Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/napfa-fitness-test-education-tool|title=Napfa: From fitness test to education tool|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4&amp;nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[Test (assessment)|examinations]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like badminton, [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) 

In the [[Philippines]], PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the [[Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme]] instead for fifth and sixth year.

In [[Indonesia]], students ranging from [[kindergarten]] to [[high school]] have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have [[gymnastics]]. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts [[Pencak Silat]] and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from [[junior high school]], games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.

In Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.

In 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, [[Norman Lacy]] MP on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MinisterialStatementOnNewDirectionsInPhysicalEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Physical Education |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the goal of physical education is to "develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shape America Home Page|url = http://www.shapeamerica.org|website = www.shapeamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by [[Naperville Central High School]]. In the state of [[Illinois]] this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that [[student]]s who are physically fit are more [[academics|academically]] alert and experience growth in [[brain cell]]s or enhancement in [[brain]] development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates [[cardiovascular exercise]], [[core strength]] training, cross lateral movements, and [[literacy]] and [[math]] strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance [[learning]] and improve achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancing P.E. in Illinois, http://iphionline.org/pdf/P.E._Case_Study_Naperville.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;BC curriculum package&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- Not a strong source for this information. See actual curriculum documents for more reliable information regarding what students are learning.  --&gt;

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025619/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation &lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education https://www.supportrealteachers.org/the-importance-of-quality-physical-education.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiJncBRC1ARIsAOvG-a5DFCcyvtwvTO6TWrGWTlSx7w1mmTqLbz4jFcQRk2MNf73vNIItQS8aAvUSEALw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Scotland]] has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[Sweden]] it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}


In Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.

==Trends==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Corta-Mato Escolar 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children participating in a school race]]
Physical education [[fad|trends]] have developed recently{{when|date=March 2014}} to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical [[sports]]. Introducing students to activities like [[bowling]], [[walking]]/[[hiking]], or [[frisbee]] at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. 

Some [[teacher]]s have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as [[yoga]], deep breathing and [[tai chi]]. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi for Mental Health {{!}} Psych Central News|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/05/24/tai-chi-for-mental-health/14015.html|website=Psych Central News|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lu C. (2007 {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about [[lacrosse]] in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

PE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that over the past three years{{when|date=June 2018}} obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled.&lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education. (n.d.). Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://www.veanea.org/home/1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jf;fhjk;sfdbkdfl'b.jpg|thumbnail]]

SHAPE America's National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the incorporation of [[health]] and [[nutrition]] into the physical education curriculum. The [[Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004]] required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=REYNOLDS|first=GRETCHEN|title=Phys Ed: Can Exercise Make Kids Smarter?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/phys-ed-can-exercise-make-kids-smarter/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, G {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts [[standardized testing]] test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremarche|first1=Pamela V.|last2=Robinson|first2=Ellyn M.|last3=Graham|first3=Louise B.|title=Physical Education and Its Effect on Elementary Testing Results|journal=Physical Educator|date=2007|volume=64|issue=2 |pages=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. [[Martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], teach children [[self-defense]] and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: [[aquatic sports|aquatics]], conditioning activities, [[gymnastics]], individual/dual sports, [[team sports]], rhythms, and [[dance]].

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834 |title=Physical Education – Jul 18, 1975 – NBC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1975-07-18 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. &lt;!-- This makes no sense as written. Can someone clarify?) Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have cases physical education programs have been cut.--&gt;&lt;!-- A lot of research shows the benefits of physical education however there can also be a lot of negative experiences students deal with regarding physical education.  --&gt;&lt;!-- A section detailing possible negative experiences students may face during physical education would be beneficial  --&gt;

==Technology use in physical education==

New technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder.  With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Wang, L., Myers, D., &amp; Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Educators may use technologies such as [[pedometer]]s and [[heart rate monitor]]s to make step and heart rate goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, M., Karp, G., Goc, H., &amp; Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include [[video projector]]s, [[GPS]] and games and gaming systems such as [[Kinect]], [[Wii]] Fit and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. [[GPS]] systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames{{clarify|date=October 2014}} can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/using-pedometers-to-assess-physical-activity-participation-levels |title=Using pedometers to assess physical activity participation levels |publisher=Humankinetics.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/lessonideas/pedometer/pedometerlessonndex.html |title=PEC: Pedometer Lesson Activities |publisher=Pecentral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72841">'''Politics and sports''' or '''sports diplomacy''' describes the use of sport as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations. Sports diplomacy may transcend cultural differences and bring people together.

The use of sports and politics has had both positive and negative implications over history. Sports competitions or activities have had the intention to bring about change in certain cases. Nationalistic fervour is sometimes linked to victories or losses to some sport on sports fields.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"&gt;[http://www.ipatrix.com/873/separation-of-politics-and-sports/ Can sports and politics ever be separated?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster-Joe-Louis.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States [[World War II]] recruiting poster featuring boxer [[Joe Louis]].]] --&gt;

While the [[Olympics]] is often the biggest political example of using sports for diplomatic means, [[cricket]] and [[association football]], as well as other sports in the global arena, have also been used in this regard. In the case of [[Apartheid]], sport was used to isolate [[South Africa]] and bring about a major overhaul in the country's social structure. While ethnicity and race can cause division, sports can also help blend differences.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Stephen and Douglas Hartmann. "Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World." p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, numerous athletes have sought political office, some of them unsuccessfully, on either the national level or the sub-national level.

==Association football==

{{See also|Association football and politics}}
The most infamous declaration of politics and sport was the [[Football War]] between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. Though the build-up to the war had to do with more socio-economic issues like immigration and land reform, the impetus for war was an inflammation of tensions set off by rioters during the second North American qualifying round for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. Disturbances broke out during the first game in [[Tegucigalpa]], but the second leg saw the situation get considerably worse in [[San Salvador]]. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several [[Vice Consul]]s, increased. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near-hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, twelve days after the second-leg game, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. On July 14, 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/soccer1969.htm|title=Armed Conflict Year Index|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel national football team|Israel]] was one of the founding members of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] following its own independence in 1948 (prior to that it played under the banner of "Palestine/[[Eretz Yisrael]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts-and-Stats.html|title=Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts---Stats|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1974 Asian Games]] in Iran (and a tense loss to Iran&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-afc.com/en/features-and-interviews/31318-bayati-recalls-irans-1968-afc-asian-cup-triumph Bayati recalls Iran's tense win over Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;), Kuwait and other Arab states refused to play them. Following this, they were expelled from the confederation and spent a few years trying to qualify from such continental bodies as the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] before joining [[UEFA]].&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/worldcup2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=James | last=Montague | title=Time is right for Israel to return to its Asian roots | date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] held in China made headlines due to events that took place during the final between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]], apparently due to [[China-Japan relations|historical relations]] dating back to World War II (see [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Nanjing Massacre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3541380.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chinese riot after Japan victory | date=August 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese national anthem was being played, the home fans expressed their [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] by drowning out the national anthem with their chants. The Chinese home fans also continually booed the players, visiting fans and officials as they watched Japan defeat China 3–1. After the match, some Chinese fans rioted outside the [[Beijing Worker's Stadium]].

Once again, on September 6, 2008, [[Armenia]] and Turkey faced each other in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification match in [[Yerevan]]. In an unprecedented step, Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]] was [[Armenia-Turkey relations|invited to watch]] the match, where he and his Armenia counterpart, [[Serzh Sargsyan]], sat together, albeit behind bullet-proof glass. However, the [[Turkish national anthem]] was almost drowned out by booing from 35,000 Armenian fans, showing there is still a lot of mistrust between the two countries. However, the gesture "between the presidents showed that they believed 'football diplomacy' had achieved the most important result."

In 2009, [[France national football team|France]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] met in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off, where the winner of the two-legged tie progressed through to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. After a 1–1 aggregate draw, the match went into extra time at France's National Stadium. The winning goal came from France's [[William Gallas]], but in the build-up, [[Thierry Henry]] twice handled the ball, before passing to Gallas to score. It was seen as a "[[Hand of Frog]]" goal, in reference to the similar "[[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)#.22Hand of God.22 goal|Hand of God]]" goal in the match between Argentina and England. It the became an [[international incident]] with Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] demanding a replay and the French President telling him to "stick to politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/fifa-cool-on-irish-replay-calls/story-e6frf9if-1225799989020 Political stoush erupts over Hand of Frog | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; The replay was not given.

In 2010 [[Iran-Arab relations#United Arab Emirates|relations between Iran and the UAE]] took a turn for the worse when the [[Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran]] sent a letter to the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] complaining about the misuse of the ''[[Persian Gulf]]'' name. "The move was made after the UAE misrepresented the name ''[[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Persian Gulf]]'' during a match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The Emirate television displayed various banners showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The AFC must take serious measures to deal with UAE actions of the sort", Taj added. "The UAE side must be fined for showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the live broadcast of the match."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=125379&amp;sectionid=351020101 No Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to official comments from the UAE in regards to comparing the three disputed islands of [[Greater Tunb]], the [[Lesser Tunb]] and [[Abu Musa]], held by Iran, to the [[occupation of Palestine]], calls were made for a downgrade of ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=135944&amp;language=en Al-ManarTV:: Iran Set to Limit Ties with UAE over “Occupation”‌ Claims 03/05/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This also comes after the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]], to be held in Iran, were canceled over the dispute of the ''Persian Gulf'' label.

When drawing for [[UEFA European Championship|UEFA European Championships Qualification]] a special measure is put in place where by [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] cannot be drawn together because of the [[Disputed status of Gibraltar]]. The same system is in place for [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] because of the [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations|poor relations between the two countries]]. The same measure was put in place for [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] after the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 Russo-Georgian War]] but was however lifted for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016]] tournament when the two agreed to play each other again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UEFA reveal Euro 2016 qualifying pots|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/uefa-reveal-euro-2016-qualifying-pots|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]]|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club football===
In Germany, the occasional matchup between [[FC St. Pauli]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]] is known as the "Political Derby" (German: ''Politisches Derby''). Though not a local derby, these teams' supporters represent opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum.{{which|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesligatalk.com/the-political-derby-radical-left-3-2-hard-right/323 |title=The Political Derby: Radical Left 3-2 Hard Right &amp;#124; World Soccer Talk &amp;#124; Page 323 |publisher=Bundesligatalk.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbysieg.com/hansa-rostock-und-sankt-pauli-ein-politisches-derby/ |title=Hansa Rostock und Sankt Pauli ein politisches Derby |publisher=Derbysieg |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]] is well known as a leader of a political movement called [[Corinthians Democracy]] (Portuguese: Democracia Corinthiana) and became a symbol against the military dictatorship happening at the time in the country in the 1980s. Claiming for an electoral democracy, every decision made by the club was done by voting by the squad players with the consent of the board of directors. Footballer [[Sócrates]] is considered one of the leaders of the movement,this movement is reemerging as the political party, the [[CORINTHIAN NATIONAL PARTY]] (Portuguese: Partido Nacional Corinthiano - PNC), in which its leader and President is Juan Antonio Moreno Grangeiro.

In Israel, [[Beitar Jerusalem]] are infamously known for their [[Jewish nationalism]], particularly against the first [[Arab-Israeli]] team to win the national cup, [[Bnei Sakhnin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/originals/2013/12/israel-sports-racism-soccer-beitar-jerusalem-bnei-sakhnin.html#|title=Knesset member tries to shut out Arab-Israeli soccer club - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely [[Maccabi Haifa]] is known for its cross-community support, particularly in its support by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/israelandthepalestinians.sport|title=How racism is holding back Arab footballers|author=James Montague|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the women's game, [[Hapoel Petah Tikva]] have recruited Arab players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/sports/1.587049|title=Israeli Soccer Team Breaks New Ground: Recruits Arab Women|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[Old Firm]] rivalry between Glasgow-based clubs [[Celtic F.C.]] and [[Rangers F.C.]] is politically tinged along sectarian lines with [[Roman Catholic]]s in Scotland and Ireland supporting the former and [[Protestant]], mainly [[Presbyterian]]s, supporting the latter. It is arguably elevated by the [[Northern Ireland conflict]].

[[Athletic Bilbao]] are famous for the ''[[cantera]]'' policy of signing only [[Basque people|Basque]] players. Along with fellow Basque side [[Real Sociedad]], Bilbao raised the still banned [[Ikurriña|Basque flag]] in a game shortly after the death of General [[Francisco Franco]].

In France, [[SC Bastia]] fans display various symbols of [[Corsican nationalism]] at [[Stade Armand Cesari]], like [[Dio vi Salvi Regina]] and the "Testa di Moro" on the club crest; during [[2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] held in the [[Stade de France]] 30.000 Corsicans sang chants in their own dialect, similar to Sardinian dialect. 
[[Stade Rennais]] fans of Roazhon Celtic Kop display and are inspired by [[Breton Nationalism]] : [[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]] is played before every match.

==Bandy==
Norway declined to take part in the [[1957 Bandy World Championship]] because the Soviet Union was invited, due to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] the year before. The country made a similar protest for the [[1969 Bandy World Championship]] because of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year, handing over the hosting of the 1969 event to Sweden.

Ukraine declined to take part in the [[2015 Bandy World Championship]] hosted by Russia because of the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] the year before, since Ukraine still considers Crimea as part of its territory.

==Boxing==
[[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight champion]] [[Max Schmeling]] had been lauded by the [[Nazi Party]] as a heroic symbol of German destiny and [[Aryan]] supremacy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A politically charged [[boxing]] match with [[Joe Louis]] was preceded nationalistic symbolism and imagery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Schmeling defeated Louis, for the latter's first professional defeat in 1936. [[Langston Hughes]] recalled the national reaction to Louis' defeat.
{{Centered pull quote|I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and women sitting in the curbs with their head in their hands. All across the country that night when the news came out that Joe was knocked out, people cried. – Langston Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Langston (2002). Joseph McLaren. ed. ''Autobiography: The Collected Works of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 14. University of Missouri Press. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schmeling was, however, welcomed home with a jubilant reaction. Hitler sent his wife flowers with the message: "For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart." Schmeling responded to the accolades saying: "At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Führer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Führer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colours."&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;David Margolick, "Beyond Glory."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|rematch]] was scheduled later in New York City. In the build-up to the event U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered his support: "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money would be used to build German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Dettloff, William. "The Louis-Schmeling Fights: Prelude to War."&lt;/ref&gt; Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me."&lt;ref name="bookreview"/&gt;

Decades later, [[Muhammad Ali]] took up political causes in his refusal to be [[conscription|drafted]] for the [[Vietnam War]] amid the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the presidency of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After earning the championship, Clay converted his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name that was given to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that it goes against the Qur'an's teaching.
{{Centered pull quote|I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong...no Vietcong ever called me nigger. - Muhammad Ali}}
He then became an icon of not only the civil rights struggle, but also the anti-Vietnam War movement.
However he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000 and stripped of his championship. It was not until a lawsuit in 1970 that Ali redeemed his title.
He would continue in historical boxing matches now known as [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in 1974 and [[Thrilla in Manila]] in 1975, defeating George Foreman and Joe Frazier, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/sport/muhammad_ali.html|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|work=Biography Online|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==

[[Chess]], which is a recognized sport of the [[International Olympic Committee]], has a history of being linked to political issues.  This was particularly true of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship match]] between the American [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] of the Soviet Union. The match took place during the [[Cold War]] and the pressure was mounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3669446/How-Bobby-Fischer-and-Boris-Spassky-became-pawns.html|title=How Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became pawns|date=22 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{further|Cricket Diplomacy}}

In 1969, the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] refused to allow [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to play for [[England cricket team|England]] against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] for fear of upseting the [[apartheid]] regime. D'Oliveira was a [[coloured]] born in South Africa and refused permission to play for the South African team by the government, instead he played for England. D'Oliveria was one of the more likely players to be selected following his performance against Australia in the previous year's [[The Ashes|Ashes]]. However, he was not selected; it was suspected at the time{{by whom|date=June 2012}} that this was capitulation towards the [[apartheid]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004862|title=Life|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. A Pakistani fan in [[Karachi]] ran onto the pitch to attack the Indian [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], and fans threw stones at the Indian players during the match in Karachi. In 2000 right-wing Hindus dug up the cricket pitch in New Delhi to protest against the Pakistani team's visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"/&gt;

In reference to immigrants from the Caribbean and South Asia, British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] member [[Norman Tebbit]] once a "[[cricket test]]" could adjudge a persons loyalty to England by determining whether or not they supported the England and Wales cricket team ahead of those from their own countries of origin.

In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England and suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking then to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=August 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China have also gotten in on the cricket diplomacy act. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have once again been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] have also got both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, a massive amount compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s paltry 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket ''globally''. It is said that the motive for China's generosity is because "Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America." The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket." Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Put on the back foot, a beleaguered Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Saeed Anwar]]'s daughter he took to a more [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamental Islam]] and started growing a beard. He was then said to have been the turning point in the [[Islamisation]] of the Pakistani cricket team,&lt;ref name="cricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/219991.html|title=Finding Faith|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also a reason for [[Yousuf Youhana]]'s conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/sep/17youhana.htm|title=Youhana embraces Islam|date=17 September 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a "good Muslim" (with the notable exception of [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Danish Kaneria]] (the latter being the only [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]] on the team)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=77299|title=PakPassion.net - Pakistan Cricket Forum|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as ''Bismillah ur Rehman rahim''.&lt;ref name="cricinfo"/&gt; Most famously, after the loss to [[India versus Pakistan cricket rivalry|arch-rival India]] at the 2007 [[ICC World Twenty20]] [[Shoaib Malik]] came under fire for apologising "I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent" for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering [[Irfan Pathan]], a [[Islam in India|Muslim]] was named [[Man of the Match]] for his performance in India's win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?235722|title='Indian Media Exploited Shoaib Remark'|work=outlookindia.com/|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shah Rukh Khan]] was in the stands cheering on India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pratyush.instablogs.com/entry/shoaibs-remark-shows-pakistani-cricket-team-a-victim-of-pan-islamic-influenza/ Instablogs - Mobile - Shoaib's remark shows Pakistani team a victim of pan-Islamic influenza]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statestimes.com/2010/2010/03/16/islamisation-of-pakistan-cricket%E2%80%8F/ Islamisation of Pakistan cricket]&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational [[Politics of identity|identity]], greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and socialisation needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C02%5C07%5Cstory_7-2-2010_pg3_2|title=DailyTimes - Your Right To Know|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics in the Olympics}}

Going as far back as the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], [[Adolf Hitler]] used this as a stage to promote [[Nazism and race|Aryan nationalism]] for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bachrach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachrach|first=Susan D.|title=The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936|isbn=978-0-316-07087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth. It was also believed that sport was a "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/zcb013.htm Nazification of Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Jews and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were banned from participating in sporting events.

Once again, in 1968, the global stage of the Olympics was used to show the world the plight of the [[African-American]] struggle during the [[civil rights movement]] in their home country. The famous [[Black Power]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|salute]] was performed by [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during the medal ceremony in [[Mexico City]]. [[Věra Čáslavská]], in protest to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people, but was made an outcast by the Soviet dominated government.

In 1972, some members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were killed in an attack by Palestinian [[Black September (group)|Black September]] gunmen that started at the Olympic village and eventually resulted in the deaths of 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team.

The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] led to a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] of the [[1980 Moscow Olympics]] by a numerous Western states and their allies in protest of Russian actions. In the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]] the [[Soviet Bloc]] led a [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|retaliatory boycott]] of the games in response to the American-led Moscow games boycott.

Following the [[Wrestling at the Olympics|cancellation of wrestling]] at the Olympics in the 2010s, traditional political rivals Iran, Russia and the United States joined forces to annul the measure. The U.S. hosted a publicity event in New York City with athletes from all three countries to campaign for its reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/americas/2013/05/201351643459549559.html|title=Global rivals unite to save Olympic wrestling|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table tennis==
{{Main| Ping Pong Diplomacy}}
In the 1970s an exchange of table tennis players from the United States and the People's Republic of China led to a thaw in [[Sino-American relations]] that eventually led to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[rapprochement]] with China.
It all began when the Chinese table tennis team invited their U.S. counterparts to their country on an all-expense paid trip during the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]] in Japan. ''[[Time magazine]]'' termed it: "The ping heard ‘round the world.'" On April 10, 1971, the team, and accompanying journalists, became the first U.S. sports delegation to enter and break the information blockade since 1949. Although the U.S. team was defeated by their hosts, in return to Premier [[Chou En-lai]]'s invitation to more U.S. journalists, the United States government announced that it would lift its 20-year embargo on trade with China.
A reporter for ''Time'' noted that table tennis was "an apt metaphor for the relations between Washington and Peking" and that both state motioned a willingness to adapt to the new initiative. However, it was not until July 15, that Nixon would finally be the first U.S. president to pay a visit to China. Thirty-six years later, a three-day "Ping-Ping Diplomacy" event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] during the week of June 9, 2008. The original members of the U.S. and Chinese teams from 1971 were present to participate at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/peopleevents/pande07.html|title=American Experience|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
In 2008, Israeil tennists [[Shahar Pe'er]], [[Tzipi Obziler]], [[Andy Ram]] and [[Yoni Erlich]] were supposed to feature in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments in Doha and Dubai, respectively, despite bans on Israeli passport holders from entering both countries.&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt; Peer was refused a visa to Dubai the following year following the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] with the organisers saying "We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates." The WTA chief executive [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] later reacted saying some "sanctions" would be issued on Dubai. She also faced protests following the war during a tournament in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7891164.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dubai faces censure over Peer ban | date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]] tennis tournament India's [[Rohan Bopanna]] and Pakistan's [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] reached the men's doubles finals, eliciting responses from political leaders in both countries. Supporters from both countries, including the respective United Nations ambassadors, sat in the stands together. Rashid Malik, Pakistan's [[Davis Cup]] coach, said "The success of their team so far has been a big encouragement for both countries, it will only have a peaceful and positive impact on their people." [[Manohar Singh Gill]], India's sports minister, asked "I have one question for everyone. If Bopanna and Qureshi can play together, why cannot India and Pakistan?"

The two were also involved in another campaign promoted by the Monaco-based ''Peace and Sport'' when they wore sweat shirts with slogans reading "Stop War, Start Tennis." They refer to themselves as the "Indo-Pak Express." Such a high-profile collaboration meant this was read as a "unique" partnership. Qureshi said "It just feels like us doing well on the bigger level is getting the message across throughout the world – if me and Rohan can get along so well there's no reason the Indians and Pakistanis can't get along with each other. If even two or three per cent of people say, 'If they can get along why can't we?' that's what we're trying to do. "They're all mixed together sitting in the crowd. You can't tell who is Pakistani and who is Indian. That's the beauty about sports. Before our pairing you would never see that in any sports, fighting for one cause. It's really good to be part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/20109920244518342.html|title=Indo-Pak pair in tennis diplomacy|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their finals defeat, Qureshi spoke to the crowd to "say something on behalf of all Pakistanis, [that] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." He then made a political appeal to the controversial "[[Ground Zero mosque]]" saying "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_aisamulhaq_qureshi_delivers_message_of_peace_at_us_open_after_indopak_express_su.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi delivers message of peace at U.S. Open after Indo-Pak Express suffers defeat | first=Stefan | last=Bondy | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa}}
Most famously, the sporting boycott of [[apartheid South Africa|South Africa during Apartheid]] was said to have played a crucial role in forcing South Africa to open up their society and to end a global isolation.  South Africa was excluded from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and many sports' governing bodies expelled or suspended membership of South African affiliates.  It was said that the "international boycott of apartheid sport has been a powerful means for sensitising world opinion against apartheid and in mobilising millions of people for action against that despicable system." This boycott "in some cases helped change official policies."

The South African [[Table Tennis]] Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was replaced for the latter by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]]. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in [[Stockholm]] in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.

Started in 1980, the United Nations "Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa" – a record of sports exchanges with South Africa and a list of sportsmen who have participated in sports events in South Africa – prove to be an effective instrument to discourage collaboration with apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802160811/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html |date=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706195754/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s South Africa was also expelled from most international sports bodies. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even adopted a declaration against "apartheid in sport" on June 21, 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/SPORT/SPORTRAM.htm|title=SPORTS AND THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/3/477|title=Hitting Apartheid for Six?

The country's hosting and winning of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"/&gt; The [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa also drew similar parallels and questions as to whether race could be overcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2010/06/07/freshly-ground-south-africa-0 Freshly ground South Africa | Al Jazeera Blogs]&lt;/ref&gt; this was especially true following the death of [[Eugene Terreblanche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8602347.stm | work=BBC News | title=South African Terreblanche killed | date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[NASCAR]] are generally considered by the [[media of the United States]] to fall within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] base as an "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" who were coveted in the first decades of 21st century during electoral campaigns. [[Joe Gibbs]], a NASCAR [[Joe Gibbs Racing|team owner]], spoke at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/opinion/09/26/s.e.cupp.book/index.html NASCAR.COM - Politics once again puts NASCAR fans center stage] Sept 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates.

A study of elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at [[NCAA]] football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an [[upset (sports)|upset]], that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the [[2012 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate.com]] |date=October 24, 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2010]], at least five former athletes ran on Republican tickets for political office. [[Chris Dudley]] took part in his first political race for [[Governor of Oregon]] after playing for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. He also helped persuade former [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Jon Runyan]] to run for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district against a first-term Democrat [[John Adler]]. [[Shawn Bradley]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] ran for a seat in Utah's legislature; [[Keith Fimian]], who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]], sought a House seat from Virginia; and former [[Washington Redskins]]' [[Clint Didier]] sought a Republican nomination for Senate in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-17/professional-athletes-become-republican-hopefuls-in-strategy-for-november.html | work=Bloomberg | title=NFL, NBA Provide Recruiting Ground for Republicans in November | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Runyan won his election.

&lt;!--The President also throws the ceremonial first pitch every year in baseball--&gt;Baseball players union boss [[Don Fehr]] contributed to the presidential primaries for [[George W.

Former Buffalo Bills quarterback [[Jack Kemp]] was a nine term congressman who chaired the House Republican Leadership Conference and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H. W. Bush. Kemp was the 1996 Republican candidate for Vice President. 
[[Bill Bradley]], who played basketball for the New York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing New Jersey.

Olympic gold medalist [[Carl Lewis]] planned to run for office from [[New Jersey]], though his attempt was blocked and he awaited an appeal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/carl-lewis-files-federal-lawsuit-after-official-halts-bid-for-n-j-senate.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=David | last1=Voreacos | first2=Esme E. | last2=Deprez | title=Olympian Carl Lewis Sues After New Jersey Official Halts State Senate Bid | date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[US State Department]] initiated a sports exchange programme entitled ''[[SportsUnited]]'' to encourage dialogue between children from the ages of 7–17.

Another programme encourages U.S. athletes to travel to and learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people face in other countries.

===North Korea===

====World Cup====

North Korea's relationships with the international community, especially [[South Korea]], have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the [[1966 World Cup]], North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jon. "Chollima Upset Italy." ESPNFC.com. ESPN, 19 July 2012. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Jong-il]] believed that successful athletics increases the strength of a country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"&gt;Kim, Jung Il. On Popularizing Physical Training and Sport and Developing Sporting Skills Rapidly: Talk to the Officials in the Field of Physical Training and Sport, May 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the [[2010 World Cup]]. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during [[2006 World Cup]] qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in [[Thailand]] without any fans.&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Football Violence Erupts." BBC News. BBC, 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988 Seoul Olympics====

The years leading up to, during, and after the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]] played a major role in the development of North Korea. In 1981, [[Seoul]] was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it quickly realized that South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"&gt;Armstrong, Charles K. ''Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the [[International Olympic Committee]] to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and [[Pyongyang]]. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"&gt;Radchenko, Sergey. "It's Not Enough to Win: The Seoul Olympics and the Roots of North Korea's Isolation." The International Journal of the History of Sport 29.9 (2012): 1243-262. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, North Korea's major allies were China, the [[USSR]], and [[Cuba]]. While [[Fidel Castro]] and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to participate in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"/&gt; Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the [[foreign aid]]. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.

As a result of the failed negotiations North Korea engaged in several acts of [[terrorism]]. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill fear in the international community, a South Korean commercial flight, [[Korean Air Flight 858]] was bombed killing 115 passengers on board.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation.

====World Festival of Youth and Students====

North Korea, following its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics decided to hold the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1989. Coming one year after the most successful Olympics in years, there was large pressure on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s.

====Arirang Festival====

The [[Arirang Festival]], starting in the early 2000s takes place in the [[Rungrado 1st of May Stadium]], the largest stadium in the world holding approximately 150,000 people. Participation in this event is mandatory and the performances are extravagant and impressively choreographed.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"&gt;Merkel, Udo. "The Politics of Sport and Identity in North Korea." The International Journal of the History of Sport 31.3 (2014): 376-90. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arirang Festival can be broken up into three different parts. The first is a floor show, where thousands of athletes, gymnasts and dancers demonstrate their athletic abilities. The second section uses thousands of North Koreans to create a human mosaic depicting vibrant images of North Korea and North Korean achievements. Finally, the third section is the music that links the performance.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt; Together, these elements present to the international community North Korea's best athletes through a mix of athletics and art. The Arirang Festival draws international tourists and journalists and intends to present a thriving economic nation to the world. Many of the acts in the festival focus on the theme of reunification. Children chant "how much longer do we have to be divided due to foreign forces". The 2014 and 2015 Arirang Festivals were canceled and it is unknown if it will return.

====Recent relations with South Korea====

North Korea and South Korea marched together for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], [[2004 Athens Olympics]] and [[2006 Turin Olympics]]. Plans to walk together for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] fell through when principles regarding selection of athletes could not be agreed upon. After the 2008 Beijing Olympics tensions have increased between these two nations.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

Many inter-Korean sporting events were held in the 2000s. These events were referred to as unification matches.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

====Internal use of sports politics====

The North Korean leaders understood the importance of sports not only in the international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, [[Juche]], has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"/&gt; The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, while at the same time offering opportunities to interact with the international community.

===Brazil===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

====Corinthian Democracy====

The most famous incident in Brazilian soccer and politics is [[Corinthians Democracy]]. In 1982, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], a club in [[São Paulo]], held election of the club. Unlike other club elections, the presidency of the club was considered as the “third most important position in the country, after the governorship of Sao Paulo and the presidency of the Republic.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements through televisions, radio, music etc., that added up to around 500,000 U.S. dollars were used. There were two opposing sides, “Corinthian Democracy” and “Order and Truth”, that contested for the place. “Corinthian Democracy” aimed for political liberation within the club and “Order and Truth” remained in the old system, the oligarchy. [[Sócrates]], the former soccer player, made a statement that he would stay in Corinthians if free election amendment passes. Corinthian Democracy was defeated after the free-elections campaign’s defeat and Socrates went to Florence as a result. 

====World Cup in 1970====

After Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1970, General [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici|Emílio Médici]]’s government declared a national holiday, rewarding each player with the equivalent amount of 18,500 U.S. dollars, tax-free. Medici declared “I identify this victory, achieved in the fraternity of sport, with the ascension of faith in our struggle for national development.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew.

Opinion Poll in 1970 stated that “90 percent of Brazil’s lower classes identified soccer with the nation.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy."

Instead of individual skills, teamwork and discipline were emphasized as Medici’s government made efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy.

====Protests over 2014 World Cup Spending====

In the summer of 2013 as Brazil prepared to host the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], protests about an increase in the cost of public transportation broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Young, James. "How Soccer Culture Made Its Way Into Brazils Political Crisis." Remezcla. 2016, Retrieved March 7 2018, http://remezcla.com/features/sports/soccer-brazil-political-crisis/.&lt;/ref&gt; Although started with a small cause, the protests soon expanded to discontents over government’s spending on social welfare. Protestors requested, “hospitals and schools abiding by FIFA standards.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; This request was a “reference to FIFA’s high standards of stadium quality” when the country only spends 5 percent of GDP on education in comparison. However, [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima]], former soccer player for Brazil, stated that “World Cups aren’t made with hospitals”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;, referring to a disconnect between soccer stadium and spending on social welfare. This tension led up to a spending of US$850 million on security for the World Cup, which was five times higher than the amount spent by South Africa. 

After the official matches began, political activities, such as protests, reduced until the semi-finals. Brazil, considered as a strong candidate to win the World Cup, lost to Germany [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7-1]].  As Sarah Fellay referred, huge defeat against Germany sparked “a flood of protests across the country.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Through social media and other online formats, Brazilians started to denounce the government publicly, referring to past protests. Não vai ter Copa (there will be no cup), which was a slogan to denounce government’s spending on the World Cup, started to recur on social media. As a result, President [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]]’s approval ratings fell.
 
====Corruption====

[[Brazilian Football Confederation]], the CBF, has been accused of being under the influence of corruption. U.S. Justice Department investigated CBF former presidents for their corruption. In December 2017, [[José Maria Marin]], former CBF president, was found guilty of taking US$6.5 million in bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Laughland, Oliver. “Fifa Trial: Two Ex-Soccer Officials Found Guilty on Multiple Charges of Corruption.” The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 22 Dec. 2017, Retrieved April 4 2018. www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/fifa-trial-two-ex-officials-found-guilty-on-multiple-charges-of-corruption.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo Del Nero|Marco Polo del Nero]], also a former president of CBF, is currently under provisional suspension since December 2017 by FIFA due to investigations on his bribery.&lt;ref&gt;“Provisional Suspension of Football Official Marco Polo Del Nero Extended for 45 Days by Independent Ethics Committee .” FIFA.com, 14 Mar. 2018, Retrieved 3 April 8 2018, www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2018/m=3/news=provisional-suspension-of-football-official-marco-polo-del-nero-extended-for-45-.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arena Corinthians]], where the opening match of 2014 World Cup was held, was referred in an investigation of [[Petrobras]] corruption of “money-laundering operation.” Also, in the construction of [[Arena das Dunas]] stadium in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], Brazilian investigators found “a total of US$23.4 million was used as a source of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Paraguassu, Lisandra. “Brazil Police Arrest Former Minister in World Cup Stadium Probe.” Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 6 June 2017, Retrieved April 3 2018, www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-world-cup-stadium-probe-idUSKBN18X129.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prancercise''' is a [[holistic]] fitness method based on "a springy, rhythmic way of moving forward, similar to a [[Horse gait|horse's gait]] and ideally induced by elation" created by Joanna Rohrback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Prancercise Fitness Workout by Joanna Rohrback.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Prancercise.|Screenshot from "Prancercise: A Fitness Workout"]]
Joanna Rohrback graduated from [[Florida Atlantic University]] with a bachelor's degree in Health Services in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title= Coral Springs woman gallops into spotlight with 'Prancercise' video

:One morning [...], while power walking, with ankle weights on, there must have been an exceptionally good song on my Walkman, cause as I attempted to stretch out my legs to get the maximum muscle tone in my buttocks, hips and thighs, I somehow started naturally rocking and twisting my whole body. As I proceeded, my arms started following the rest of my body, in rhythm. The next thing I knew, I was nearly dancing, but not quite.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Rohrback, ''Prancercise: The Art of Physical and Spiritual Excellence'', (2012), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year she created the first video to feature the routine entitled “Funky Punky’s Prancercise Program.”&lt;ref name="thehairpin.com"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanna quit her job and decided to focus on her new discovery. She practiced it every day, “taking years to hone its every gesture and kick.”&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach.com"/&gt; Rohrback coined Prancercise as a means to vividly illustrate her comprehensive [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[Physical fitness|fitness]] program, modeling it after the “strength and beauty of a [[horse]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, 1994 started a near-decade of personal setbacks for Joanna Rohrback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| year=2013
| url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2013/sep/23/prancercise-a-celebration-of-self-expression/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a book about Prancercise but couldn’t find a publisher. Her mother then began to experience complications from [[Parkinson's disease]] – so Joanna became her live-in [[caregiver]]. In 2004, after her mother died, Joanna also began to suffer from severe health complications. She was unable to Prancercise for almost nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3257">'''Proposition 48''' is LIT regulation that stipulates minimum [[high school]] [[Grade (education)|grades]] and [[standardized test]] scores that [[Student athlete|student-athletes]] must meet in order to participate in college athletic competition.

The NCAA enacted Proposition 48 in 1986.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfProp48"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastweb.com/student-life/articles/347-ncaa-s-clearinghouse-rules-who-s-looking-out-for-the-student-athlete|title = NCAA's Clearinghouse Rules - Who's Looking Out for the Student-Athlete?| author = Richard Pound| date = 21 April 2009 | accessdate = 1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the regulation is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before a high school student can be eligible to play [[Division I sports]], he or she must meet academic requirements in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Seamless Eligibility Model|url=http://www.jsutigers.com/pdf9/2577007.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=29000|work=Tiger Patrol Compliance Newsletter|publisher=Jackson State University|accessdate=7 February 2014|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those standards include:

* The successful completion of 16 core courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Deborah|title=NCAA Considers New Standards for Initial and Continuing Eligibility|url=http://www4.aacrao.org/semsource/sem/indexe992.html?fa=view&amp;id=2349|work=Strategic Enrollment Management|publisher=American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A sliding-scale combination of grades in high school core courses and standardized-test scores. For example, if a student-athlete earns a 3.0 grade-point average in core courses, that individual must score at least 620 on the [[SAT]] or a sumscore of 52 on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]. As the [[GPA]] increases, the required test score decreases, and vice versa.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New Regulations==
Beginning August 1, 2016, NCAA Division I will require 10 core courses to be completed prior to the seventh semester (seven of the 10 must be a combination of English, math or natural or [[physical science]] that meet the [[distribution requirements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divisions I and II Initial-Eligibility Requirements|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/eligigfdghdhضضصنننشششbility_center/Quick_Reference_Sheet.pdf|work=NCAA ELIGIBILITY CENTER QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These 10 courses become "locked in" at the start of the seventh semester and cannot be retaken for grade improvement.

Beginning August 1, 2016, it will be possible for a Division I college-bound student-athlete to still receive athletics aid and the ability to practice with the team if he or she fails to meet the 10 course requirement, but would not be able to compete.

The '''serpentine system''' is a method employed in the organization of a [[competition]] to define the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] teams and arrange them in pools. The ''n'' ranked teams that will be involved in the [[tournament]] are distributed in ''m'' pools according to the following [[algorithm]]:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="{ font-size:smaller; }"
|- bgcolor="#efefef" 
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!! . . . !!Pool ''m'' − 1!!Pool ''m''
|- align="center"
|1||2|| . . . ||''m'' − 1||''m''
|- align="center"
|2''m''||2''m'' − 1|| . . . ||''m'' + 2||''m'' + 1
|- align="center"
|2''m'' + 1||2''m'' + 2|| . . . ||3''m'' − 1||3''m''
|- align="center"
|...||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;
|}

For instance, 12 teams would be organized in four-team pools, according to the serpentine   system, as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:smaller"
|- bgcolor="#efefef"
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!!Pool 3
|- align="center"
|1||2||3
|- align="center"
|6||5||4
|- align="center"
|7||8||9
|- align="center"
|12||11||10
|}

To improve competitivity, this method is sometimes used in conjunction with the [[Drawing straws|drawing of lots]] method: the serpentine system is used only for some of the teams involved in a competition ("seeds"); the rest is distributed in pools following a drawing of lots.

'''Serve and volley''' is a style of play in [[tennis]] where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a [[serve (tennis)|serve]]. The server then attempts to hit a [[volley (tennis)|volley]] (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), as opposed to the baseline style, where the server stays back following the serve and attempts to hit a [[groundstroke]] (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). The serve and volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on groundstrokes and [[passing shot]]s. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on the serve and volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of the serve and volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The aim of this strategy is to put immediate pressure on the opponent with the intent of ending points quickly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patcash.co.uk/2018/03/the-6-basic-strokes-in-tennis-explained/|title=Tennis 101: The 6 Basic Strokes Explained Step-by-Step {{!}} Pat Cash Tennis|date=2018-03-01|work=Pat Cash Tennis|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Good returns must be made, or else the server can gain the advantage. This tactic is especially useful on fast [[Tennis court|courts]] (e.g. grass courts) and less so on slow courts (e.g. clay courts). For it to be successful, the player must either have a good serve to expose an opponent's poor return or be exceptionally quick and confident in movement around the net to produce an effective returning volley. [[Ken Rosewall]], for instance, had a very feeble serve but was a very successful serve-and-volley player for two decades. [[Goran Ivanišević]], on the other hand, had success employing the serve-and-volley strategy with great serves and average volleys.

==The Serve and volley era==
Serve-and-volley is thought to have been invented by the Australian [[Norman Brookes]]. Although earlier tennis greats such as [[Bill Tilden]], [[Ellsworth Vines]], and [[Don Budge]] had been noted for their fine serves and net games, they had not played a 100% serve-and-volley style game. [[Jack Kramer]] in the late 1940s was the first world-class player to consistently come to the net after every serve, including his second serve. Kramer writes, however, in his 1979 autobiography, that it was [[Bobby Riggs]], his opponent in the 1948 Pro tennis tour who began the strategy: "When we first started touring he came at me on his first serve, on his second serve, and on my second serve.... my second serve didn't kick like Bobby's, so he could return that deep enough and follow into the net.... It forced me to think attack constantly. I would rush in and try to pound his weakest point -- his backhand. So the style I am famous for was not consciously planned: it was created out of the necessity of dealing with Bobby Riggs."

In the mid-1950s, when [[Pancho Gonzales]] was dominating professional tennis with his serve-and-volley game, occasional brief attempts were made to partially negate the power of his serve. This, it was felt, would lead to longer rallies and more spectator interest. At least three times the rules were modified:

* In several important tournaments such as the [[United States Professional Championship]]s the Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System (VASSS), devised by [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]], was used. The match was scored as if in [[table tennis]], with 21 points per game, 5 serves per player, and no second serves. The fans preferred the traditional scoring system, however, and in any case Gonzales continued to win under VASSS rules.
* Jack Kramer, by then the professional tour promoter and no longer its dominant player, also tried a three-bounce rule, in which the server could not come to the net until the ball had been in play for at least three bounces. Gonzales won anyway, and this experiment was dropped.
* Kramer also tried marking a secondary service line one yard behind the baseline, so that the server was further away from the net when he served. Once again Gonzales was undeterred and the original rules were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Jack|title=The Game|date=1981|publisher=André Deutsch|location=London|isbn=0233973079|page=244|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other male tennis players known for their serve-and-volley technique include [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Pat Cash]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Patrick Rafter]], [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Tim Henman]]. Sampras, despite being known for his great serve and volley game, did not always come to the net behind the serve on slower courts, particularly on the second serve. This was especially the case when he was younger.

The serve-and-volley strategy has traditionally been less common amongst female players. An early pioneer in women's volleying was [[Elizabeth Ryan]], who was at the top of the women's game in the mid-to-late 1920s. But it was later on that serve and volley caught on in women's game. The style propelled [[Margaret Court]] to become the all-time leader in Grand Slam titles (24 in singles, 62 total). [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Jana Novotná]] later became players well known for their serve-and-volley style. More recently, players such as [[Martina Hingis]], [[Justine Henin]], and [[Amélie Mauresmo]] were willing to come to the net, with Henin and Mauresmo playing a very heavy serve and volley style and volleying in general match during the 2006 Wimbledon Finals. Later in her career Henin was also known for serving and volleying on set and match points, such as on Championship point at the 2007 US Open Final against [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

==Serve and volley today==
Although the strategy has become less common in both the men's and women's game, a few players still prefer to come in on their serves. It is also commonly used as a surprise tactic. Notable examples are [[Roger Federer]], [[Feliciano López]], [[Nicolas Mahut]], [[Rajeev Ram]], [[Gilles Müller]], [[Radek Štěpánek]], [[Ivo Karlović]], [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]], [[Pierre-Hugues Herbert]], [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]], [[Sam Groth]], [[Łukasz Kubot]], [[Leander Paes]], and [[Mischa Zverev]]. The frequent use of serve-and-volley strategy enabled Zverev to upset 3-time Grand Slam champion [[Andy Murray]] at the [[2017 Australian Open]].

On the women's side, serve-and-volley has become almost extinct at the very top level. [[Roberta Vinci]] and [[Hsieh Su-wei]] are the only notable (WTA elite) players that prefer to play with this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian Renaissance: Errani/Vinci US Open Champs|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/match_reports/2012-09-09/201209091347217789115.html|publisher=USOpen.org|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the serve and volley==
[[Bill Tilden]], the dominant player of the 1920s and one of the fathers of the ''cannonball'' serve, nevertheless preferred to play from the backcourt and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and groundstrokes at him and who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. Tilden may also have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} His book ''Match Play and the Spin of the Ball'' (1925) is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In it, Tilden states that a perfect baseline player will always beat a perfect serve-and-volleyer 6-0 because his returns of service will be winning passing shots; however he also states that of course neither such a player can exist. Tilden used this style of play for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Some of the most interesting matches of all time according to Pat Cash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Tennis-In-Mens-singles-whose-rivalry-has-been-most-interesting/answer/Pat-Cash|title=Pat Cash's answer to Tennis: In Men's singles whose rivalry has been most interesting? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pitted great baseliners such as [[Björn Borg]] or [[Andre Agassi]] against great serve-and-volleyers such as [[Stefan Edberg]], [[John McEnroe]] or [[Pat Rafter]]. Since Tilden's time, head-to-head results on various surfaces, such as those played out in the famous rivalry between [[Borg–McEnroe rivalry|Borg and McEnroe]], contradict his theory that great baseline players will tend to defeat great serve-and-volley ones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/wins-mcenroe,0,3091040.photo&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective on the serve-and-volley game is that it is less tiring than playing constantly from the backcourt. Kramer says in his autobiography that he and [[Pancho Segura]] once tried playing three matches in which they allowed the ball to bounce three times before either could approach the net. "I don't believe I could have played tennis the way Segoo and I did for the three nights because it wore me out, running down all those groundstrokes. It was much more gruelling than putting a lot into a serve and following it in." He goes on to say that "[[Ken Rosewall|Rosewall]] was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net.  Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I guarantee you that Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley."

Despite the improvements in racquet technology made towards the end of the twentieth century which made serve-and-volley a rarer tool in a tennis player's skill set, players familiar with the strategy still advocate it. [[Roger Federer]] advocated up-and-coming players not to ignore the tactic's strategy of coming to the net, especially on faster surfaces and as a surprise tactic &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/07/17/roger-federer-questions-people-dont-play-like/&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other players, such as [[Mischa Zverev]], acknowledged the difficulty of mastering serve-and-volley, recalling his 36-month effort to adopt the style. As he put it: "Every point, you have to be ready. You're either going to get passed, you're going to miss an easy volley or you're going to win the point," and likened it to the [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] nature of flipping a coin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/20971090/it-take-more-roger-federer-embrace-serve-volley-tennis-make-comeback&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Shuai Shou Gong''' ({{zh|t=甩手功|s=甩手功|p=Shuǎishǒu gōng|l=Swinging hand workout}})
is a hand-swinging exercise pioneered by [[Taiwan]] [[Qigong]] (气功）[[cmn:李鳳山|master Li Feng-shan  ('''李鳳山'''）]]

Standing with both legs apart at a width roughly equal to that of the shoulder, Shuai Shou Gong involves moving both arms in parallel, swinging first to the front of the body until they are the same height as the shoulder, then swinging the arms back with a little effort until both arms are behind the body. On every fifth swing, the knee should slightly bend down and spring back quickly - once when the arms are swinging towards the back of body and another on the return swing to the front of body.

This exercise should be carried out 3 times a day and last at least 10 minutes each time. It will help to improve the blood circulation and starts the healing process if there are any ailments. It is recommended to avoid drinking cold water immediately after the exercise.

Shuai Shou Gong is claimed to cure many ailments including cancer, with anecdotal cases reported in Taiwan. However, there is a lack of peer reviewed evidence supporting these claims, which likely arose due to the [[placebo]] effect.

[[Image:1896 Olympic medal.jpg|frame|right|The [[1896 Olympics|1896 Olympic]] Silver Medal]]

A '''silver medal''' in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a [[medal]] made of, or [[silver plating|plated with]], [[silver]] awarded to the second-place finisher, or [[runner-up]], of contests or competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], etc. The outright winner receives a [[gold medal]] and the third place a [[bronze medal]]. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.

Some governments award military and civilian decorations called Silver Medals. Silver medals can also be awarded by private organizations for achievements in their fields.

== Sports ==
=== Olympic Games ===
{{main|Olympic medal}}
In [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], winners' medals were in fact [[silver]]. The custom of [[gold]]-silver-[[bronze]] for the first three places dates from the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 games]] and has been copied for many other sporting events. [[Mint (coin)|Minting]] the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]–[[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]–[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a [[Roman amphitheatre]] for what was originally a Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004]] Games. [[Winter Olympics]] medals have been of more varied design.

=== The Open Championship ===
In [[The Open Championship]] golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award presented to the lowest scoring [[amateurism|amateur]] player at the tournament.

=== Psychological ===
Silver medalists were known to suffer "self-recrimination and gold medal envy", particularly those who had lost championship games or missed out of the title by a close score, whereas bronze medalists were usually happy just to make the podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/fivering_circus/2014/02 silver_medal_face_the_saddest_looking_second_place_finishers_in_olympic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In many sports with an elimination tournament, including those with a [[third place playoff]] (such as Olympic ice hockey, Olympic soccer, [[FIFA World Cup]]), silver is the only medal given to a team that loses, whereas gold and bronze are earned by teams winning their final matches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable athletes such as [[Lothar Matthäus]] ([[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]]) and [[Jocelyne Larocque]] (2018 Olympics) removed their runners-up/silver medals right after receiving them; Larocque was later ordered by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] official to put her silver medal back on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/rules-trump-emotion-as-canadian-womens-hockey-player-ordered-to-wear-silver-medal/article38062105/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5170424 canadian-takes-off-medal-olympics/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sportswear''' or '''activewear''' is [[clothing#Sport and activity|clothing]], including [[footwear#Shoes|footwear]], worn for [[sport]] or [[physical exercise]]. Or it can be a crop top.

Sport-specific clothing is worn for most sports and physical  exercise, for practical, comfort or safety reasons.

Typical sport-specific garments include [[tracksuit]]s, [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s and [[polo shirt]]s. Specialized garments include [[swimsuit#Competitive swimwear|swimsuits]] (for [[human swimming|swimming]]), [[wet suit]]s (for [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[ski suit]]s (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Sports footwear include [[athletic shoe|trainers]], [[football boot]]s, [[riding boot]]s, and [[ice skate]]s. Sportswear also includes [[bikini]] and some [[crop tops]] and
[[undergarments]], such as the [[jockstrap]] and [[sports bra]]. Sportswear is also at times worn as [[casual attire|casual]] [[fashion]] clothing.

For most sports the athletes wear a combination of different items of clothing, e.g. [[sport shoe]]s, [[trousers|pants]] and [[shirt]]s. In some sports, protective gear may need to be worn, such as [[helmet]]s or [[American football]] body armour.

Sports fabrics are technical materials which help to keep the wearer comfortable during exercise. The type of fabric required will depend upon the intensity of the exercise and the activity. [[Yoga pants|Yoga clothing]] should use fabrics with good stretch ability for easy movement which will likely require the fabric to be of a knitted construction. Apparel for long distance running will keep the wearer in good comfort if it has excellent moisture wicking properties to enable sweat to transfer from the inside to the outside for the garment. Performance clothing for outdoor sports in the winter or snow sports ought to use breathable fabrics with very good insulating properties.

==Functional considerations==
[[File:Messi FC BARCELONA - ARSENAL 8 MAR 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Male football players of opposite teams wearing different colour outfits, while the referee is in white T-shirt.]]

Sportswear is typically designed to be lightweight so as not to encumber the wearer. The best athletic wear for some forms of exercise, for example [[cycling]], should not create drag or be too bulky.

On the other hand, sportswear should be loose enough so as not to restrict movement. Some sports have specific style requirements, for example the [[keikogi]] used in [[karate]]. Various physically dangerous sports require protective gear, e.g. for fencing, American football, or ice hockey.

Standardized sportswear may also function as a uniform. In team sports the opposing sides are usually identified by the colors of their clothing, while individual team members can be recognized by a back number on a shirt.

In some sports, specific items of clothing are worn to differentiate roles within a team. For example, in [[volleyball]], the [[volleyball#libero|libero]] (a specialist in defensive play) wears a different colour to that of their teammates. In sports such as [[soccer]] and [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] codes, a contrasting colour or pattern is worn by the goalkeeper. In other sports, clothing may indicate the current status or past achievements of a participant. In cycling disciplines, the [[rainbow jersey]] indicates the current world champion, and in major road cycling races, [[cycling jersey|jersey]]s of particular colours are worn by the race leader and leaders of auxiliary classifications.

[[Spandex]] is the preferred material for [[form-fitting]] sportswear, such as used in wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics, [[speed skating]], and [[Human swimming|swimming]].

Sportswear is commonly used as a means for the promotion of sponsors of a sportsperson or team. In some sports, there are regulations limiting the size or design of sponsorship brand names and logos on items of clothing.

==Thermal properties==
Sportswear design must consider the [[thermal insulation]] needs of the wearer. In hot situations, sportswear should allow the wearer to stay cool; while in cold situations, sportswear should help the wearer to stay warm.

Sportswear should also be able to transfer sweat away from the skin, using, for example, moisture transferring fabric. [[Spandex]] is a popular material used as base layers to soak up sweat. For example, in activities such as [[skiing]] and [[mountain climbing]] this is achieved by using layering: moisture transferring (wicking) materials are worn next to the skin, followed by an insulating layer, and then wind and water resistant shell garments.

==Moisture-wicking fabrics==
[[File:MoistureTransferringFabric.jpg|thumb|left|Moisture transferring fabric]]
Moisture-wicking fabrics are a class of hi-tech fabrics that provide moisture control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration away from the body to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.

==Golf attire==
Golf has a long tradition of specialized attire—attire that reflects the tradition of Scottish aristocrats taking in fresh air while walking around the golf course, swinging their golf clubs, and exercising in a refined, genteel sort of way.  Golf attire though, is also being influenced by modern fabrics and trends that stress function and durability.  Golfers, like athletes in other sports, are athletes first, and public figures second.  Athletes in all sports are showing a preference for moisture-wicking fabrics, crisp details, and modern fashionable colors.

==Sales trends for activewear==
[[File:Keeping Fit and Connected (6635665267) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A woman wearing [[sports bra]] and [[boyshorts]], which were conventionally women's sportswear but are now also worn as [[Casual attire|casuals]] or [[athleisure]] by women in the West.]]

As activewear becomes more fashionable and more popular with consumers, sales have increased.  Total U.S. sales of men's and women's activewear rose by 3.2% in the 12 months ending in March 2011 compared with the previous period, to $48.6 billion, according to consumer tracking firm NPD Group Inc.&lt;ref name=crainsnewyork1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasquarelli|first=Adrianne|title=Activewear makes it onto the runway|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110710/SUB/307109990|work=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of 2011, activewear sales increased 6.7% from 2010, compared with women's apparel gains in 2011 of 3.1%, also according to NPD Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2012-10-15/business/34479799_1_lululemon-athletica-sales-associates-chicago-marathon |title=Activewear sales up - South Bend Tribune |publisher=Articles.southbendtribune.com |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts attribute the growth in sales to an intrinsic change in the way activewear is designed.  “Historically, what had been available to women were items based on a men's item that were just made smaller and turned a flattering color like pink,” said Scott Key, senior vice president and general manager of Athleta. “Women athletes expected more.” 
&lt;ref name="crainsnewyork1"/&gt;  Designers have recognized this "crossover" between exercise and fashion as a major opportunity for growth. It also syncs nicely with the overall trend in American fashion towards a more casual style of dress. The trend has been so popular that it has spawned a new category of casual clothing, [[athleisure]].  [[Rebecca Minkoff]] is one of the fashion designers who has an entire collection designed around the athleisure concept.

== Protective wear ==

Sportswear also includes the variety of protective gear required for contact sports such as lacrosse, boxing and ice hockey. Different types of protective equipment are needed depending on the type of sport and position. The types of gears include the following: head gear, gum shields, shin pads, shoulder pads, and joint supports.

=== Head gear ===
[[File:Tendulkar batting against Australia, October 2010 (1), cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sachin Tendulkar]] wears traditional [[cricket whites]], together with [[pads]] to protect his legs. Both he and the short leg fielder wear [[cricket helmet]]s for protection.]]

Head gear is required for most sports with high risk of head injuries such as [[American football]], [[Bobsleigh|bobsledding]] and [[cycling]]. Injuries related to the head have the potential to cause serious damage to the spine and may be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="nsmi2"&gt;Protective wear during sport - sports injury prevention. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from Sports Medicine Information, http://www.nsmi.org.uk/articles/injury-prevention/protective-wear.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although sports like rugby and boxing do not require participants to wear head protection, trainers or referees may choose to depending on the player’s history of head related injuries.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Certain positions of some sports may require different type of protections. For example, goaltenders for ice hockey wear different types of face masks compared to other positions.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Helmets: How they work and what standards do. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from http://www.helmets.org/general.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They also have thick gloves with arm pads and shin guards to protect them from the high impact of pucks. In baseball, catchers and batters wear head gear for protection against the high velocity pitches. Head gear of different kinds must meet the standards of protection set by various organizations. [[Helmet]]s for American football must be regulated by the National Football League or the National Collegiate Athletics Association. Although new rules of safe play have been in effect, players are still in danger of brain damage due to repeated blows to the head.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Football players are more likely to develop brain related disorders during or after their careers compared to other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/health/study-focuses-on-repeated-hits-not-concussions.html|title=Study Focuses on Repeated Hits, Not Concussions|last=Carey|first=Benedict|date=2016-03-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eye and face shields ===
Sports of all types may require eye or face protection depending on the players’ need. Face masks come in different forms for different types of sports. In lacrosse and American football, the masks are metal rods attached to the helmet to cover the face.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; While optional, face masks that might be seen in basketball or rugby are plastic masks that are usually molded to fit the players’ face.&lt;ref&gt;Protective eyewear for young athletes - 2013 (2013). American Academy of Ophthalmology. Retrieved from http://www.aao.org/clinical-statement/protective-eyewear-young-athletes--november-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Such masks are worn to minimize additional damage to an already injured part of the face.

Eye protection is an additional support provided by sports goggles. Goggles may be worn in lieu of glasses or contacts. Goggles are reliable in the fact that they do not move around while the player is in motion and they protect the eye from foreign objects.&lt;ref&gt;Sports and your eyes. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from National Eye Institute, https://nei.nih.gov/sports&lt;/ref&gt; For swimmers and divers, goggles keep the water away from their eyes, thus improving visibility.

=== Mouth guards ===
Mouth guards are used in many sports including but not limited to: [[rugby football|rugby]], lacrosse, boxing, water polo, ice hockey, American football, basketball, field hockey, and various martial arts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Mouth guards reduce the risk of sport related dental injuries. Contact or some team sports have a risk of causing injuries related with the mouth, [[jaw]], teeth and oral soft [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Wearing mouth guards are not required in any sports but the players are recommended to.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Mouthguards. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from American Dental Association, http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/mouthguards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Snow gear and ski apparel ==
[[File:Vonn-lindsey 15-12-07 - 007.jpg|thumb|left|Professional USA ski racer [[Lindsey Vonn]] dressed for a race.]]
Different types of attire are needed for extreme weather conditions like snow. Thicker coats or jackets, gloves and boots are necessities in the cold. Winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing require the riders and skiers to be properly geared in the snow. Snow jackets differ from casual coats such that they may be packed with extra insulation and thicker coating materials.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; The insulation is usually made with down, which is the layer of fine feathers from geese or ducks.&lt;ref name="berry2"&gt;Berry, G. (2011, December 28). A guide to insulated winter jackets that are not made with down. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from One Green Planet, http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/a-guide-to-insulated-winter-jackets-that-are-not-made-with-down/&lt;/ref&gt; These feathers are naturally insulated to keep the birds warm in the harsh winter weathers. The feathers trap air inside and keep the body heat from flowing out.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; Down is also considered to be the highest quality of insulation for jackets. It is light and compressible. Alternative types of insulation are being invented including: synthetic microfibers and polyester-based insulation.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; These materials perform as well as down if not better and are becoming popular in the markets with the help of major brands using such materials for their equipment.

Winter gear must also be flexible so that it may offer a wide range of movement. An ideal jacket would have enough insulation to be warm but light, it should be made with material that are not restricting.&lt;ref name="porter2"&gt;Porter, J. (2016). How to choose the best ski jacket. Retrieved March 31, 2016, from http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ski-Jacket-Reviews/Buying-Advice&lt;/ref&gt; Jackets with down will be light and warm but they tend to be more expensive. Also down jackets usually are not water-resistant. Synthetic insulated jackets, however, are water-resistant and cheaper than down but lose their insulating factors and are heavier.&lt;ref name="porter2" /&gt;

In the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], the variety of equipment used contain materials such as aluminum, fiberglass, mineral-based fibers and specialty steel alloys. Skis and snowboards are made up of carbon-fiber, aluminum, titanium and boron-fiber with tungsten alloys. Boots are made with ceramic fibers and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Olympics 2014: Let the Science Begin!

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Title&amp;nbsp;IX''' is a federal civil rights law in the United States of America that was passed as part of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]]. This is Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688. It was co-authored and introduced by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] in the U.S. Senate, and Congresswoman [[Patsy_Mink|Patsy Mink]] in the House. It was later renamed the '''Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act''' following Mink's death in 2002. The following is the original text as written and signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1972:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681|title=20 U.S. Code § 1681 - Sex|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018225857/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681|archivedate=2017-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

===Foundations and hearings===
Title IX was enacted as a follow-up to passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The 1964 Act was passed to end discrimination in various fields based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of employment and public accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;Section 703(a)(1), Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (July 2, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|title=The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020043707/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|archivedate=2017-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1964 Act did not prohibit sex discrimination against persons employed at educational institutions. A parallel law, Title VI, had also been enacted in 1964 to prohibit discrimination in federally funded private and public entities. It covered race, color, and national origin but excluded sex. Feminists during the early 1970s lobbied Congress to add sex as a protected class category. Title IX was enacted to fill this gap and prohibit discrimination in all federally funded education programs. Congressman John Tower then proposed an amendment to Title IX that would have exempted athletics departments from the scope of Title IX's coverage. 

The Tower amendment was rejected, but it led to widespread misunderstanding of Title IX as a sports-equity law, rather than an anti-discrimination, civil rights law.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh. ''A Place on the Team.'' Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Title&amp;nbsp;IX is best known for its impact on high school and [[college athletics|collegiate athletics]], the original statute made no explicit mention of sports. The United States Supreme Court also issued decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, making clear that sexual harassment and assault is a form of sex discrimination. In 2011, President Barack Obama issued guidance reminding schools of their obligation to redress sexual assaults as civil rights matters under Title IX. Obama also issued guidance clarifying Title IX protections for LGBT students through [[Dear colleague letter (United States)|Dear Colleague]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Harassment and Bullying|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=October 26, 2010|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 6, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=May 13, 2016|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017204448/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|title=Sessions memo reversing gender identity civil rights policy|last=Times)|first=Charles Savage (The New York|website=www.documentcloud.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020033440/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|archivedate=2017-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/transgender-civil-rights-act-justice-department-sessions.html|title=In Shift, Justice Dept.

The precursor to Title IX was an executive order, issued in 1967 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], forbidding discrimination in federal contracts. Before these orders were issued, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) had persuaded him through successful lobbying, or influencing, his personal aides or Members of Congress to include the addition of women.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; [[Executive Order 11375]] required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=60553|title=Lyndon B.

[http://www2.edc.org/WomensEquity/pdffiles/t9digest.pdf "Title&amp;nbsp;IX: A Brief History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921141808/http://www2.edc.org/WomensEquity/pdffiles/t9digest.pdf |date=2015-09-21 }} Women's Equity Resource Center. August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; She utilized university statistics to show how female employment at the University had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; Sandler then brought her complaints to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]'s [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance]], where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint; later citing inequalities in pay, rank, and admissions, among others. 

Sandler soon began to file complaints against the University of Maryland and against other colleges while working with NOW and the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL). Sandler later filed two hundred and sixty-nine (269) complaints against colleges and universities, which led to the events of 1970.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; In 1970, Sandler joined U.S. House Representative [[Edith Green]]'s [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education]] of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor Committee]], and observed corresponding congressional hearings relating to women's issues on employment and equal opportunity. In these hearings, Green and Sandler initially proposed the idea of Title&amp;nbsp;IX. An early legislative draft was then authored by Representative [[Patsy Mink]] with the assistance of Representative [[Edith Green]].&lt;ref name="aauw"&gt;[http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm "Title&amp;nbsp;IX: A Brief History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415133530/http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm |date=2010-04-15 }} AAUW. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the hearing, there were mentions of athletics. The idea behind the draft was a progressive one in somewhat instituting an affirmative action for women in all aspects of American education.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt;

===Steps from a draft to legislative act to public law===
[[File:Birch bayh.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana]]
Mink's initial draft of Title IX was formally introduced in Congress by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana in 1971 who then was its chief Senate sponsor with respect to congressional debate. At the time, Bayh was working on numerous constitutional issues related to women's employment and sex discrimination—including but not limited to the revised draft of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The ERA attempted to build "a powerful constitutional base from which to move forward in abolishing discriminatory differential treatment based on sex".&lt;ref name="Bayh"&gt;Cruikshank, Kate. ''[http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 The Art of Leadership; A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228194809/http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 |date=2012-12-28 }}''. (Indiana University Libraries, 2007), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; As he was having partisan difficulty in later getting the ERA Amendment out of committee, the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] was on the Senate Floor for re-authorization; and on 28 February 1972, Bayh re-introduced a provision found in the original/revised ERA bill as an amendment which would become Title IX.&lt;ref name="SenateIntro"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5802-3 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks on the Senate Floor, Bayh stated, "we are all familiar with the stereotype [that] women [are] pretty things who go to college to find a husband, [and who] go on to [[graduate school]] because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again. 

The desire of many schools not to waste a 'man's place' on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts absolutely contradict these myths about the 'weaker sex' and it is time to change our operating assumptions."&lt;ref name="SenateSpeech"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5804 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; He continued: "While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work".&lt;ref name="SenateSpeech2"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5808 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Title&amp;nbsp;IX became public law on 23 June 1972.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;[http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html "Legislative History of Title&amp;nbsp;IX"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624070911/http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html |date=2010-06-24 }} National Organization for Women.

===Implementation===
[[File:BirchWorkout.jpg|thumb|Senator Bayh exercises with female athletes at Purdue University, ca. 1970s.]]Title IX's statutory language is brief. U.S. President Nixon therefore directed the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) to carry publish regulations clarifying the law's application.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; In 1974, U.S. Senator [[John Tower]] introduced the Tower Amendment which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance.&lt;ref name="cases"&gt;[http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html "Landmark Title&amp;nbsp;IX Cases in History"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110914080142/http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html |date=2011-09-14 }} Gender Equity in Sport. February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Congress rejected the Tower Amendment and passed an amendment proposed by U.S. Senator [[Jacob Javits]] directly HEW to include "reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports" adopted in its place.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations detailing how Title&amp;nbsp;IX would be enforced.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt;  These regulations were codified in the [[Federal Register]] in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Volume 34, Part 106 ([https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite-34cfr106.html {{USCFR|34|106}}] [[Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations|34 C.F.R.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/106 106] [[Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations|34 C.F.R.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/106 106]). Since 1975, the federal government has issued guidance clarifying how it interprets and enforces those regulations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/sex.html|title=Reading Room: Sex Discrimination Policy|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 6, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further legislation===
[[File:Patsymink.jpg|thumb|Representative [[Patsy Mink]] of Hawaii, Title IX co-author, for whom the law was renamed in 2002]]
The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 is tied to Title IX which was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 ruling ''[[Grove City College v. Bell]].''&lt;ref name="oyez"&gt;[http://oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1983/1983_82_792 "The Oyez Project, Grove City College v.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 19 Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This case was initially reached by the Supreme Court when [[Grove City College]] disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title&amp;nbsp;IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt; The Department of Education's stance was that because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was thus receiving federal assistance and Title&amp;nbsp;IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program that only this program had to be in compliance. This ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX as it then made many athletic programs outside the purview of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, and thus reduced its scope.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt;  

Grove City's victory, however, was short-lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act successfully passed in 1988, which extended Title&amp;nbsp;IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives ''any'' federal assistance, both direct and indirect.&lt;ref name="now" /&gt; In 1994, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, sponsored by Congresswoman [[Cardiss Collins]] required that federally-assisted educational institutions disclose information on roster sizes for men's and women's athletic teams; as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches' salaries, and other expenses, annually.&lt;ref name="cases" /&gt; In October 2002, less than a month after the death of U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution to rename Title IX the "Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act," which President George W. Bush signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush signs resolution honoring Patsy Mink|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=31 October 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018064617/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2006, Title&amp;nbsp;IX regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level; this was largely to introduce federal abstinence-only programs, which may have been a partial basis for the support of President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |title=Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |number=206 |date=October 25, 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620084108/http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |archivedate=June 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on American Schools ==

=== Equity in athletics ===
Though views differ as respects the impact of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title&amp;nbsp;IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females, and whether and to what extent Title&amp;nbsp;IX has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males.{{By whom|date=July 2017}} In addition, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of female sports led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW.&lt;ref name="Hult 240"&gt;{{harvnb|Hult |p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of Title&amp;nbsp;IX's current interpretation cite increases in female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX Athletic Statistics |publisher=[[American Association of University Women]] |url=http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016045122/http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX at 35: Beyond the Headlines |publisher=National Coalition of Women and Girls in Education |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919181353/http://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.titleix.info/ |title=TitleIX.info |accessdate=2009-10-13 |publisher=The MARGARET Fund of NWLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621091142/http://www.titleix.info/ |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, completed in 2006, pointed to a large increase in the number of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level.

The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team; (2) Volleyball, 95.7%; (3) Soccer, 92.0%; (4) Cross Country; 90.8%, and (5) Softball; 89.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/2008%20Summary%20Final.pdf |title=Women in Intercollegiate Sport, a Longitudinal National Study |year=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704090411/http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/2008%20Summary%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many contend that the current interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX by the OCR has resulted in the dismantling of men's programs, despite strong participation in those sports.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title&amp;nbsp;IX "Compliance" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports  |work=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform |first=Donald E. |last=Shelton |year=2001 |volume=34 |number=1 |ssrn=1163230}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, though interest in the sport of wrestling has consistently increased at the high school level since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USA Wrestling response to quotes by Donna Lopiano - Women's Sports Found. |year=2000 |url=http://www.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=2523 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710041414/http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=2523 |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; scores of colleges have dropped their wrestling programs during that same period.&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX has hurt the college sport, but it is now fighting back. |year=2003 |url=http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/title-ix-fall-college-wrestling.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113131238/http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/title-ix-fall-college-wrestling.htm |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrestling programs threatened by Title&amp;nbsp;IX. |year=1997 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1997/03/03-28-97tdc/03-28-97d03-017.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030105092313/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1997/03/03-28-97tdc/03-28-97d03-017.htm |archivedate=2003-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR's three-prong test for compliance with Title&amp;nbsp;IX often is cited as the reason for these cuts.&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bucknell to drop wrestling for Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance. |year=2001 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2001-05-02-bucknell-title9.htm.htm }} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling historically was the most frequently dropped sport,&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; but other men's sports later overtook the lead, such that according to the NCAA, the most-dropped men's sports between 1987 and 2002 were as follows:  Cross country (183), indoor track (180), golf (178), tennis (171), rowing (132), outdoor track (126), swimming (125) and wrestling (121).&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"/&gt;

Some believe that the increase in athletic opportunity for girls in high school has come at the expense of boys' athletics. For example, the College Sports Council has stated, "Nationwide, there are currently 1.3&amp;nbsp;million more boys participating in high school sports than girls. Using a [[gender]] quota to enforce Title&amp;nbsp;IX in high school sports would put those young athletes at risk of losing their opportunity to play."&lt;ref name="McErlain"&gt;McErlain, Eric.

There have been different interpretations regarding Title&amp;nbsp;IX's application to high school athletics.  The American Sports Council sued the Department of Education in 2011 seeking a declaratory judgment that its policy interpreting Title&amp;nbsp;IX's requirement for equity in participation opportunities is limited to colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Frommer"&gt;Frederick J. Frommer. [http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=14125030 "Group Sues Over Title&amp;nbsp;IX High School Enforcement."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124071600/http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=14125030 |date=2013-01-24 }}, Associated Press, 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Sports Council argued that "The three-part test and its encouragement of quotas, has no relevance to high schools or high-school sports, and no federal regulation or interpretation has ever said that high schools must abide by the three-part test".&lt;ref name="McErlain" /&gt; On the other hand, the Department of Education insists that Title&amp;nbsp;IX is a "valuable tool" for ensuring a level playing field for all students" and "plays a critical role in ensuring a fundamental level of fairness in America's schools and universities".&lt;ref name="Frommer" /&gt;

Between 1981 and 1999 university athletic departments cut 171 men's [[wrestling]] teams, 84 men's [[tennis]] teams, 56 men's [[gymnastics]] teams, 27 men's [[track and field|track]] teams, and 25 men's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alison.

Because teams vary widely in size, it is more appropriate to compare the number of total participation opportunities. Additionally, the total number of college participation opportunities has increased for both sexes in the Title&amp;nbsp;IX era, though solely for women when increased enrollment is accounted for, as men's participation remained static relative to university enrollment, and men's opportunities outnumber women's by a wide margin.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;GAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Sports Foundation reported in a 2007 study of athletic opportunities at NCAA institutions that over 150,000 female athletic opportunities would need to be added in order to reach participation levels proportional to the female undergraduate population.&lt;ref&gt;Cheslock, John.

===Sexual harassment and sexual violence===
Title IX applies to all educational programs and all aspects of a school's educational system. In the 1990s, the U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions clarifying that Title IX requires schools to respond appropriately to reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence against students.  Civil rights activists and organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) likewise maintain that "when students suffer sexual assault and harassment, they are deprived of equal and free access to an education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools |title=Title IX and Sexual Violence in Schools |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502072043/http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, according to an April 2011 letter issued by the [[Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]], "The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students' right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.html |title=Dear Colleague letter |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary, the Department of Education |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509212653/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.html |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, named the Dear Colleague Letter, states that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education "to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104_pg2.html |title=Dear Colleague letter |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary, the Department of Education |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423205929/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104_pg2.html |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter illustrates multiple examples of Title IX requirements as they relate to sexual violence, and makes clear that, should an institution fail to fulfill its responsibilities under Title IX, the [[Department of Education]] can impose a fine and potentially deny further institutional access to federal funds.

On March 15, 2011, [[Yale]] undergraduate student and alleged sexual violence survivor Alexandra Brodsky filed a Title IX complaint along with fifteen fellow students alleging Yale "has a sexually hostile environment and has failed to adequately respond to sexual harassment concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Christofferson |title=Yale Under Federal Investigation For 'Sexually Hostile Environment' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/yale-title-ix_n_843570.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825191009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/yale-title-ix_n_843570.html |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Amherst College]] student, [[Angie Epifano]], wrote an explicit, personal account of her alleged sexual assault and the ensuing "appalling treatment" she received when coming forward to seek support from the College's administration.&lt;ref name="Epifano"&gt;{{cite news|last=Epifano|first=Angie|title=An Account of Sexual Assault at Amherst College|url=http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2012/10/17/account-sexual-assault-amherst-college|accessdate=June 23, 2013|newspaper=The Amherst Student|date=2012-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121019215229/http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article%2F2012%2F10%2F17%2Faccount-sexual-assault-amherst-college|archivedate=October 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative, Epifano alleged that she was raped by a fellow Amherst student and described how her life was affected by the experience; she stated that the perpetrator harassed her at the only dining hall, that her academic performance was negatively affected, and that, when she sought support, the administration coerced her into taking the blame for her experience and ultimately institutionalized her and pressured her to drop out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richard|first=Perez-Pena|title=Student's Account Has Rape in Spotlight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/education/amherst-account-of-rape-brings-tension-to-forefront.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 26, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104144332/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/education/amherst-account-of-rape-brings-tension-to-forefront.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that such a prestigious institution could have such a noxious interior fills me with intense remorse mixed with sour distaste. I am sickened by the Administration's attempts to cover up survivors' stories, cook their books to discount rapes, pretend that withdrawals never occur, quell attempts at change, and sweep sexual assaults under a rug. When politicians cover up affairs or scandals the masses often rise up in angry protestations and call for a more transparent government. What is the difference between a government and the Amherst College campus? Why can't we know what is really happening on campus? Why should we be quiet about sexual assault?"&lt;ref name="Epifano"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the Amherst case reached national attention, [[Annie E. Clark]] and [[Andrea Pino]], two women who were allegedly sexually assaulted at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] connected with Amherst student, [[Dana Bolger]], and Brodsky to address the parallel concerns of hostility at their institution, filing Title IX and [[Clery Act]] complaints against the university on January 2013, both leading to investigations by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|title=Students Initiate Inquiry Into Harassment Reports|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/education/students-initiate-inquiry-into-harassment-reports.html?hpw|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527115019/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/education/students-initiate-inquiry-into-harassment-reports.html?hpw|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the national prominence of the UNC Chapel Hill case, organizers Pino and Clark went on to coordinate with students at other schools; in 2013, complaints citing violations of Title IX were filed by [[Occidental College]] (on April 18), [[Swarthmore College]] and [[the University of Southern California]] (on May 22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tyler Kingkade |title=College Sexual Assault Survivors Form Underground Network To Reform Campus Policies |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/college-sexual-assault-survivors_n_2918855.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508182458/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/college-sexual-assault-survivors_n_2918855.html |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castellanos"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dalina Castellanos |title=Complaints filed against USC, UC Berkeley over rape reporting |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0523-college-rape-20130523,0,106833.story |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2013-05-23 |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523150800/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0523-college-rape-20130523,0,106833.story |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These complaints, the resulting campaigns against sexual violence on college campuses, and the organizing of Bolger, Brodsky, Clark, Pino and other activists led to the formation of an informal national network of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|title=College Groups Connect to Fight Sexual Assault|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524233543/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=24 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stancill |first=Jane |title=UNC-CH women wage national campaign against sexual assault |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/06/01/2932161/unc-ch-women-wage-national-campaign.html |accessdate=24 June 2013 |newspaper=The News &amp; Observer |date=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609020944/http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/06/01/2932161/unc-ch-women-wage-national-campaign.html |archivedate=9 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolger and Brodsky also started [[Know Your IX]], an organization of student activists focused on legal education and federal and state policy change.

In addition to its use within formal complaints submitted to the [[Department of Education]], Title IX has been utilized in civil litigation. In 2006, a federal court found that there was sufficient evidence that the [[University of Colorado]] acted with "deliberate indifference" toward students Lisa Simpson and Anne Gilmore, who were sexually assaulted by student football players. The university settled the case, promising to change its policies and pay $2.5 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice-womens-rights/simpson-v-university-colorado |title=Simpson v.

Despite its claim that it bore no responsibility, the school settled the lawsuit, agreeing to revise and improve its official response to sexual misconduct and to pay the plaintiff $850,000 in damages and fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/jk-v-arizona-board-regents |title=J.K. v.

The Trump administration has made changes to guidelines that were implemented during the Obama administration. These changes shift the determination of sexual assault from "preponderance of the evidence" to a "clear and convincing" evidence standard, which is typically used for civil cases in which serious allegations are made (as opposed to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/06/20/how-have-obamas-k-12-policies-fared-under.html|title=How Have Obama's K-12 Policies Fared Under Trump?|last=Ujifusa|first=Andrew|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2017, US Secretary of Education Secretary Betsy Devos rescinded the Obama-era guidelines which had prodded colleges and universities to more aggressively investigate campus sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos-1506092354-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender students===
{{main|Gender identity under Title IX}}
Between 2010 and 2016, under the [[Obama administration]] the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance explaining that [[transgender]] students are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. It instructed public schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in academic life. A student who identifies as a transgender boy, for instance, is allowed entry to a boys-only class, and a student who identifies as a transgender girl is allowed entry to a girls-only class. This also applies to academic records if that student is over the age of eighteen at a university.&lt;ref name="Dominic Holden"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|title=Department Of Education Issues Guidelines To Protect Transgender Students In Single-Sex Classrooms|author=Dominic Holden|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=2 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121033755/https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo states in part that "[a]ll students, including transgender students, or students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender, or gender non-conforming, consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes."&lt;ref name="Dominic Holden"/&gt;

However, starting in 2017 with the [[Trump administration]], several of these policies have been rolled back. In February 2017, the Departments of Justice and Education withdrew the guidance on gender identity.&lt;ref name="guardian-23feb2017"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Smith|author2=Molly Redden|title=Trump administration rescinds Obama-era protections for transgender students|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|accessdate=February 23, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 23, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222220432/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|archivedate=February 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Department headed by [[Betsy DeVos]] announced on 12 February 2018 that Title IX did not allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|title=Education Department no longer investigating transgender bathroom complaints|first=Moriah|last=Balingit|date=12 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322084639/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person's sex as determined at birth and could not be changed, effectively limiting recognition of transgender students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender "on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?module=inline | title =‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration | first1 = Erica | last1= Green | first2=  Katie | last2=  Benner | first3 =  Robert | last3 = Pear | date = October 21, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the "#WontBeErased" hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html | title = #WontBeErased: Transgender People and Allies Mobilize Against Trump Administration Proposal | first = Sarah | last = Mervosh | date = October 22, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OCR's test for Title IX compliance==
{{main|Office for Civil Rights}}
Title&amp;nbsp;IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR's current interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title&amp;nbsp;IX's text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrestling With Title&amp;nbsp;IX |work=New York Times |first=John |last=Irving |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |date=2003-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311175231/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tilting the Playing Field:  Schools, Sports, Sex and Title&amp;nbsp;IX |first=Jessica |last=Gavora |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a "quota" in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the "proportionality" prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participating in athletics (in spite of the third prong, which focuses on any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participation). Instead it requires that the genders' athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest.  Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary. Critics say that prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest in spite of its gender-neutral language, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the "underrepresented sex", despite the fact that ED regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution "effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes". As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to take male athletic interest into consideration, critics maintain that the OCR's three-prong test actually operates to discriminate against men.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"/&gt;

Defenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders' differing athletic interest levels are merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title&amp;nbsp;IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics regardless of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that "opportunity drives interest",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smith professor speaks on Title&amp;nbsp;IX |work=The Smith College Sophian |year=2008 |url=http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207111650/http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title&amp;nbsp;IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in which athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students. Author and self-described women's rights advocate [[John Irving]] opined in a ''[[New York Times]]'' column that on this topic, women's advocates were being "purely vindictive" in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX be maintained.&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"/&gt;

On March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the underrepresented sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy: Three-Part Test – Part Three |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]] |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018094908/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |archivedate=2009-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OCR rescinds 2005 Title&amp;nbsp;IX clarification |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/ocr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416001218/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2Fncaa%2Fncaa+news%2Fncaa+news+online%2F2010%2Fassociation-wide%2Focr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights abandoned the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e‑mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance.

In February 2010, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] weighed in on the OCR's three-prong test, offering several recommendations on Title&amp;nbsp;IX policy to address what it termed "unnecessary reduction of men's athletic opportunities".&lt;ref name="USCCR 2010 report"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletics: Accommodating Interests and Abilities |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214210606/http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Commission: Title&amp;nbsp;IX interpretation unnecessarily hurts men's sports |work=USA Today |first=Erik |last=Brady |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |date=2010-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305151642/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education's regulations on interest and abilities be revised "to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex", almost always females.&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"/&gt;

==Legacy and recognition==
On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Title IX the [[National Women's Law Center]] lodged twenty-five complaints with the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/04/01/title-ixs-pyrrhic-victory/|title=Title IX's Pyrrhic Victory|author=Michael W.

There were several events praising the 40th anniversary of Title&amp;nbsp;IX in June 2012. For example, the [[White House Council on Women and Girls]] hosted a panel to discuss the life-altering nature of sports. Panelists included [[Billie Jean King]], All‑American NCAA point guard Shoni Schimmel of the University of Louisville, and [[Aimee Mullins]], the first double-amputee sprinter to compete in NCAA track and field for Georgetown University.&lt;ref name="washingtonpostix"&gt;{{cite news |last=Groer |first=Annie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/as-title-ix-turns-40-women-pay-homage/2012/06/23/gJQArEBjxV_blog.html |title=As Title&amp;nbsp;IX turns 40, women pay homage |work=The Washington Post |date=June 23, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624193728/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/as-title-ix-turns-40-women-pay-homage/2012/06/23/gJQArEBjxV_blog.html |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] wrote a pro-Title&amp;nbsp;IX [[op-ed]] published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/23/us-usa-obama-sports-gender-idUSBRE85M0I720120623 |title=Obama marks 1972 law lifting education barriers to girls |publisher=Reuters |date=June 23, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |first=Alister |last=Bull |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623193042/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/23/us-usa-obama-sports-gender-idUSBRE85M0I720120623 |archivedate=June 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Women's Sports Foundation]] honored over 40 female athletes.&lt;ref name="washingtonpostix"/&gt;

On June 21, 2012, [[espnW]] projected a digital mosaic featuring the largest-ever collection of women and girls' sports images (all of which were submitted by the athletes themselves) onto the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] tablet of the [[Newseum]] in Washington, D.C. The mosaic also included photos of espnW's Top 40 Athletes of the Past 40 Years.&lt;ref name="espnmediazoneix"&gt;{{cite web |last=Margolis |first=Rachel |url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/06/espnw-to-unveil-historic-title-ix-mosaic-in-washington-june-21/ |title=espnW To Unveil Historic Title IX Mosaic in Washington June 21 |publisher=Espnmediazone.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102013832/http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/06/espnw-to-unveil-historic-title-ix-mosaic-in-washington-june-21/ |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' produced its first "Women in Sports" issue in June 2012.&lt;ref name="espnmediazoneix"/&gt;

Also in June 2012, ESPN Classic first showed the documentary ''Sporting Chance: The Lasting Legacy of Title&amp;nbsp;IX'', narrated by [[Holly Hunter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2012-06-11/title-ix-documentary-debuts-june-23 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613043424/http://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2012-06-11/title-ix-documentary-debuts-june-23 |archivedate=2012-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingchancetitleix.com/|title=Sporting Chance - The Lasting Legacy of Title IX|website=www.SportingChanceTitleIX.com|access-date=December 18, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006182044/http://www.sportingchancetitleix.com/|archivedate=2017-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also showed the documentary ''On the Basis of Sex: The Battle for Title&amp;nbsp;IX in Sports'', and other programming related to women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/06/espntitleixprogrammingday/|title=ESPN Networks Offer Extensive Lineup of Women in Sports Programming on Title IX Anniversary Weekend  - ESPN MediaZone|date=June 2012|website=ESPNMediaZone.com|access-date=December 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108034930/http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/06/espntitleixprogrammingday/|archivedate=November 8, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}

'''Trash-talk''' is a form of insult usually found in sports events, although it is not exclusive to just sports or similarly characterized events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/trash_talk|title=trash talk - Definition of trash talk in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to intimidate the opposition, but can also be used in a [[Humour|humorous]] spirit. Trash-talk is often characterized by use of [[hyperbole]] or figurative language, such as, "Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!" [[Pun]]s and other wordplay are commonly used.

Trash-talk was commonly used by the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion [[Muhammad Ali]] in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled ''[[I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)|I Am the Greatest!]]'', a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, [[Wrestling|wrestlers]], and many other sports competitors to use trash-talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Derrick Z. |last= Jackson | url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/02/02/the_kings_of_trash_talk/ |title= The kings of trash talk| website= Boston.com| publisher= ''Boston Globe'', Globe Newspaper Company| date= February 2, 2010| accessdate= March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in amateur sports ranks, trash talking is generally frowned upon as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] (especially in youth leagues). UFC Lightweight Champion [[Conor McGregor]] is a more recent example of a prominent trash-talker, while former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Chael Sonnen]] is considered by some to be the greatest trash talker in [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/11/Sherdogs-Top-10-Trash-Talkers-86017|title=Sherdog’s Top 10: Trash Talkers - Number 1|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the practice of trying to distract opponents by verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their own terminology for verbal abuse: for example, [[cricket]] calls it [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]] and in ice hockey it is called chirping. Down Gaelic footballer Brendan Coulter has admitted to being targeted by sledging while on the field of play.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[The Wealdstone Raider]], a notorious fan hailing from Wealdstone, is known for trash-talking the opposition and opposition's fans.

==Smack talk==
{{Wiktionary|talk smack}}
'''Smack talk''' is a [[slang]] term seen in chat channels in [[chat room]], [[blog]], and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOG) conversations. The term came about in the early 1990s.  It generally refers to the use of threatening or intentionally inflammatory language. Smack talk can also be used with [[bullying]], whether that be [[face-to-face interaction]], or [[cyber-bullying]].

Smack talk is also a [[slang]] term used in [[sport]]s. It refers to inflammatory comments made by a person or team in order to insult, anger, annoy or be boisterous towards your opponents. Although it began as a term used by sports fans and athletes, it has spread to all areas of culture where competition takes place. In the [[United States of America|United States]], it is synonymous with "trash talk".

The social interaction within MMOGs has been observed to be quite active and often leads to long-term social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers'', CyberPsychology and Behavior, Volume 10, pp. 575-583, H. Cole and Griffiths, MD., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  MMOG groups, such as "teams", "guilds" or "corporations", are composed of groups of people who often initially have no other social contact or interactions with each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Study: Want to Make a Friend for Life? Play an MMORPG'', James Brightman, August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their conversations contain a subtext of discovery of language skills, social values, and intentions.  One of the first indicators of these is the use or offense taken by the usage of smack talk.  For the purpose of setting a social context or to comply with MMOG [[end user license agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/eula.html|title=Blizzard Entertainment:Blizzard Legal Documentation|website=www.worldofwarcraft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions, MMOG groups may establish bylaws, traditions, or rules (formal or informal) that either permit, discourage, or prohibit the use of smack talk in their conversations and postings.

'''VERB''' was a [[physical activity]] program of the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] of the [[United States Government]]. It included print, [[internet|online]], and [[television]] national paid advertising, running them on popular children's channels and popular children's magazines, for example. It ran from 2002 to 2006. The main goal of the VERB campaign was to increase and maintain physical activity among “tweens” (children ages 9–13). The campaign is based upon social marketing principles (produce, price, place and promotion) and culturally targets this age group. It encourages life style changes such as playing more and “trying new verbs.” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Huhman|first = Marian E.|last2 = Potter|first2 = Lance D.|last3 = Duke|first3 = Jennifer C.|last4 = Judkins|first4 = David R.|last5 = Heitzler|first5 = Carrie D.|last6 = Wong|first6 = Faye L.|title = Evaluation of a National Physical Activity Intervention for Children|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379706004077|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume = 32|issue = 1|pages = 38–43|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2006.08.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the program in 2004 found it to have an expansive reach. Among exposed children, 96% reported understanding of at least one key campaign message. Children who reported being aware of the VERB campaign engaged in 3.9 weekly sessions of free-time activity while children with no VERB awareness reported 3 sessions of physical activity. This is a 22% differences between the VERB aware and unaware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2004, an additional program called "VERB Summer Scorecard" emerged from the national VERB campaign. VERB Summer Scorecard was developed first launched by ''Fit Kentucky'' and the Lexington Fayette County Health Department (creating the Lexington Tweens Nutrition and Fitness Coalition). It has since been adapted and disseminated in 22 communities including cities in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado. VERB Summer Scorecard promotes and incentivizes physical activity opportunities by creating a “passport” (scorecard) system for children to track their physical activity. It creates “activity-friendly communities” to facilitate exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2011/sep/10_0173.htm|title = Preventing Chronic Disease: September 2011: 10_0173|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
