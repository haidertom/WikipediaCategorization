'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the [[Atlanta]] underground for the 2015 mixtape ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'' before attaining nationwide attention following the [[Metro Boomin]] collaborative album ''[[Savage Mode]]'' (2016), its lead single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]", and his collaboration with Drake, "[[Sneakin']]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview|title=21 Savage chops it up with Seth Rogen|date=2018-04-26|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved his first number one single at the end of 2017 with his feature on [[Post Malone]]'s "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]."&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/post-malone-21-savage-rockstar-no-1-billboard-hot-100-chart/|title=Post Malone's ''Rockstar'' Hits No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=XXL Magazine|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he also released the [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]] and Metro Boomin collaboration ''[[Without Warning (21 Savage, Offset and Metro Boomin album)|Without Warning]]''.

==Early life==

In the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in the [[DeKalb County School District]] due to gun possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmVcwIyKo|title=21 Savage Interview With The Breakfast Club (8-4-16)|date=August 4, 2016|people=[[Charlamagne tha God]], [[DJ Envy]]|publisher=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to begin attending schools around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] before being sent to a youth detention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-21-savage-news.22853.html|title=Everything You Need To Know About 21 Savage|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was "exhausted" by.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/04/21-savage-the-breakfast-club-interview|title=21 Savage Talks Being An "A" Student, Losing His Best Friends On The Breakfast Club|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the [[Bloods]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]].

In 2017, his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', reached at number two on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7866158/21-savage-haim-billboard-200-albums-chart-top-10|title=21 Savage &amp; Haim Debut in Top 10 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lead single, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]", charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2017/08/08/hot-100-niall-horans-slow-hands-enters-top-15-21-savages-bank-account-top-20/|title=Hot 100: Niall Horan’s "Slow Hands" Enters Top 15, 21 Savage’s "Bank Account" Top 20|date=August 7, 2017|work=Headline Planet|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was featured on [[Post Malone]]'s single "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]", which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and broke several records.&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/post-malone-rockstar-breaks-spotify-global-record/|title=Post Malone Breaks Spotify Global Record With ''Rockstar'' - XXL|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031270/post-malone-rockstar-platinum-21-savage|title=Post Malone &amp; 21 Savage's 'Rockstar' Is Now Certified Platinum|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on [[Young Thug]]'s extended play ''[[Hear No Evil (Young Thug EP)|Hear No Evil]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/13/young-thug-hear-no-evil-nicki-minaj-21-savage|title=Young Thug drops Hear No Evil EP|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=April 13, 2018|website=The Fader|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he also appeared on the single "Outstanding" by [[SahBabii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/sahbabii-21-savage-new-song-outstanding/|title=Listen to SahBabii and 21 Savage's New Song "Outstanding"|last=India|first=Lindsey|date=April 20, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 21 he was featured on the single "Rover 2.0", which is part of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s [[Simi (mixtape)|Simi]] mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1988300/blocboy-jb-rover-2-0-feat-21-savage/music/|title=BlocBoy JB – "Rover 2.0" (Feat. 21 Savage)|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 23, 2018|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/05/blocboy-jb-simi-mixtape/|title=BlocBoy JB Drops 'Simi' Mixtape Featuring Drake, Lil Pump and More|last=Coleman II|first=C. Vernon|date=May 4, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, he was featured on [[Ty Dolla Sign]]'s "Clout", which is part of the upcoming deluxe edition of last years's ''[[Beach House 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Darville|first=Jordan|date=May 9, 2018|title=Ty Dolla $ign recruits 21 Savage for "Clout"|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/05/09/ty-dolla-sign-21-savage-clout|magazine=The Fader|location=New York City|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Called "one of the last street niggas left making music" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called "Guns Down, Paintballs Up" which was intended to reduce gun violence.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title="Paintball wars," initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as "well-intentioned, however, misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide "paintball wars"|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2" /&gt;

Controversy arose after Abraham-Joseph pulled out a firearm during a pool party on June 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8460380/21-savage-gun-atlanta-brawl|title=21 Savage Draws Gun During Atlanta Pool Party Brawl|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph was given the firearm by a friend after seeing an opposing crew member also pull out a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/21-savage-pull-out-a-gun/|title=21 Savage Pulls Out A Gun During A Brawl: Watch|date=2018-06-10|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
From a broken home, Saunders grew up being looked after by his extended family. By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months.&lt;ref name="DOC" /&gt; After this he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Saunders' first success in rapping had come with a self-released record called "Dirty Foot," which he wrote while still in high school&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; and distributed in the [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] area, at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single ("Dirty Foot"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

His debut album, ''[[Death Before Dishonor (album)|Death Before Dishonor]]'', was released on June 17, 2008&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Listing at [http://www.billboard.com/artist/431860/2-pistols/chart Billboard.com], accessed October 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and featured production from the [[Grammy]]-winning [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]], Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, Bolo Da Producer, and others. Other tracks from the album included "You Know Me feat. Ray J" &amp; "Thats My Word feat.Trey Songz"," in addition to "[[She Got It]]."

==Music==

===2003-2006: Early Career===
360 made his first official appearance in 2003 on fellow Australian rapper Infallible's EP ''A Burning Ambition'', on the track "Situation Critical" along with MCs [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter]] and Versa. The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled ''Rarities'', in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend [[Pez (musician)|Pez]].

In 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called "Nutcase", which 360 described as a "fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape ''Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head'' with the song "In Da Chub", a remix of [[50 Cent]]'s 2003 hit [[In da Club|"In Da Club"]].

===2007–2012: ''What You See Is What You Get'', ''Falling &amp; Flying''===
In February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/artists/ |title=Soulmate Records Artist Profiles |publisher=Soulmate Records |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |title=360 signs with Soulmate Records |publisher=Ground Up Hip-Hop |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921181046/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |archivedate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He released his debut album, ''What You See Is What You Get'', on 22 March 2008. An ''InTheMix'' reviewer found 360 "not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album".&lt;ref name="InTheMix"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | title = 360 ''What You See Is What You Get'' Album Launch | work = InTheMix | publisher = [[Sound Alliance]] | date = 12 April 2008 | accessdate = 2 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015013/http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | archive-date = 27 September 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview for ''Peak Street Magazine'', 360 described his musical style as a combination of "some [[pop music|pop]] influences, [[electro (music)|electro]], [[dubstep]], and unintelligent rhymes".&lt;ref name=ps-video&gt;{{cite web | last=James | first=Sam | title=360 Interview with ''Peak Street'' | url=http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131061052/http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 January 2013 | work=Peak Street Magazine | accessdate=2 December 2012 | first2=Danny | last2=Haneman | first3=Aisha | last3=Glen | date=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of "Mamma Mia", which depicts his desire for [[Bec Hewitt]] and mocked her husband, [[Lleyton Hewitt]], which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/song-slams-trophy-wife-bec/story-e6frf96x-1111115315578 | title=Rapper 360 makes Bec Hewitt lustful object of lyrics | publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]] ([[News Corporation]]) |work=[[Herald Sun]] | date=14 January 2008 | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/rapper-360-targets-bec-and-lleyton-hewitt-in-myspace-video/story-e6frewyr-1111115314399 | title=Rapper 360 targets Bec and Lleyton Hewitt in MySpace video | date=14 January 2008 | publisher=[[News Limited]] ([[News Corporation]]) | work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 described it as a comedic effort, "I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as "a publicity stunt".&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

By March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with [[EMI Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/soulmate-records-x-emi-partnership// |title=Soulmate Records partners with EMI |publisher=Soulmate Records | date=15 March 2010 | accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, his single, "Just Got Started" (featuring [[Pez (musician)|Pez]]), was released.&lt;ref name="iTunes10"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/just-got-started-feat.-pez/id406702982 | title = 'Just Got Started' (feat.

360's second album, ''[[Falling &amp; Flying]]'', was released on 30 September 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/01/13/144105_entertainment.html|title=360 is flying and falling...|publisher=[[The Cairns Post]]|date=13 January 2011|last=Kuch|first=Jesse|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reached No.&amp;nbsp;4 on the ARIA Albums Chart,&lt;ref name="AusCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = Australian Charts Portal.

By October 2012, ''Falling &amp; Flying'' was certified platinum by ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units,&lt;ref name="ARIA Alb Cert 2012"&gt;{{Cite certification|region=Australia|type=album|certyear=2012| accessdate = 2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was certified double platinum by July 2014.&lt;ref name="Jam"&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Jennings|title=360: Alive and Kicking|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|website=Rolling Stone Australia|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=2 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021113403/http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|archive-date=21 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the fourth single from the album, "Boys like You" (featuring Gossling), was released, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the Australian singles chart in February 2012.&lt;ref name="AusCharts"/&gt; The track also reached the top&amp;nbsp;40 of the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="NZCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://charts.org.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = New Zealand Charts Portal.

The national Australian "Flying Tour" occurred in support of the album, and 360 was supported by new Melbourne artist Bam Bam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bam Bam|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/bam-bam|website=triple j Unearthed|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present: ''Utopia'' &amp; ''Vintage Modern''===
In June 2012, 360 revealed to national youth broadcaster [[Triple J]] that he was already working on his third album, describing the upcoming release as "quite a dark album". He described it further, "No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has "been getting a gang of beats from all different people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 readies "dark" new album|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3518538.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release ''Don't Look Down'', by Pez, ''[[Utopia (360 album)|Utopia]]'', by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=360|title=22 November 2013|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/3ree6ixty/posts/10153511253795367|website=360 on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORTHWRITE RECORDS Media Release 21 Nov 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkQ8OvXr3A|website=FORTHWRITE on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in [[Brisbane]], Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled "On A Planet No One Knows". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from [[Joss Whedon]] regarding gender equality, is "about racism in Australia."&lt;ref name="Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=WATCH: 360 – 'On A Planet No One Knows’|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/tv/watch-360-on-a-planet-no-one-knows/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is.

In February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper [[Eminem]], alongside [[Kendrick Lamar]]. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lisa Visentin|title=360 announces tour of Australia|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/360-announces-tour-of-australia-20140527-zrpdp.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the artist's third album, ''Utopia'', on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: "Impossible", "On A Planet No One Knows" and "Sixavelli". "Impossible" is a collaboration with [[Daniel Johns]], of Australian band [[Silverchair]], and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Impossible (Ft Daniel Johns) Official Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU78NDpJt08|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before [[Australia Day]].&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - ON A PLANET NO ONE KNOWS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUWJZSbGF7s|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Sixavelli" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Sixavelli (Feat.

Alongside fellow Australian hip hop act [[Hilltop Hoods]], 360 performed at the 2014 [[Splendour In The Grass]] festival, held in [[Byron Bay]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Splendour In The Grass 2014 lineup|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3990250.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian "Utopia Tour" occurred during September 2014 and 360 was supported by US rapper Hopsin, UK artist Lunar C, Pez and Miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jed Ahern|title=360 ANNOUNCES UTOPIA TOUR SUPPORT ACTS|url=http://www.vmusic.com.au/news/360-announces-utopia-tour-support-acts.aspx|website=V Music|publisher=Foxtel Management Pty Ltd|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923110500/http://www.vmusic.com.au/news/360-announces-utopia-tour-support-acts.aspx|archive-date=23 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
During the early years of his music career, 360 collaborated with Pez as part of a duo called "Forthwrite",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForthWrite - 'Guilty Conscience'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDxVFtjCxyI|website=PEZ on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a track called "The Club Song" on the 2010 album ''[[Good Gracious]]'', by producer [[M-Phazes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Gracious M-Phazes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/good-gracious/id359623656|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 also featured on Pez's 2008 single, "The Festival Song", which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;14 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart.&lt;ref name="The ARIA Report – 12 Jan 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20090120-0000/issue985.pdf | title = ARIA Report – 12th Jan 2009 | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | issue = 985 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | date = 12 January 2009 | accessdate = 2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called "Rapper Tag", on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappertag.com:80/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712043422/http://www.rappertag.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Rapper Tag |publisher=360 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating ("tagging") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3076379.htm |title=Triple J: 360 Rapper Tag Phenomenon |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.optimising.com.au/blog/interview-on-social-media-with-melbourne-rapper-360/|date=9 March 2011|author=Daniel  |title=Interview on Social Media with Melbourne Rapper 360 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian hip hop duo [[Diafrix]] collaborated with 360 for the song "I'm A Dreamer", which appears on the 2012 album ''Pocket Full Of Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diafrix feat. 360 - I'm A Dreamer (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTRCDRkz34|website=diafrix lion on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music. The album also features rappers Iron Solomon, Okwerdz and Kool G Rap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghosts in the Room Ghosts in the Room|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/ghosts-in-the-room/id537506609|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) program ''[[Q&amp;A (Australian talk show)|Q&amp;A]]''. He appeared alongside [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], a particle physicist, [[Richard Gill (conductor)|Richard Gill]], renowned conductor, and [[Nalini Joshi]], a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of "passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=gregmoskovitch|title=Get The Popcorn, 360 Is A Panelist On Next Monday's Q&amp;A|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/421594/360-will-appear-next-mondays-qa.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: "Get out of the country! This is not your country!" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian flag represents racism: 360|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndT4vq5CpE|website=ABC News (Australia) on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This response caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#BBCTrending: Has Australia's flag been co-opted by racists?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29712614|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also "got a bit offended"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence "To be honest, even I got a bit offended." from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his ''Q&amp;A'' comments and explained after the airing of the episode: "If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nastassia Baroni|title=Pez Admits To Being "Offended" By 360's 'Q&amp;A' Comments|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/pez-admits-to-being-offended-by-360s-qa-comments/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{outdated section|date=September 2016}}
At the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a [[cornea transplant]], which "left him with fuzzy vision" in that eye.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; A July 2014 feature article in ''Rolling Stone Australia'' stated that he is "legally blind in his right eye", while his left eye is "slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus".&lt;ref name="Jam" /&gt;

On 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a [[go-kart]]ing accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists [[Bliss n Eso]]. He suffered a torn [[artery]], lacerated [[pancreas]] and a damaged [[scrotum]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cameron|title=Accident brings 360 perspective|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/accident-brings-360-perspective/story-e6frfn09-1226152049520|work=news.com.au| publisher = News Limited (News Corporation) | date = 29 September 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rapper, "It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag".&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues. In mid-February 2012, he posted a video clip with the following statement: "I don't usually drop serious videos, but this is something I'm passionate about spreading awareness about.

On 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named ''I'm Sorry'' onto his [[Facebook]] page. It talked about his [[codeine]] addiction. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Macklovitch was born to Moroccan Jewish Mother and Russian Jewish father in [[Montréal, Quebec]]. When he was 18 years old, his mother took him and his brother back to Morocco to connect with their roots. His older brother, David Macklovitch, is one-half of the electro-funk duo [[Chromeo]].

A-Trak was the first DJ to win all three major DJ competition titles ([[Disco Mix Club|DMC]], ITF and [[Vestax]]), as well as being the first DJ to win five World Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-Trak Bio, Music, News &amp; Shows|url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/a-trak/|publisher=DJZ.com|accessdate=March 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329044955/http://djz.com/featured_djs/a-trak/|archive-date=March 29, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Disco Mix Club|DMC World DJ Championship]] in 1997 at the age of 15, making him the youngest and first Canadian winner of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1997 World DJ Champion – A-Trak (Canada) |url=http://www.dmcdjchamps.com/worldchamps.asp |work=[[Disco Mix Club]] |accessdate=Oct 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523075622/http://www.dmcdjchamps.com/worldchamps.asp |archivedate=May 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an honorary member of the now defunct DJ crew [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]],&lt;ref name="Rane"&gt;{{cite web |title=A-Trak |url=http://www.rane.com/dj/atrak.html |work=[[Rane Corp.]] |accessdate=Oct 1, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817040111/http://www.rane.com/dj/atrak.html|archivedate=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of The Allies alongside frequent collaborator [[DJ Craze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4idols.com DJ A-Trak Bio, Photo Gallery, and Videos |url=http://www.4idols.com/d/dj-a-trak.htm |work=4idols.com |publisher=MadCool Network LLC |accessdate=Oct 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218060705/http://www.4idols.com/d/dj-a-trak.htm |archive-date=December 18, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 90's A-Trak developed a notation system for scratching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spinscience.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=50 |title=Online Turntable Music Resource – A-trak |publisher=Spin Science |date=19 November 2004 |accessdate=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216054321/http://www.spinscience.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=50 |archive-date=February 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a lecture about it at the Skratchcon 2000 conference and published an article in ''Tablist'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/871390/invisibl-skratch-piklz-to-host-turntablist-conference/|title=Invisibl Skratch Piklz To Host Turntablist Conference|newspaper=MTV News|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbansmarts.com/interviews/audioresearch.htm|title=:: urban smarts . com {{!}} audio research artists' a-trak, dj serious, dj simahlak {{!}} interview ::|website=www.urbansmarts.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared on the cover of multiple magazines including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[URB (magazine)|URB]]'' (twice), ''[[BPM (magazine)|BPM]]'' and ''Status''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://djatrak.com/2012/02/05/cover-of-billboard-magazine/ |title=A-Trak : Fat-free since 1982! » Blog Archive » Cover of Billboard Magazine! |publisher=Djatrak.com |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424025409/http://djatrak.com/2012/02/05/cover-of-billboard-magazine/ |archive-date=April 24, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://djatrak.com/2009/05/12/cover-of-status-magazine/ |title=A-Trak : Fat-free since 1982! » Blog Archive » Cover of Status magazine |publisher=Djatrak.com |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402072533/http://djatrak.com/2009/05/12/cover-of-status-magazine/ |archivedate=April 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A-Trak and his brother Dave ran the record label Audio Research from 1997–2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandboxautomatic.com/audioresearch/ Audio Research Records] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901161548/http://www.sandboxautomatic.com/audioresearch/ |date=September 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Williamsburg, he founded the label [[Fool's Gold Records]] with Nick Catchdubs in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com/ |title=Fool'S Gold |publisher=Foolsgoldrecs.com |accessdate=2010-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511072449/http://foolsgoldrecs.com/| archivedate= May 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kanye West ===
A-Trak had been booked to play a show, in 2004 at a tiny record shop in London. [[Kanye West]] came to support [[John Legend]] who was also playing in the same show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before Leaping Onto Kanye's Records, A-Trak Forged A Career From Scratch|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/14/477850354/before-leaping-onto-kanyes-records-a-trak-forged-a-career-from-scratch|website=Npr.com|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Kanye West]] recruited A-Trak as his personal tour DJ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.joonbug.com/frequency/featured-artist-profile-atrak-frequency-new-york/xcN90nPl4f5 |title=Featured Artist Profile: A-Trak : Frequency New York |publisher=Newyork.joonbug.com |accessdate=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703062112/http://newyork.joonbug.com/frequency/featured-artist-profile-atrak-frequency-new-york/xcN90nPl4f5 |archive-date=July 3, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has worked closely with him ever since, including performances alongside the rapper at MTV specials, the [[Grammy Awards]], multiple [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and worldwide stadium shows. A-Trak also recorded scratches on Kanye West's second and third studio albums ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005) and ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007) and was an influence on the overall sound of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardfest.com/atrak.php |title=A-Trak : : HARD New Year's Eve : December 31st, 2009 |publisher=Hardfest.com |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kanye West in Portland.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Kanye West performing backed by A-Trak in [[Portland, Oregon]], 2005]]
Over the years he has endorsed several brands including Serato [[Scratch Live]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serato.com/artists/atrak |title=Artists – A-Trak |publisher=Serato.com |accessdate=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001193044/http://www.serato.com/artists/atrak |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rane Corp.|Rane DJ equipment]].&lt;ref name="Rane" /&gt;

He is known for merging the sounds of rap and electronic music through his remix work, his 2007 CD ''Dirty South Dance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=4518 |title=RA Reviews: A-Trak – Dirty South Dance (Album) |publisher=Residentadvisor.net |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; his production for [[Kid Sister]] and [[Lupe Fiasco]], and his remixes for electronic artists including [[MSTRKRFT]] and [[Boys Noize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/A-Trak |title=A-Trak Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of his production displays a separation of his electronic and hip hop identities, with releases such as "Piss Test" featuring Juicy J and collaborations with Tommy Trash on "Tuna Melt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2010/10/14/music-a-trak-feat-cyhi-da-prynce-ray-ban-vision/|title=Music: A-Trak Feat.

In 2009, A-Trak collaborated with [[Armand Van Helden]] to form a disco house production duo under the name [[Duck sauce (band)|Duck Sauce]]. They released the song "[[Anyway (Duck Sauce song)|Anyway]]" in October on [[Ministry of Sound]].

'''A1 B-boy Sasa''' is an African American street dancer credited as the first number one B-boy dancer of Hip-Hop &lt;ref&gt;Hip Hop: The Complete Archives&lt;/ref&gt; at [[DJ Kool Herc]] parties in 1973. It was Kool Herc who coined the term B-boy and B-girls for the [[African American]] teenage [[Funk]] dancers that attended his earliest parties. Sasa along with the first generation B-boys, Trixie, Wallace, Dancing Doug, The Legendary Twins, DJ Clark Kent, Chip The Mad Hatter and a few others from Kool Herc's parties, set the foundation for the B-boy dance style in Hip-Hop taking it to the floor, performing acrobatic moves.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Anthony Mark. That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader. Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis group New York 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-96918-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from the music of [[James Brown]] records and breakbeats, along with many other funk hits. The 3rd generation of dancers later introduced the B-boy dance as (Breakdancing) into the mass media, because of the popularity of Hip-Hop becoming a mainstream genre in the early 1980's.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sasa was born in Manhattan [[New York City]] and raised in the West Bronx. From childhood he grew up dancing to [[R&amp;B]], [[Soul]] and [[Funk]] music, early on he began getting recognition from his school peers for his fine dancing skills at school parties and later in his teenage years. Many of his friends began inviting him to house parties where he made a name for himself on the dance floor with his unique style, especially at Kool Herc parties where the best dancers from all over the [[Bronx]] and [[Harlem]] went to get down, and even dancers from [[Brooklyn]]. The best B-boy dancer was given the title "(A1)." Sasa, like most of the "first generation originals," stopped B-boy dancing by 1977. He retired undefeated never losing a B-boy battle. The original (1975-77) Zulu king's B-boys popularity and influence brought in the era of forming break crews also known as rockers, with the Zulu's adding "new footwork and acrobatic tricks" to the foundation of the dance, causing it to become a city-wide competitive trend amongst the youth, "which established this performing art form between the years of 1973 to 1977. After that, new generation B-boy crews began to pop up in communities all across the city."&lt;ref&gt;Universal Hip Hop Museum Editorial Director &amp; Writer Eddie Lane&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Beatrice Han-Pile in "Nietzsche and Amor Fati" (EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY) cites "for all its importance, there is very little material on amor fati in Nietzsche’s work. All in all, I was able to identify only seven passages, four in the published work, one in the Will to Power, one in the Nachlass and one in Nietzsche’s correspondence."</comment>

{{italic title}}
'''''Amor fati''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "love of fate") is a [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate".  It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] apparently means by the concept of "[[Eternal recurrence#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence]]": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

==Concept==
The concept of ''amor fati'' has been linked to [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'' Ch. VIII: "Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."—as quoted in [[Pierre Hadot]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dLVyyDE-vQC&amp;redir_esc=y The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Meditations|the writings]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' IV.23: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, O World! Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or too late for me. All that your seasons produce, O Nature, is fruit for me. It is from you that all things come: all things are within you, and all things move toward you." — as quoted in [[Hadot]] (1998), p. 143.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  who did not himself use the words (he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], not Latin).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with the Master: Robert Greene on Stoicism|url=https://dailystoic.com/robert-greene-interview/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. ''Amor fati'': let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. ''Looking away'' shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the "Yes-sayer", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality ''per se''.

Quotation from "Why I Am So Clever" in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', section 10:&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Writings of Nietzsche''. trans. and ed. by Walter Kaufmann (1967), p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is ''amor fati'': that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.  Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it&amp;mdash;all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary&amp;mdash;but ''love'' it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering.  For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked.  In section 3 of the preface of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Leiter|first=Brian|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J.

* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

'''Biological immortality''' (sometimes referred to ''bio-indefinite'' mortality) is a state in which the [[rate of mortality]] from [[senescence]] is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from [[chronological]] age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A [[Biology|biologically]] immortal [[life|living]] being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury or disease.

This definition of [[immortality]] has been challenged in the ''Handbook of the Biology of Aging'',&lt;ref name="Masoro2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.J. |last=Masoro |editor=Austad, S.N. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of the Biology of Aging |edition=Sixth |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=0-12-088387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely [[old age]]s, an idea referred to as the [[Late-life mortality deceleration|late-life mortality plateau]]. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late life: a new frontier for physiology |author1=Michael R.

The term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]] on how many times they can divide.

==Cell lines==
{{Main article|Cell culture|Immortalised cell line}}
[[Biologist]]s chose the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]], the point at which cells can no longer divide due to [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. Prior to [[Leonard Hayflick]]'s theory, [[Alexis Carrel]] hypothesized that all normal [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells were immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shay, J.

The term "immortalization" was first applied to [[cancer]] cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening [[enzyme]] [[telomerase]], and thereby avoided [[apoptosis]]—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are [[HeLa]] and [[Jurkat cells|Jurkat]], both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. HeLa cells originated from a sample of [[cervical cancer]] taken from [[Henrietta Lacks]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"&gt;{{cite book | last = Skloot | first = Rebecca | authorlink = Rebecca Skloot | title = [[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] | publisher = Crown/Random House | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4000-5217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the [[polio vaccine]],&lt;ref name="Smith_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first = Van | last = Smith | title = The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science. | url = http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | publisher = [[Baltimore City Paper]] | date = 2002-04-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160109/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | archivedate = 2004-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; sex hormone steroid research,&lt;ref&gt;Bulzomi, Pamela.

===Bacteria and some yeast===
Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] also age. However, symmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology: Volume 23, Issue 19, 7 October 2013, Pages 1844–1852 "Fission Yeast Does Not Age under Favorable Conditions, but Does So after Stress." Miguel Coelho1, 4, Aygül Dereli1, Anett Haese1, Sebastian Kühn2, Liliana Malinovska1, Morgan E. DeSantis3, James Shorter3, Simon Alberti1, Thilo Gross2, 5, Iva M. Tolić-Nørrelykke1&lt;/ref&gt; In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of [[cell division]] can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent isn't restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner [[stem cell]]s and [[gamete]]s can be regarded as "immortal".

===Hydra===
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|''Hydra'']]
[[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] are a [[genus]] of the [[Cnidaria]] phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, [[freshwater]] animals possessing [[radial symmetry]] and no post-[[mitotic]] cells. All hydra cells continually divide.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo [[senescence]], and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martínez |first=Daniel E. |year=1998 |url=http://www.biochem.uci.edu/Steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in Hydra |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=217–225 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc. |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7 |pmid=9615920 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426043703/http://www.biochem.uci.edu/steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain [[telomere]] lengths.

===Jellyfish===
''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', or ''[[Turritopsis nutricula]]'', is a small ({{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}}) species of [[jellyfish]] that uses [[transdifferentiation]] to replenish cells after [[sexual reproduction]]. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the [[Caribbean sea]], but has now spread around the world. Similar cases include hydrozoan ''Laodicea undulata''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|author = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|volume=149|pages=339–346|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scyphozoan ''[[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]]'' sp.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|access-date = 2015-12-31|volume = 10|pages = e0145314|display-authors = etal|pmc = 4687044|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109164816/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0145314|archivedate = 2016-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobsters===
{{further information|Lobster#Longevity}}
Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get (as detailed below).

Their longevity may be due to [[telomerase]], an [[enzyme]] that repairs long repetitive sections of [[DNA sequence]]s at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as [[telomeres]]. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and Its Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | pmid=12208997 | pmc=120798}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfram Klapper |author2=Karen Kühne |author3=Kumud K.

Lobsters grow by [[moulting]] which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lobsters.org/tlcbio/biology3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211101926/http://www.lobsters.org/tlcbio/biology3.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|title=Don’t Listen to the Buzz: Lobsters Aren’t Actually Immortal|first=Marina|last=Koren|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150212053821/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/?no-ist|archivedate=2015-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European lobster]] has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.

===Planarian flatworms===
[[File:Polycelis felina.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Polycelis felina'', a freshwater planarian]]
[[Planarian|Planarian flatworms]] have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus [[Schmidtea mediterranea]] suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an "apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells". "Both asexual and sexual animals display age-related decline in telomere length; however, asexual animals are able to maintain telomere lengths somatically (i.e. during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by [[amputation]]), whereas sexual animals restore telomeres by extension during sexual reproduction or during embryogenesis like other sexual species. Homeostatic telomerase activity observed in both asexual and sexual animals is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, whereas the increased activity in regenerating asexuals is sufficient to renew telomere length... "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas C. J. Tan |author2=Ruman Rahman |author3=Farah Jaber-Hijazi |author4=Daniel A. Felix |author5=Chen Chen |author6=Edward J. Louis |author7=Aziz Aboobaker |last-author-amp=yes |title=Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity are differentially regulated in asexual and sexual worms |journal=PNAS |volume=109 |issue=9 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1118885109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/22/1118885109.full.pdf+html |pages=4209–4214 |pmid=22371573 |pmc=3306686 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306010425/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/22/1118885109.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifespan: For sexually reproducing planaria: "the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells". Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: "individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years". They do not live forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|title=''Schmidtea '', model planarian|website=www.geochembio.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230230657/http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|archivedate=2010-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to engineer biological immortality in humans ==
Although the premise that biological aging can be halted or reversed by foreseeable technology remains controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Robin|title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine|journal=Biogerontology|date=April 2009|volume=10|issue=2|pages=223–228|doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10522-008-9170-6|accessdate=1 June 2013|pmid=18726707}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into developing possible therapeutic interventions is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rejuvenation Research|url=http://www.liebertpub.com/REJ|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the principal drivers of international collaboration in such research is the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a non-profit organization that advocates a number of what it claims are plausible research pathways that might lead to engineered [[negligible senescence]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reimagined Research Strategy for Aging|url=http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research|publisher=SENS Research Foundation|accessdate=1 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527212514/http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://longevityreporter.org/blog/2016/8/8/the-renaissance-of-rejuvenation-biotechnology|title=The Renaissance of Rejuvenation Biotechnology|last=Aguiar|first=Sebastian|date=|work=Longevity Reporter|access-date=2018-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063256/http://longevityreporter.org/blog/2016/8/8/the-renaissance-of-rejuvenation-biotechnology|archive-date=2018-03-05|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, Harvard scientists headed by biologist [[David Andrew Sinclair|David Sinclair]] announced they have tested a metabolic precursor that increases [[NAD+]] levels in mice and have successfully reversed the cellular aging process and can protect the DNA from future damage. "The old mouse and young mouse cells are indistinguishable", David was quoted. Human trials are to begin shortly in what the team expect is 6 months at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/harvard-scientists-pinpoint-critical-step-in-dna-repair-cellular-aging/|title=Harvard scientists pinpoint critical step in DNA repair, cellular aging|date=2017-03-23|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
To achieve the more limited goal of halting the increase in mortality rate with age, a solution must be found to the fact that any intervention to remove senescent cells that creates competition among cells will increase age-related mortality from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Paul |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Intercellular competition and the inevitability of multicellular aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=5 December 2017 |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=12982–12987 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1618854114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future medicine, life extension and  "swallowing the doctor"==

Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">In [[mathematics]], there are two competing definitions for a '''chiral polytope'''. One is that it is a [[polytope]] that is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] (or "enantiomorphic"), meaning that it does not have [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]]. By this definition, a polytope that lacks any symmetry at all would be an example of a chiral polytope. 

The other, competing definition of a chiral polytope is that it is a polytope that is as symmetric as possible without being mirror-symmetric, formalized in terms of the [[group action|action]] of the [[symmetry group]] of the polytope on its [[Flag (geometry)|flags]]. By this definition, even highly-symmetric and enantiomorphic polytopes such as the [[snub cube]] are not chiral. Much of the study of symmetric but chiral polytopes has been carried out in the framework of [[abstract polytope]]s, because of the paucity of geometric examples.

==Polytopes without mirror symmetry==

Many polytopes lack mirror symmetry, and in that sense form chiral polytopes.
The simplest example is a [[scalene triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Crystals and Crystal Structures|first=Richard J. D.|last=Tilley|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2006|isbn=9780470018217|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilVvOYOFCx8C&amp;pg=PA44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for polytopes to have a high degree of symmetry, but yet to lack mirror symmetry; an example is the [[snub cube]], which is [[vertex-transitive]] and chiral in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=H. S. M. Coxeter|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1995|isbn=9780471010036|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUm5Mwfx8rAC&amp;pg=PA282|page=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetric chiral polytopes==
===Definition===
The more technical definition of a chiral polytope is a polytope that has two orbits of [[Flag (geometry)|flags]] under its [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]], with 
adjacent flags in different orbits. This implies that it must be [[vertex-transitive]], [[edge-transitive]], and [[face-transitive]], as each vertex, edge, or face must be represented by flags in both orbits; however, it cannot be mirror-symmetric, as every mirror symmetry of the polytope would exchange some pair of adjacent flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For the purposes of this definition, the symmetry group of a polytope may be defined in either of two different ways: it can refer to the symmetries of a polytope as a geometric object (in which case the polytope is called ''geometrically chiral'') or it can refer to the symmetries of the polytope as a combinatorial structure (an [[abstract polytope]]). Chirality is meaningful for either type of symmetry but the two definitions classify different polytopes as being chiral or nonchiral.&lt;ref name="schulte04"&gt;{{citation

===In three dimensions===
In three dimensions, it is not possible for a geometrically chiral polytope  to have finitely many finite faces. For instance, the snub cube is vertex-transitive, but its flags have more than two orbits, and it is neither edge-transitive nor face-transitive, so it is not symmetric enough to meet the formal definition of chirality. The [[Quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular polyhedra]] and their duals, such as the [[cuboctahedron]] and the [[rhombic dodecahedron]], provide another interesting type of near-miss: they have two orbits of flags, but are mirror-symmetric, and not every adjacent pair of flags belongs to different orbits. However, despite the nonexistence of finite chiral three-dimensional polyhedra, there exist infinite three-dimensional chiral [[Infinite skew polyhedron|skew polyhedra]] of types {4,6}, {6,4}, and {6,6}.&lt;ref name="schulte04"/&gt;

'''''Code of the Lifemaker''''' is a 1983 novel by British [[science fiction]] [[author]] [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]].  [[NASA]]'s [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830007077.pdf Advanced Automation for Space Missions] was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] between [[Earth]] explorers and the Taloids, [[clanking replicator]]s who have [[colonization|colonized]] [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

A sequel titled ''[[The Immortality Option]]'' was published in 1995.

==Plot summary==

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement.  One of those factory ships suffers severe  radiation damage from a near-miss by a [[supernova]] and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to [[evolution|evolve]] on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.baen.com/chapters/W200203/0743435265___0.htm| title=Prologue: The Searcher| work=Code of the Lifemaker| publisher=Baen| accessdate=2006-08-01| year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=James P.| last= Hogan| title=Minds, Machines &amp; Evolution| publisher=Baen| year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the "Lifemaker".

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and [[NATO]]) dispatched the ''Orion'' with a cover story of [[terraforming]] [[Mars]] for human habitation.  Karl Zambendorf, a [[con artist]] who is present on this expedition to verify [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the ''Orion'' and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the ''Orion'' arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a [[prophet]].

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to [[slavery|slaves]]. The NASO business administrators on the ''Orion'' are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans "Lumians" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the [[Ten Commandments]] for his people to prevent a war from starting. "All Taloids are brothers" and "No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the ''Orion'' crew not working for NASO.  There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

'''Aaron Williams''' (born April 10, 1993), best known as '''DJ A-Tron''', is an American [[Disc jockey|DJ]], radio host, web personality, event producer, [[entrepreneur]] and marketing executive. He was referred to by the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' as "The Twerk King".&lt;ref name="laweekly1" &gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/11/13/a-tron-is-the-party-starting-twerk-king-of-la A-Tron Is the Party-Starting Twerk King of L.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; His business portfolio also includes a creative marketing and branding agency, management company, as well as an online Jewelry store, The Work Shop.&lt;ref name="FJ" &gt;[http://blog.fashionjunkiez.com/2013/08/08/dj-a-tron-is-really-putting-a-new-spin-on-things-not-just-on-the-turntables/ DJ A-Tron is really putting a new spin]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
When A-Tron was 7 years old, he got his first set of turntables.&lt;ref name="jenesus" &gt;[http://www.jenesismagazine.com/feature-dj-a-tron-talkin-business/ DJ A-Tron talking Business]&lt;/ref&gt; He started to try DJing a lot more after that as he got older, and became much more skilled at it. DJ A-Tron then very often DJed in clubs, house parties, and underground raves. He uses the DJ software Serato. A-Tron started creating mixes online and soon became regionally known. Starting on air at the age of 16 on his own internet radio show JerkinRadio, A-Tron split time as a teen between School and Music. After graduating from [[St. Bernard High School (Los Angeles, California)]] in 2011, A-Tron started headlining at Hollywood clubs and throwing massive underground functions.&lt;ref name="laweekly1"/&gt;

== DJ career ==

Performing, A-Tron has toured worldwide, and performed at official events for the [[GRAMMY Award]]s, and [[BET Awards]].

JerkinRadio is an internet radio station A-Tron opened in 2008 while in high school. The station grew to 100,000 monthly listeners due to endorsements from the jerkin scene's major figures.&lt;ref name="laweekly1" /&gt;

A-Tron does many celebrities kids birthday parties and tours High School around California. He also performed at SXSW in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref name="sxsw" &gt;[http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_MS27381 DJ A-Tron SXSW]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mixtape DJ &amp; producer, A-Tron has released many mixtapes during his career. In 2013, A-Tron released "Skinny Ni**as" featuring [[Nipsey Hussle]].&lt;ref name="skinny" &gt;[http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dj-a-tron-skinny-niggas-feat-nipsey-hussle-squad-5150-song.1614048.html DJ A-Tron Skinny Ni**as]&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in 2013 that A-Tron would release his debut mixtape with features from [[Nipsey Hussle]], Joe Moses, [[TeeFlii]], among others.&lt;ref name="SM" &gt;[http://www.sneakermob.com/content/sneakermob-x-dj-tron-interview  DJ A-Tron SneakerMob Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[XXL (magazine)]] called DJ A-Tron "The Most Popular underground DJ" in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="xxl" &gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/01/yg-dj-mustard/  YG &amp; Mustard new sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

Outside of his career as a DJ and personality, A-Tron is active in the entertainment business as a business entrepreneur working with [[Fox Sports]] and multi-platinum production band 1500orNothin.

In September 2013, A-Tron opened his online retail Jewelry store, The Work Shop.&lt;ref name="FJ" /&gt;

In classical [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''death drive''' ({{lang-de|Todestrieb}}) is the [[Drive theory|drive]] toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by [[Sabina Spielrein]] in her paper "Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |date=April 1994 |title=Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=155–186 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1994.00155.x}} [http://www.arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf Free pdf of the full essay] by the Arizona Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1995 |title=Destruction as Cause of Becoming |journal=Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought |volume=18 |issue= |pages=85–118|doi= |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.018.0085a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'')&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1912 |title=''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'' |journal=Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen |volume=IV |issue= |pages=465–503 |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/JahrbuchFuumlrPsychoanalytischeUndPsychopathologischeForschungenIv_509/JdP_IV_1912_1_Haelfte#page/n467/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, which was then taken up by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]].'' This concept has been translated as "opposition between the ego or death [[instinct]]s and the sexual or life instincts".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pleasure Principle'', Freud used the plural "death drives" (''Todestriebe'') much more frequently than in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;See occurrences of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drives%22 "death drives"] and of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drive%22 "death drive"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The death drive opposes [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as "[[Thanatos]]" in post-Freudian thought, complementing "Eros", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in 1909 and then by [[Paul Federn]] in the present context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Jones |title=The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.

The Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, ''Instinkt'' ("instinct") and ''Trieb'' ("drive"), often translating both as ''instinct''; for example, "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; "This equating of ''instinkt'' and ''Trieb'' has created serious misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'', (London, 1946), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988) [1973]. "[https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22Instinct+(or+Drive)+=+I.+D.:+Instinkt%22%22D.:+Trieb%22 Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7).]"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud actually refers to the term "instinkt" in explicit use elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Instinct and Drive (pp. 19ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Instinct+and+Drive%22 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=qnowAAAAIAAJ 1970] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67045-2 |id={{ISBN|1-31767045-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so while the concept of "instinct" can loosely be referred to as a "drive," any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an "instinct") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death "drive" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the "death drive", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply "drive" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis|last=|first=|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=9780393317756|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate ''Trieb'' and ''Instinkt'' as "drive" and "instinct" respectively.

==Origin of the theory: ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''==
{{Main|Beyond the Pleasure Principle}}
{{Anchors|origin}}It was a basic premise of Freud's that "the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.

The first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from [[World War I]]), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: "dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.

A second problematic area was found by Freud in children's [[Play (activity)|play]] (such as the ''Fort/Da'' [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). "How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem came from clinical practice.  Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly "obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with what he called "the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 294 and p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; such evidence led Freud "to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, "What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in "''an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its "pressure towards death", and the resulting "separation of the death instincts from the life instincts"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", pp. 316 and 322.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously "regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego"—so as to allow that "there ''might'' be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called "the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923) he would develop his argument to state that "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Ego/Id", p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he would spell out more clearly that the "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "The Economic Problem of Masochism" in ''On Metapsychology'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.

At the close of the decade, in ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), Freud acknowledged that "To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and Its Discontents", in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"{{!}}Philosophy of the "Will" in Schopenhauer}}
From a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. His philosophy, expounded in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical "will" (more clearly, a '''will to live'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Presentation |others=Translated by Richard E. Aquila and David Carus |location= New York |publisher= Longman |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's [[pessimism]] led him to believe that the affirmation of the "will" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the "will".

Freud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding "the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for our time'' (London, 1989), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ernest Jones]] (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London, 1964), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his ''New Introductory Lectures'' (1932), "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (London, 1991), pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to add that "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural application: ''Civilization and Its Discontents''==
{{Main|Civilization and Its Discontents}}
Freud applied his new theoretical construct in ''Civilization and Its Discontents'' (1930) to the difficulties inherent in [[western culture|Western civilization]]—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that "a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' pp. 310 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Why War?" in ''Civilization'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London, 1997), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud made a further connection between [[Group (sociology)|group]] life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like [[Wilfred Bion]].

==Continuing development of Freud's views==
In the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with "the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations ''outwards''".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Dickson, "Editor's Introduction", ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given "the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness", he wrote in 1930, "I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', pp. 311 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations.  A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote moreover that "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud quoted by Dickson, ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last writings, it was the contrast of "two basic instincts, ''Eros'' and ''the destructive instinct'' [...] our two primal instincts, ''Eros'' and ''destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition'' vol. xxiii (London 1964), pp. 148 and 246.&lt;/ref&gt; on which he laid stress.  Nevertheless, his belief in "the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''SE'', xxiii, pp. 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to the end.

==Analytic reception==
As Freud wryly commented in 1930, "The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' that the book not only "displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings" but was "further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Life'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that "the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London, 1946), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Hartmann]] set the tone for [[ego psychology]] when he "chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the "life" and "death instincts"'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Freud'', pp. 402-3n.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[object relations theory]], among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi, ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, "for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, ''Freud'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of "those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] and her immediate followers considered that "the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct";&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;[[Hanna Segal]], ''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London, 1964), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. "This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression".&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], for his part, castigated the "refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the ''ego'' [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his ''Fort!'' and in his ''Da!''."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 124 and 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] too would proudly proclaim that he, "besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the [[repetition compulsion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You say After You Say Hello?'' (London, 1975) pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the twenty-first century, "the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London, 2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in ''Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative''&lt;ref name=Adams01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Deracination; Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-79144834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.''&lt;ref name=Adam02&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Death's Dream Kingdom|date=2006|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-74532468-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.

[[File:Sudden Death graph.png|thumb|Illustration of the premature death trajectory. There is a sharp decline in human function in a short period of time.|205x205px]]
Dying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |title=Trajectory of Dying |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306060758/http://www.fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudden death trajectory==
Sudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and [[unnatural death|unexpectedly die]] without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like [[myocardial infarction]] or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.

==Chronic malady trajectory==
[[File:Length of Dying Process.png|thumb|A chronic malady trajectory showing an overall decline in health with intermittent rises and falls in human function.|left|187x187px]]The chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[HIV]] or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by [[Recrudescence|acute crises]] and intermittent [[Cure#Remission|recoveries]].&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil;&lt;ref name=one /&gt; the patient may eventually become [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|mentally]] and [[emotional exhaustion|emotionally exhausted]].

==Natural death trajectory==
[[File:Steady decline.png|thumb|A typical natural death trajectory chronicling a long, steady decline in health over time.]]
A natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to [[aging-associated diseases|old age]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolejs, Josef; Marešová, Petra. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268335/ "Onset of mortality increase with age and age trajectories of mortality from all diseases in the four Nordic countries"], ''[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerstorf|first1=Denis|last2=Ram|first2=Nilam|last3=Lindenberger|first3=Ulman|last4=Smith|first4=Jacqui|title=Age and time-to-death trajectories of change in indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related functions|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1805–1821|doi=10.1037/a0031340|pmid=23356526|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0024-EC54-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical care==
When someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide [[palliative care|palliative]] or comfort care.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life. Comfort care, or [[Hospice|hospice care]], is reserved for patients who acknowledge they will not be able to recover.

A considerable portion of [[transhumanists]] and [[singularitarians]] place great hope into the belief that they may become [[Immortality|immortal]] by the year 2045,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohan|first1=Peter|title=Google's Engineering Director: 32 Years To Digital Immortality|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/20/googles-engineering-director-32-years-to-digital-immortality/|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their "biological shell".

== The realism of the concept ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use [[artificial intelligence]], archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.com/?p=2717 US Government funds virtual reality research], bioethics.com, 14 June 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed [[Internet]] accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-immortality.org/whatis.html |title=What is Digital Immortality? |publisher=Digital-immortality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of [[Dmitry Itskov]]'s [[2045 Initiative]] is to "create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eördögh|first1=Fruzsina|title=Russian Billionaire Dmitry Itskov Plans on Becoming Immortal by 2045|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524041430/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Reaching digital immortality is a two-step process:
#  archiving and [[digitizing]] people,
#  making the avatar live

=== Archiving and digitizing people ===
According to [[Gordon Bell]] and [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] from [[Microsoft Research]], retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a [[terabyte]] of [[computer data storage|storage]] (for adequate quality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69927/tr-2000-101.pdf Digital Immortality], by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray, Microsoft Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=William Sims|title=Personality Capture and Emulation|date=November 2013|isbn=978-1-4471-5604-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=digital+immortality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[speech recognition|speech]] or [[optical character recognition|text recognition]] technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.

A second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.

Rothblatt envisions the creation of "mindfiles" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desat|first1=Marla|title=Would You Clone Your Mind to Live Forever?

Richard Grandmorin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/soon_immortal |title=soon immortal (@soon_immortal) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: "semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality".

Some find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.&lt;ref name="sterkul"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computertechnik und Sterbekultur|isbn=978-3-643-11071-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=caprica+digital+immortality|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuade|first1=Zan|title=What happens to us on the internet when we die?|url=https://theweek.com/articles/554466/what-happens-internet-when-die|publisher=The Week|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

Susanne Asche states:
{{pull quote|text=As a hopefully minimalistic definition then, digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person-centric repository containing a copy of everything that a person sees, hears, says, or engenders over his or her lifespan, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, movies, television shows, music albums/CDs, newspapers, documents, diaries and journals, interviews, meetings, love letters, notes, papers, art pieces, and so on, and so on; and if not everything, then at least as much as the person has and takes the time and trouble to include. The person’s personality, emotion profiles, thoughts, beliefs, and appearance are also captured and integrated into an artificially intelligent, interactive, con-versational agent/avatar. This avatar is placed in charge of (and perhaps "equated" with) the collected material in the repository so that the agent can present the illusion of having the factual memories, thoughts, and beliefs of the person him/herself.|author=Susanne Asche|source=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums, Digital Immortality &amp; Runaway Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asche|first1=Susanne|title=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums|date=23 April 2005|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|url=http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/3296701|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Making the avatar alive ===
{{unclear|date=March 2016}}

Defining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.

Rothblatt proposes the term "mindware" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's "mindfile" to generate a "mindclone." Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

=== Calibration process ===
During the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.
During this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

{{Other uses|Egoist (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
'''Egotism''' is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Kowalski ed., ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'' (1997) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;William Walker Atkinson, ''The New Psychology'' (2010 [1909]) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those "loved" or considered as "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or [[narcissism]] – indeed some would say "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Schmalhausen, ''Why We Misbehave'' (2004 [1928]) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves  in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a [[grandiose]] sense of their own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 1114&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Leary, ''The Curse of the Self'' (OUP 2007) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to [[narcissistic rage]] at a sense of insult.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Egotism differs from both [[altruism]] – or acting to gain ''fewer'' values than are being given – and from [[egoism]], the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of "empirical egoism" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general –  necessitate having an inflated sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. C. Flügel]], ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1973) p. 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]], ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The over-evaluation of one's own ego&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] to the best of their own  knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]] and [[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner &amp; Cleese, ''Families'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Skynner]] however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where "your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner and John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing ''individual'' egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly and M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley, ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' (Penguin 1977) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Romanticism]] had already set in motion a countervailing current, what [[Richard Eldridge]] described as a kind of "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eldridge, ''The Persistence of Romanticism'' (2001) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 563–4&lt;/ref&gt; – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. [[Keats]] might still attack [[Wordsworth]] for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hart, ''Robert Lowell and the Sublime'' (1995) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the [[Me generation]] into the [[Culture of Narcissism]].

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 565-6&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest,  as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sex==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. [[Sigmund Freud]] popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; giving him or her a new sense of  humility in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 516-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek ("εγώ") and subsequently its Latinised ego (''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]''), meaning "self" or "I," and ''[[-ism]]'', used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with [[wikt:egoism|egoism]].

==Cultural examples==
* [[A. A. Milne]] has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thwaite, ''A. A. Milne: His Life'' (2006) p. 123 and p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ryan Holiday]] described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ego Is The Enemy|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780698192157|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

[[Image:Youth and Time 1901.jpg|thumb|''Youth and Time'', [[John William Godward]], 1901]]

'''Eternal youth''' is the concept of human physical [[immortality]] free of [[ageing]]. The [[youth]] referred to is usually meant to be in contrast to the depredations of aging, rather than a specific age of the human lifespan. Achieving eternal youth so far remains beyond the capabilities of scientific technology. However, much research is being conducted in the sciences of genetics which may allow manipulation of the aging process in the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Eternal youth is common in mythology, and is a popular theme in [[fiction]].

==Religion and mythology==
Eternal youth is a characteristic of the inhabitants of [[Paradise]] in [[Abrahamic religion]]s.

The Hindus believe that the Vedic and the post-Vedic rishis have attained immortality, which implies the ability to change one's body's age or even shape at will. These are some of the [[siddha]]s in [[Yoga]]. [[Markandeya]] is said to always stay at the age of 16.

The difference between eternal life and the more specific eternal youth is a recurrent theme in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The [[mytheme]] of requesting the boon of immortality from a god, but forgetting to ask for eternal youth appears in the story of [[Tithonus]]. A similar theme is found in [[Ovid]] regarding the [[Cumaean Sibyl]].

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Iðunn]] is described as providing the gods [[apple]]s that grant them eternal youthfulness in the 13th century [[Prose Edda]].

==Telomeres==
An individual's [[DNA]] plays a role in the aging process. Aging begins even before birth, as soon as cells start to die and need to be replaced. On the ends of each [[chromosome]] are repetitive sequences of DNA, [[telomeres]], that protect the chromosome from joining with other chromosomes, and have several key roles. One of these roles is to regulate cell division by allowing each cell division to remove a small amount of genetic code. The amount removed varies by the cell type being replicated. The gradual degradation of the telomeres restricts cell division to 40-60 times, also known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. Once this limit has been reached, more cells die than can be replaced in the same time span. Thus, soon after this limit is reached the organism dies. The importance of telomeres is now clearly evident: lengthen the telomeres, lengthen the life.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

However, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 761–768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x | pmid = 21518243 | pmc=3387546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in a some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cherif H, Tarry JL, Ozanne SE, Hales CN | year = 2003 | title = Ageing and telomeres: a study into organ- and gender-specific telomere shortening | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–1583 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg208 | pmid = 12595567 | pmc=149817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23–74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renault V, Thornell LE, Eriksson PO, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V | year = 2003 | title = Regenerative potential of human skeletal muscle during aging | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 132–139 | pmid = 12882343 | doi=10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyapalan JC, Ferreira M, Sedivy JM, Herbig U | year = 2007 | title = Accumulation of senescent cells in mitotic tissue of aging primates | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 36–44 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2006.11.008 | pmid = 17116315 | pmc=3654105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.

Studies have shown that 90 percent of [[cancer]] cells contain large amounts of an [[enzyme]] called [[telomerase]].&lt;ref name="Damm"/&gt; Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes the worn away telomeres by adding bases to the ends and thus renewing the telomere. A cancer cell has in essence turned on the telomerase gene, and this allows them to have an unlimited amount of divisions without the telomeres wearing away. Other kinds of cells that can surpass the Hayflick limit are [[stem cells]], [[hair follicles]], and [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="Hornsby"/&gt; This is because they contain raised amounts of telomerase.

==Therapy==
The idea that the human body can be repaired in old age to a more youthful state has gathered significant commercial interest over the past few years, including by companies such as [[Human Longevity Inc]], [[Google Calico]], and [[Elysium Health]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition to these larger companies, many startups are currently developing therapeutics to tackle the 'ageing problem' using therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esthechoc: Scientists invent 'anti-ageing' chocolate|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/esthechoc-scientists-invent-antiageing-chocolate-10060075.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Alkahest inks a $50M deal for anti-aging R&amp;D|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/startup-alkahest-inks-50m-deal-anti-aging-rd/2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a new class of drugs [[senolytics]] was announced (currently in pre-clinical development) designed specifically to combat the underlying biological causes of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Senolytic" Drugs Can Dramatically Increase Healthy Lifespan|url=http://io9.com/new-senolytic-drugs-can-dramatically-increase-healthy-1690827868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The "loss of youth" or ageing process is responsible for increasing the risk of individuals to many diseases including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's]], and others. As a result, in recent years, many high net worth individuals have donated large amounts of their money towards initiatives towards scientific research into the ageing process itself or therapies to slow or reverse the ageing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT Scientist Claims That This Pill Is the Fountain of Youth|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|date=August 23, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people include [[Peter Thiel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel embarks on anti-aging crusade|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/08/billionaire-peter-thiel-may-want-to-live-forever/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=terview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD|url=http://www.lef.org/magazine/2013/7/Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD/Page-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Ellison]], [[Sergey Brin]], [[Dmitry Itskov]], [[Paul Gallen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Tech Billionaires Are Determined to Buy Their Way Out of Death |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-immortality-2013-8?IR=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Zuckerberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-zuckerberg-brin-life.html|title=Zuckerberg, Brin join forces to extend life|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow humans to extend or maintain their youth indefinitely.

[[File:Pairwise coevolution.svg|right|thumb|'''Pairwise coevolution'''
When [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] received an [[Angraecum sesquipedale|orchid]] from [[Madagascar]] whose [[nectary]] was one and a half feet long, he surmised that there must be a [[pollinator]] [[moth]] with a [[proboscis]] long enough to reach the nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kritsky | first1 = G | year = 1991 | title = Darwin's Madagascan Hawk Moth prediction | url = | journal = American Entomologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 206–209 | doi=10.1093/ae/37.4.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its attempt to get the nectar, the moth would have [[pollen]] rubbed onto its head, and the next orchid visited would then be pollinated. In 1903, such a moth was discovered: ''[[Xanthopan morganii]]''. This was an example of an evolutionary [[prediction]]. However, because species coevolve within large networks of multispecies ecological interactions, this example of [[pairwise coevolution]] is more the exception than the rule.]]
'''Evolving digital ecological networks''' are webs of interacting, [[self-replication|self-replicating]], and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s (i.e., [[digital organism]]s) that experience the same major [[ecology|ecological interactions]] as [[biological organism]]s (e.g., [[Competition (biology)|competition]], [[predation]], [[parasitism]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological [[Biological network|networks]] can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism [[phenotype]]s. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of [[Boolean logic|logical computations]] (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed [[behavior (biology)|behaviors]] that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within [[evolutionary ecology]] (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).

==Overview==
In nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species. One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by [[Biological interaction|patterns of interaction]] between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Post DM, Palkovacs EP | title = Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in community and ecosystem ecology: interactions between the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janzen DH | year = 1990 | title = When is it coevolution? | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 611–612 | doi=10.2307/2408229}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pair-wise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox LR | year = 1988 | title = Diffuse coevolution within complex communities | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 906–907 | doi=10.2307/1941243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thompson JN | date = 1994 | title = The coevolutionary process | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation.&lt;ref name=webOfLife/&gt;

A meta-analysis of [[bacteriophage|host-phage]] interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores CO, Meyer JR, Valverde S, Farr L, Weitz JS | title = Statistical structure of host-phage interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 28 | pages = E288-97 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21709225 | pmc = 3136311 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101595108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled.

Digital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolve the ability to infect a novel host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer JR, Dobias DT, Weitz JS, Barrick JE, Quick RT, Lenski RE | title = Repeatability and contingency in the evolution of a key innovation in phage lambda | journal = Science | volume = 335 | issue = 6067 | pages = 428–32 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22282803 | pmc = 3306806 | doi = 10.1126/science.1214449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in order to obtain [[statistical power]] for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This [[stochastic]] nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry ("''What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?''"&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1990) Wonderful life: the Burgess Shale and the nature of history. W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;) Because of their ease in scalability and [[Replication (statistics)|replication]], evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of ''replaying the tape of life''. Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species.

The inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists.

==History==

===Coreworld===

The field of digital life was inspired by the rampant [[computer virus]]es of the 1980s. These viruses were self-replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. [[Steen Rasmussen]] was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once-popular [[Core War]] game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rasmussen S, Knudsen C, Feldberg R, Hindsholm M | year = 1990 | title = The coreworld: emergence and evolution of cooperative structures in a computational chemistry | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(90)90070-6 | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 111–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early [[genetic programming]] language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, [[Thomas S. Ray]] developed an alternative system, [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]], and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs.&lt;ref name=Tierra&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ray TS | year = 1992 | chapter = An approach to the synthesis of life. | veditors = Langton CG, Taylor C, Farmer JD, Rasmussen S | title = Proceedings of Artificial Life | volume = II | pages = 371-408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tierra===

Thomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his [[artificial life]] system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the ''privately'' allocated [[computer memory|memory space]], thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others.&lt;ref name=Tierra /&gt; The only [[evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication [[source code|code]] in other organisms, allowing those [[cheating (biology)|"cheaters"]], which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years.

===Avida===

In 1993, [[Chris Adami|Christoph Adami]], [[Charles Ofria]], and C. Titus Brown created the artificial life platform [[Avida]]&lt;ref name=Avida&gt;[http://avida.devosoft.org/download/ Avida download page] ([https://www.webcitation.org/68kLnHVkF WebCite archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilke /&gt; at [[Caltech|the California Institute of Technology]]. They added the ability for digital organisms to obtain bonus [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] for performing computational tasks, like adding two numbers together. In Avida, researchers can define the available tasks and set the consequences for organisms upon successful calculation.&lt;ref name=wilke&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ofria C, Wilke CO | title = Avida: a software platform for research in computational evolutionary biology | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–229 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15107231 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1162/106454604773563612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When organisms are rewarded with additional CPU cycles, their replication rate increases. Since Avida was designed specifically as a scientific tool, it allows users to collect a comprehensive suite of data about evolving populations. Due to its flexibility and data tracking abilities, Avida has become the most widely used digital system for studying evolution. The Devolab&lt;ref name=Devolab&gt;[http://devolab.msu.edu/ Devolab]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[BEACON Center]] currently continues development of Avida.

[[File:Self-replication.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Self-replication of a digital organism.'''
The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]] are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware ''[[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]'' are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by ''r''. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an ''i'') advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the [[offspring]], and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a ''w'') into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an ''f'') is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the read and write heads and copies instructions from the parent genome (read-head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the [[control flow|execution flow]], showing most of the [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] being used during the copying process. After genome replication is complete, the parent organism divides off its offspring, which must now fend for itself within the Avida world.

==Implementation==

===Digital organisms===

Digital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs with a genome composed of assembly-like instructions. The genetic programming language in Avida contains instructions for manipulating values in [[processor register|registers]] and [[stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] as well as for [[control flow]] and mathematical operations. Each digital organism contains [[virtual machine|virtual hardware]] on which its genome is executed. To reproduce, digital organisms must copy their genome instruction by instruction into a new region of [[computer memory|memory]] through a potentially [[Noisy channel coding theorem|noisy channel]] that may lead to errors (i.e., [[mutation]]s). While most mutations are detrimental, [[mutant]]s will occasionally have higher fitness than their parents, thereby providing the basis for [[natural selection]] with all of the necessary components for [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]]. Digital organisms can acquire random [[Boolean algebra|binary numbers]] from the environment and are able to manipulate them using their genetic instructions, including the logic instruction ''[[NAND logic|NAND]]''. With only this instruction, digital organisms can compute any other task by stringing together various operations because NAND is a universal logic function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenski RE, Ofria C, Collier TC, Adami C | title = Genome complexity, robustness and genetic interactions in digital organisms | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6745 | pages = 661–4 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10458160 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/23245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the output of processing random numbers from the environment corresponds to the result of a particular [[Boolean algebra|logic task]], then that task is incorporated into the set of tasks the organism performs, which in turn, defines part of its [[phenotype]].

===Digital interactions===

Interactions between digital organisms occur through phenotypic matching, which, in the case of task-based phenotypes, results from the performance of overlapping logic functions. Different mechanisms for mapping phenotypic matching to interactions can be implemented, depending on the antagonistic or mutualistic nature of the interaction.

[[Image:Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions.svg|500px|thumb|'''Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions'''
Digital organisms process [[Binary numeral system|binary numbers]] taken from the environment using the instructions that constitute their [[genome]]s. When the output of processing those numbers equals the result of applying a [[Boolean algebra|logic function]], the digital organism is said to have performed that task. The combination of tasks performed by a digital organism partially defines its phenotype. The center of the figure depicts the output of applying eight [[Truth table|logical operators]] (tasks) on the two input numbers above. On the left and right, five hypothetical [[Host (biology)|host]] (green) and [[Parasitism|parasite]] (red) phenotypes are represented as columns (on the top) and as circles (below). On the top, each column depicts a phenotype and each row represents a task. Tasks performed by each phenotype are filled. In the lower part, the interaction networks between hosts and parasites are illustrated, which result from phenotypic matching: a parasite infects a host (indicated by a line) if it performs at least one task that is also performed by the host. Inset numbers indicate the identity of phenotypes represented on the top. Arrows represent the temporal direction of the [[coevolution|coevolutionary process]]: from the earliest phenotype to the most recent one. The order of tasks (from top to bottom) indicates the time needed for a digital organism to perform that task over the course of the evolutionary trajectory. Depending on the pattern of tasks performed by the digital organisms, a [[modularity|modular]] (left) or [[nestedness|nested]] (right) interaction network can emerge.]]

====Host-parasite interactions====

In [[parasitism|host-parasite interactions]], the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside [[host (biology)|hosts]] and execute parasitic [[thread (computing)|threads]] using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Zaman, L., Devangam, S, Ofria, C. (2011). Rapid host-parasite coevolution drives the production and maintenance of diversity in digital organisms. Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (GECCO), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. [[infectious disease|Infection]] occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton A, Antonovics J, Brockhurst MA | title = Inverse-gene-for-gene infection genetics and coevolutionary dynamics | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = E230-42 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19852618 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/645087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and [[Gene-for-gene relationship|gene-for-gene]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal A, Lively CM | year = 2002 | title = Infection genetics: gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models an all points in between | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 79–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be implemented.

In traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations.&lt;ref name="Bohannan BJM 2000"/&gt; Costs are also present in digital host-parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance.

By keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the [[community (ecology)|community]], researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites. The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poulin R | title = Network analysis shining light on parasite ecology and diversity | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 492–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20561821 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2010.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avida host-parasite coevolution web.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Evolving host-parasite webs.'''
Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges from the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of [[infectious disease|infections]] that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes.

====Mutualistic interactions====

Interactions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host-parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for "plant" organisms and one for "pollinator" organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guimarães PR, Jordano P, Thompson JN | title = Evolution and coevolution in mutualistic networks | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 877–85 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21749596 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01649.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Predator-prey interactions====

While [[host-parasite coevolution|host-parasite]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes, [[predation|predator-prey]] interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. [[natural selection|Selection]] favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using [[spatial ecology|spatially structured populations]]. On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.

==Research directions==
{{essay|section|date=October 2014}}
Understanding how [[biodiversity]] is organized in [[ecosystem|natural ecosystems]] requires going beyond the study of pairs of interacting species. Using digital organisms, one can find generalities about the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the web of interactions among species, as well as the coevolutionary processes embedded within these networks. By tracing the evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks, researchers obtain perfect ''[[fossil|fossil records]]'' of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved.

The stability-diversity debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCann KS | title = The diversity-stability debate | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6783 | pages = 228–33 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10821283 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/35012234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Until recently, this debate has focused on one component of biodiversity: species diversity. However, newer research has begun dealing with another component of biodiversity: diversity in species interactions. Mathematical models show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougi A, Kondoh M | title = Diversity of interaction types and ecological community stability | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6092 | pages = 349–51 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22822151 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1220529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies with digital organisms can shed light on this debate from an empirical perspective because the types of interactions included can be manipulated and the stability of the resulting evolving digital ecological network can be measured.

Equally addressable using evolving digital ecological networks are many of the open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities. For example, do [[coevolution|coevolutionary dynamics]] change as communities become richer? Is there any limit to their richness? Is the evolution of interactions between multispecies networks [[contingency (philosophy)|historically contingent]]? Why do some ecological scenarios lead to predictable network structures and others do not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thébault E, Fontaine C | title = Stability of ecological communities and the architecture of mutualistic and trophic networks | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5993 | pages = 853–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20705861 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1188321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Do [[adaptationism#Genetic constraints|genetic constraints]] play a large role in the evolution of ecological networks? These are only a few of many open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities.

These and many related questions require researchers to look across the [[evolutionary history of life|evolutionary history]] of ecological network formation. For natural systems, those data are very difficult to collect. With digital organisms, watching both the coevolutionary process and ecological network formation is possible in real time. Data on the abundance of interacting phenotypes are recorded without error, hence the evolutionary implications of ecological processes can be explored in-depth.

The study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing glimpse into the evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these digital networks contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite of the differences between biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving digital ecological networks can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism) do not differ, studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.

'''Existential nihilism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory that [[life]] has no intrinsic [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] or [[value (ethics)|value]]. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being born into the universe, barred from knowing "why", yet compelled to invent meaning.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Embry-Riddle University |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]], where one can potentially create their own subjective "meaning" or "purpose". Of all types of [[nihilism]], existential nihilism has received the most literary and philosophical attention.&lt;ref name="cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/257/379 |title=
Nihilism, Nature, and the Collapse of the Cosmos |author=David Storey |date=2011 |work=Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of life==
The idea that meaning and values are without foundation is a form of [[nihilism]], and the existential response to that idea is noting that meaning is not "a matter of contemplative theory," but instead, "a consequence of engagement and commitment."

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote in his essay ''[[Existentialism and Humanism]]'', "What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him as not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself." Here it is made clear what is meant by Existentialists when they say meaning is "a consequence of engagement and commitment".

The theory purports to describe the human situation to create a life outlook and create meaning, which has been summarized as, "Strut, fret, and delude ourselves as we may, our lives are of no significance, and it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref name="crosby"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existential nihilists claim that, to be honest, one must face the [[absurdism|absurdity]] of existence, that he/she will eventually die, and that both [[religion]] and [[metaphysics]] are simply results of the fear of death.&lt;ref name="cosmos"/&gt;

According to [[Donald A. Crosby]], "There is no justification for life, but also no reason not to live. Those who claim to find meaning in their lives are either dishonest or deluded. In either case, they fail to face up to the harsh reality of the human situations".&lt;ref name="crosby"/&gt;

==History==
Existential nihilism has been a part of the Western intellectual tradition since the [[Cyrenaics]], such as [[Hegesias of Cyrene]]. During the Renaissance, [[William Shakespeare]] eloquently summarized the existential nihilist's perspective through Macbeth's mindset in the end of [[Macbeth|the eponymous play]]. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] further expanded on these ideas, and Nietzsche, particularly, has become a major figure in existential nihilism.

The [[Atheistic existentialism|atheistic existentialist]] movement spread in 1940s France. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' discussed the topic. Camus wrote further works, such as ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'', ''[[The Plague]]'', ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''.&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; Other figures include [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. In addition, [[Ernest Becker|Ernest Becker's]] Pulitzer Prize winning life's work ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' is a collection of thoughts on existential nihilism.

{{quote|The common thread in the literature of the existentialists is coping with the emotional anguish arising from our confrontation with nothingness, and they expended great energy responding to the question of whether surviving it was possible. Their answer was a qualified "Yes," advocating a formula of passionate commitment and [[Apatheia|impassive stoicism]].|[[Alan Pratt]]&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population. Demographic Realities: Opportunities and Challenges |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |url=http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028115440/http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that in 2002, 7% of the world's population is aged 65 and above. By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|aging population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, '''''Gerontechnology''''' [http://www.gerontechjournal.net], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive edited book "'''''Gerontechnology'''''" [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html]has been published in 2016.

== Education ==
[[Image:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

'''Harald Olav Aabrekk''' (born 22 February 1956) is a Norwegian [[association football|football]] coach and a former player. He played for [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] and [[SK Brann|Brann]] in the [[Tippeligaen]], Norway's top professional football league. He has been head coach of Sogndal, [[Tromsø IL|Tromsø]], Brann, [[FK Haugesund|Haugesund]], [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]] and [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]],  and has also served as an assistant coach for the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national football team]].

==Playing career==
Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] (the third tier of Norwegian football).&lt;ref name="Sogndal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Alaget/Spelarstall/Spelarinfo/tabid/620/person/504/mid/1437/Default.aspx |title=Harald Aabrekk – Statistikk Sogndal |publisher=[[Sogndal Fotball]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenpå90talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |title=90-talet og Hardal Aabrekk |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208033129/http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenp%C3%A590talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the [[Tippeligaen]] (the top division) in [[1978 Norwegian First Division|1978]],&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brann.no/historie/spillerdatabase/spillerarkiv/harald-aabrekk/ |title=Statistics; Brann |publisher=[[SK Brann]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the [[Norwegian First Division]] in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against [[Molde FK|Molde]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the [[1982 Norwegian First Division|First Division in 1982]].&lt;ref name="Sogndal"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Aabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and [[Stryn TIL|Stryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir ny Sogndal-trener |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801042447/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Nyheter/Aktuelt/tabid/486/smid/1092/ArticleID/10197/reftab/360/t/Harald-Aabrekk-er-tilbake/Default.aspx |language=Norwegian |title=Harald Aabrekk er tilbake |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against [[Bryne FK|Bryne]] in their first home match.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |title=Trist redningsmann |first=Roy |last=Ellingsen |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917153008/http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, during a match against [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]], Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/11/04/481856.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fotballens største skuespillere |work=[[Dagbladet]] |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', he excused his behavior by saying, "I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout." This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'', was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt;

Aabrekk later worked for the [[Football Association of Norway]] as a coordinator for youth development in [[Western Norway]]. He also served as [[Nils Johan Semb]]'s assistant coach for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norwegian under-21 team]] from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded [[Egil Olsen]] as head coach of the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national team]] in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; At the same time, he worked as [[Kjell Tennfjord]]'s assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach.&lt;ref name="tilbake"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tilbake i Brann |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222190913/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Brann to the finals of the [[1999 Norwegian Football Cup|1999 Norwegian Cup]], where they lost 2–0 against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/1999/10/31/181874.html |language=Norwegian |title=Uten Aabrekk slokner Brann |work=Dagbladet |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] football championship.

Following the 2011 season, Aabrekk retired. In his last match, he was named "Best Sogndal coach ever".&lt;ref name="tidenes"/&gt;

Aabrekk was hired as manager for Aalesunds FK before the 2015 season, but sacked four matches into the season, when his club was last in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smp.no/100Sport/fotball/eliteserien/article527177.snd|title = Harald Aabrekk sparket som Aalesund-trener|date = 28 April 2015|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Lesley Aagaard''' (born 1956) is a former [[Australia]]n politician. She was an [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] member of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] from 2001 to 2012, representing the [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]-based electorate of [[electoral division of Nightcliff|Nightcliff]]. She was the [[Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]] from June 2005 until October 2012—to date, the only Labor member ever to hold the post. Prior to holding the speakership, she had served as Health Minister from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parl.php3?srch=parl&amp;list_params=gender%3D%26offices_held%3D%26party%3D%26parliament%3D%26surname%3DAagaard%26electorate%3D%26former_occupations%3D&amp;ID=612|title=Hon. Jane Lesley AAGAARD MLA|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Jane Aagaard was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1956, to John Stuart McIntosh and Jean Brown. She moved to [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] at the age of seven, where she was educated at [[Somerville House]], a school for girls in [[South Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = Suzannah Pearce| encyclopedia = Who's Who in Business Live!| title = AAGAARD Jane Lesley, Hon. |date=2006-11-17| publisher = Crown Content Pty Ltd| location = North Melbourne, Vic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, she accepted a position with the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and settled with her husband in Darwin.

Aagaard also became heavily involved in many aspects of the Darwin community. She helped found the [[Brolga Awards]] and [[Northern Territory Sports Awards]], and continued organising both presentations for several years. Not long before entering parliament, she had also organised the city's commemoration of its bombing by [[Japan]]ese forces during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Camden. "Aagaard to stand for Nightcliff seat". ''[[Northern Territory News]]'', 7 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

When former [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|Chief Minister]] [[Stephen Hatton]], the longtime [[Country Liberal Party|CLP]] member for Nightcliff, retired at the 2001 election, Aagaard ran as the Labor candidate against Hatton's son, Jason.  In a shock result, Aagaard won the seat on an unexpectedly large swing of 11.7 percent that saw the previously marginal Nightcliff technically become a safe Labor seat.  Aagaard's victory was part of a six-seat swing to Labor that saw the party win government for the first time ever, mainly on the strength of a strong performance in the Darwin area.  She was reelected in 2005, picking up a healthy swing of 8.5 percent

In March 2012, Aargard announced that she would not contest [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|the next election]] due to "ongoing medical issues that would require treatment and surgery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/03/25/295785_ntnews.html |title=Speaker Aagaard to retire from politics |publisher=NT News |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Aargard was granted the title The Honourable for life.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012G00283 Ms Jane Lesley Aagaard granted the title "Honourable" for life], ''Commonwealth Government Gazette'' C2012G00283, S No. 177 of 2012, 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langton's ant''' is a two-dimensional [[universal Turing machine]] with a very simple set of rules but complex [[Emergence|emergent]] behavior. It was invented by [[Chris Langton]] in 1986 and runs on a [[Square tiling|square lattice]] of black and white cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(86)90237-X | last = Langton | first = Chris G. | title = Studying artificial life with cellular automata | year = 1986 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 22 | pages = 120–149 | hdl = 2027.42/26022 | issue = 1-3| url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26022/1/0000093.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Computationally universal|universality]] of Langton's ant was proven in 2000.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000" /&gt; The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as [[turmite]]s which add more colors and more states.

[[File:LangtonsAntAnimated.gif|500px|right|thumb|Animation of first 200 steps of Langton's ant]]

Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily identify one square as the "ant". The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The "ant" moves according to the rules below:
* At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Langton's ant can also be described as a [[cellular automaton]], where the grid is colored black or white and the "ant" square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000" /&gt;

==Modes of behavior==
These simple rules lead to complex behavior. Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|title=The Science Of Discworld|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; when starting on a completely white grid.

#Simplicity. During the first few hundred moves it creates very simple patterns which are often symmetric.
#Chaos. After a few hundred moves, a big, irregular pattern of black and white squares appears. The ant traces a pseudo-random path until around 10,000 steps.
#Emergent order. Finally the ant starts building a recurrent "highway" pattern of 104 steps that repeats indefinitely.

All finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern, suggesting that the "highway" is an [[attractor]] of Langton's ant, but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations. It is only known that the ant's trajectory is always unbounded regardless of the initial configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bunimovich |first=Leonid A. |last2=Troubetzkoy |first2=Serge E. |title=Recurrence properties of Lorentz lattice gas cellular automata |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=67 |issue=1-2 |pages=289–302 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF01049035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[E.G.D. Cohen|Cohen]]–Kung theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=I. |title=The Ultimate in Anty-Particles |journal=Sci. Am. |volume=271 |pages=104–107 |year=1994 |url=http://dev.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/AntyParticles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universality==

In 2000, Gajardo et al. showed a construction that calculates any [[boolean circuit]] using the trajectory of a single instance of Langton's ant.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajardo |first1=A. |last2=Moreira |first2=A. |last3=Goles |first3=E. |title=Complexity of Langton's ant |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=117 |issue=1-3 |pages=41–50 |date=15 March 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0166-218X(00)00334-6 |url=http://www.dim.uchile.cl/~anmoreir/oficial/langton_dam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it would be possible to simulate an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] using the ant's trajectory for computation. This means that the ant is capable of universal computation.

==Extension to multiple colors==

[[Greg Turk]] and [[Jim Propp]] considered a simple extension to Langton's ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gale |first1=D. |last2=Propp |first2=J. |last3=Sutherland |first3=S. |last4=Troubetzkoy |first4=S. |title=Further Travels with My Ant|journal=Mathematical Entertainments column, Mathematical Intelligencer |year=1995 |volume=17|pages=48–56 |url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/cgi-bin/preprint.pl?ims95-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter "L" or "R" is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. Langton's ant has the name "RL" in this naming scheme.

Some of these extended Langton's ants produce patterns that become [[symmetric]] over and over again. One of the simplest examples is the ant "RLLR". One sufficient condition for this to happen is that the ant's name, seen as a cyclic list, consists of consecutive pairs of identical letters "LL" or "RR" (the term "cyclic list" indicates that the last letter may pair with the first one). The proof involves [[Truchet tiles]].

&lt;gallery caption="Some example patterns in the multiple-color extension of Langton's ants:"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The hexagonal grid permits up to six different rotations, which are notated here as N (no change), R1 (60° clockwise), R2 (120° clockwise), U (180°), L2 (120° counter-clockwise), L1 (60° counter-clockwise).

==Extension to multiple states==
{{Main|Turmite}}
A further extension of Langton's ants is to consider multiple states of the Turing machine – as if the ant itself has a color that can change. These ants are called [[turmite]]s, a contraction of "Turing machine [[termites]]". Common behaviours include the production of highways, chaotic growth and spiral growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Pegg, Jr. | first = Ed | title = Turmite | publisher = From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by [[Eric W.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Extension to multiple ants==
Multiple Langton's ants can co-exist on the 2D plane, and their interactions give rise to complex, higher-order automata that collectively build a wide variety of organized structures. There is no need for conflict resolution, as every ant sitting on the same square wants to make the same change to the tape. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XQQhCgq5c YouTube video] showing these multiple ant interactions.

Multiple turmites can co-exist on the 2D plane as long as there is a rule for what happens when they meet. [[Ed Pegg, Jr.]] considered ants that can turn for example ''both'' left and right, splitting in two and annihilating each other when they meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Pegg, Jr. | first = Ed | title = Math Puzzle | url=http://www.mathpuzzle.com/26Mar03.html | accessdate = 15 October 2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''last universal common ancestor''' ('''LUCA'''), also called the '''last universal ancestor''' ('''LUA'''),  '''cenancestor''', or (incorrectly&lt;ref group=R&gt;There is a common misconception that definitions of LUCA and progenote are the same; however, progenote is defined as an organism “still in the process of evolving the relationship between genotype and phenotype”, and it is only hypothesed that LUCA is a progenote.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gogarten|first1=Johann Peter|last2=Deamer|first2=David|title=Is LUCA a thermophilic progenote?|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=1|date=25 November 2016|page=16229|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;) '''progenote''', is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now [[Life|living on Earth]] have a [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theobald DL |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–22 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20463738 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T}}&lt;/ref&gt; LUCA is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the [[first living organism on Earth]], but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. 

While there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by [[phylogenetic bracketing|comparing the genomes of its descendants]], all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 [[gene]]s inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many [[co-adapted]] features, including [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] mechanisms to convert information between [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725" /&gt; However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="GogartenDeamer2016" /&gt;

LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the [[Paleoarchean]] [[era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doolittle WF|date=February 2000|title=Uprooting the tree of life|journal=Scientific American|volume=282|issue=2|pages=90–95|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|pmid=10710791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Glansdorff N, Xu Y, Labedan B|year=2008|title=The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner|journal=Biology Direct|volume=3|issue=|page=29|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-29|pmc=2478661|pmid=18613974}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few hundred million years after the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence of life on Earth]], for which there are several candidates.

[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, saying, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=C. |year=1859 |title=[[The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]] |page=490 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have separated the problem of the [[origin of life]] from that of the LUCA.

==Features==
{{further information|Phylogenetic bracketing}}

By [[phylogenetic bracketing|analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups]], the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of [[DNA]] floating freely within the cell, like modern [[bacteria]]. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, [[Carl Woese]] ''et al.'', who first proposed the currently-used [[Three-domain system|three domain system]] based on an analysis of &lt;!--the 16S --&gt;[[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a "...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1990 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=2112744 |pages=4576–79 |volume=87 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 |first=C.

 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four [[nucleotide]]s: [[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]], and [[deoxyguanosine]]. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[enzyme]], [[DNA polymerase]]. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and  [[DNA repair|repair]] enzymes including [[DNA topoisomerase]] and [[DNA ligase]]. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as [[histone]]s. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide [[codons]] which redundantly coded for 20 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;
If the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide [[thymidine]] was replaced by [[uridine]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The genetic code was expressed into [[protein]]s. These were assembled from free [[amino acid]]s by [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of a [[messenger RNA]] via a mechanism of [[ribosome]]s, [[transfer RNA]]s, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big [[50S]] and a small [[30S]].  Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by [[ribosomal protein]]s. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 [[amino acids]] were used, only in [[Chirality (chemistry)|L-isomers]], to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein [[enzymes]] catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, Albermarle Street. 1859. pp. 484, 490.&lt;/ref&gt; The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one..."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"/&gt;

When the LUCA was hypothesized, [[cladogram]]s based on [[genetic distance]] between living cells indicated that [[Archaea]] split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high [[salinity]], [[temperature]] or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the [[black smoker|deep ocean vents]], where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the [[Eukaryota]] than to the [[Bacteria]], although many details are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xie, Q. |author2=Wang, Y. |author3=Lin, J. |author4=Qin, Y. |author5=Wang, Y. |author6=Bu, W. |title=Potential key bases of ribosomal RNA to kingdom-specific spectra of antibiotic susceptibility and the possible archaeal origin of eukaryotes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29468 |year=2012 |pmid=22247777 |pmc=3256160 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029468|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729468X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yutin, N. |author2=Makarova K.S. |author3=Mekhedov S.L. |author4=Wolf, Y.I. |author5=Koonin, E.V. |title=The deep archaeal roots of eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1619–30 |date=August 2008  |pmid=18463089 |pmc=2464739 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding segments]]. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the [[Paleoarchean|Paleoarchean Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egel|first1=Richard|title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life|journal=Life|date=March 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=170–212|doi=10.3390/life2010170|pmc=4187143|pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the [[Chargaff's rules|AT/GC]] rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.

In an earlier hypothesis, [[Carl Woese]] (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through [[horizontal gene transfer]] among an ancient community of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woese C |title=The universal ancestor |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6854–59 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9618502 |pmc=22660 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6854 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6854W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved.&lt;ref name="majortransinevolution"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Major Transitions in Evolution | last=Maynard Smith | first=John | authorlink=John Maynard Smith |first2=Eörs |last2=Szathmáry |author2link=Eörs Szathmáry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1995 | location=Oxford, England | isbn=0-19-850294-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.

Ground-breaking research by [[William F.

Jesus, Griffin played in local Dallas bands [[The Telefones]] and Lithium X-Mas.

==Career==

''[[Hell with the Lid Off]]'' (1990) was Griffin's first full-length release for MC 900 Ft. Jesus as well as the first time Griffin had appeared on a major record label. Featuring DJ Zero (Patrick Rollins) and  the single "Truth is Out of Style" which gained a cult following.&lt;ref name="Heim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Migaldi|first=Renaldo|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mc-900-ft-jesus-with-dj-zero/Content?oid=875487|title=MC 900 Ft. Jesus with DJ Zero|date=April 12, 1990|newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year ''Welcome to My Dream'' (1991) was released. DJ Zero appears on ''Welcome to My Dream'' under his real name, Patrick Rollins, because of uncertainty about whether he would have been able to tour in support of the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Popson|first=Tom|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-08/entertainment/9104100619_1_ft-jesus-cameras-magazine|title=Mc 900 Ft Jesus: A Fascination With Aberration|date=November 8, 1991|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent single, "The City Sleeps", was featured in the album in which explored the mind of a serial [[arsonist]].&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt; The song sparked controversy in [[Baltimore]] when a then [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WJZ-TV|WJZ]], ran a report suggesting that a series of arson in the area was a result of [[WHFS (historic)|WHFS]] allowing the song play time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/01/29/on-the-beat/5911bb51-a181-4dba-8675-1eaeab741822/&lt;/ref&gt;

His final album, ''[[One Step Ahead of the Spider]]'', was released in 1994; it contained the single "If I Only Had a Brain", which became his best-known song. The song gained increased exposure from the music video directed for it by [[Spike Jonze]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vognar|first=Chris|url=http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2014/01/spike-jonze-dishes-on-his-classic-music-videos-and-dallas-mc-900-ft-jesus.html/|title=Spike Jonze dishes on his classic music videos (and Dallas'MC 900 Ft.

===Retirement from music industry===

Griffin eventually became disillusioned with the music industry, and following unproductive sessions for his fourth album, felt he had taken his style of music as far as he wanted to go and overall losing interest in music citing [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="dallasobserver.com"&gt;http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/mc-900-ft-jesus-on-walking-away-from-his-career-i-lost-my-sense-of-humor-about-it-9092749&lt;/ref&gt; Record label interest waned and eventually in 2001, Griffin officially retired.&lt;ref name="Chamy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dallasobserver.com"/&gt; 
Needing a new direction, he gained his commercial pilot's license, hoping to become a flight instructor. However, when the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, demand plummeted for flight instructors and Griffin was unable to find a job. Eventually, Griffin took a job at a [[Borders Group|Borders]] bookstore.&lt;ref name="Hughey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/mc-900-ft-jesus-lives-6419623&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he began DJing weekly at a Dallas music venue, Lee Harvey's, located in the [[Cedars, Dallas|Cedars]] neighborhood next to downtown.&lt;ref name="Hughey" /&gt;

===Coming out of retirement===

On November 26, 2016, Griffin announced via Facebook that he was set to perform a show at The Kessler Theater in [[Dallas]] with a quartet including Chris McGuire, Greg Beck, and Wanz Dover in hopes of kick-starting a tour as well as a possible fourth album with his former label [[Nettwerk]] of which had approached Griffin about.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver.com"/&gt; On February 3, 2017, the quartet played a sold-out concert performing several of the MC 900 songs, receiving a rapturous ovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/mc-900-ft-jesus-returns-with-a-sold-out-show-at-the-kessler-9161473&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Griffin's stage name came from a sermon by [[Oral Roberts]], in which the [[televangelist]] claimed that he had received a vision of a {{convert|900|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} Jesus, who commanded him to build [[CityPlex Towers|a hospital]] on the campus of [[Oral Roberts University]].&lt;ref name="Brennan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heim" /&gt;

{{about|the Japanese mermaid analogue|''ningyō''|Japanese traditional dolls}}
{{nihongo|'''Ningyo'''|人魚||"human fish", often translated as "[[mermaid]]"}} is a [[fish]]-like creature from [[Japan]]ese [[folklore]].

==Mythology==
Anciently, it was described with a [[monkey]]’s mouth with small teeth like a fish’s, shining golden scales, and a quiet voice like a [[skylark]] or a flute. Its flesh is pleasant-tasting, and anyone who eats it will attain remarkable longevity. However, catching a ''ningyo'' was believed to bring storms and misfortune, so fishermen who caught these creatures were said to throw them back into the sea. A ''ningyo'' washed onto the beach was an omen of war or calamity.

===Yao Bikuni===
One of the most famous folk stories concerning ''ningyo'' is called {{nihongo|'''Yao [[Bhikkhuni|Bikuni]]'''|八百比丘尼||"eight-hundred (years) Buddhist priestess"}} or '''Happyaku Bikuni'''. The story tells how a fisherman who lived in [[Wakasa Province]] once caught an unusual fish. In all his years fishing, he had never seen anything like it, so he invited his friends over to sample its meat. 

One of the guests, however, peeked into the kitchen, noticed that the head of this fish had a human face, and warned the others not to eat it. So when the fisherman finished cooking and offered his guests the ''ningyo's'' grilled flesh, they secretly wrapped it in paper and hid it on their persons so that it could be discarded on the way home. 

But one man, drunk on ''[[sake]]'', forgot to throw the strange fish away. This man had a little daughter, who demanded a present when her father arrived home, and he carelessly gave her the fish. Coming to his senses, the father tried to stop her from eating it, fearing she would be poisoned, but he was too late and she finished it all. But as nothing particularly bad seemed to happen to the girl afterwards, the man did not worry about it for long.

Years passed, and the girl grew up and was married. But after that she did not age any more; she kept the same youthful appearance while her husband grew old and died. After many years of perpetual youth and being widowed again and again, the woman became a nun and wandered through various countries. Finally she returned to her hometown in Wakasa, where she ended her life at an age of 800 years.

==In popular culture==
* {{nihongo|''Fishmen''|魚人|Gyojin}}, often incorrectly referred to as Mermen, are a race who appear throughout the entire anime/manga series of ''[[One Piece]]'' on a regular basis. They look like humans with fish features and are obviously inspired by the ''ningyo''. ''Fishman'' is written like ''ningyo'' but with the characters switched (人魚, Ningyo -&gt; 魚人, Gyojin). {{nihongo|''Merfolk''|人魚|Ningyo}} appear in the series too. These are more peaceful of nature than the Fishmen and, like the [[mermaid]]s and [[merman|mermen]] of folklore, their upper half is that of a human while the lower half is that of a fish, though male Merfolk are somewhat uncommon. 
* The manga/anime series, ''[[Mermaid Saga]]'' by [[Rumiko Takahashi]] is based on the Yao Bikuni myth, in which the main characters become immortal by consuming the flesh of a mermaid.
* There is a fake "ningyo" in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Museum of Ethnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minpaku.ac.jp/staff/kondo/wp12.html 民族学者の仕事場： Vol.4 近藤雅樹] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822015108/http://www.minpaku.ac.jp/staff/kondo/wp12.html |date=2009-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jitsuwa.com/main-page/urakikou/text-6/no-1/index.html 驚異の伝承と新説 トンでも不思議発見 VOL.1「ミイラの謎が明かされた？！」 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The character Seriri from the [[Puyo Puyo (series)|Puyo Puyo]] series of games is a lonely ningyo who desires to make friends, but is often paranoid that everyone who approaches her wants to eat her.
* In [[Okinawa]], people have believed that eating ningyo would be unlucky. They also do not eat [[dugong]].
* The character "Ponyo" in the [[Ponyo|film of the same name]] is a ningyo or "human-faced fish".
* The primary [[antagonist]] of the video game ''[[Siren (video game)|Siren]]'' is based on the character Yao Bikuni, and the background of the story is loosely based on the Yao Bikuni legend.
* One of the "monsters of the day" in ''[[Tensou Sentai Goseiger]]'' is "Jogon of the Ningyo".
* The CCG and roleplaying game ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]'' has Ningyo characters as members of the Mantis Clan.
* A host of ningyo characters feature prominently in the manga and anime series ''[[Namiuchigiwa no Muromi-san]]''.
* In ''[[Yo-kai Watch]]'', Ningyo appears where it's English dub name is Mermaidyn. She is depicted as a mermaid who is constantly caught on the hook of Nate Adams' fishing pole much to his annoyance. Yao Bikuni also appears as Mermadonna who is Mermaidyn's evolved form.
* Bikuni appears in the anime ''[[Konohana Kitan]]'' as a secondary character.
* The film ''[[Lu Over the Wall|Lu over the Wall]]'' revolves around an idiosyncratic interpretation of ningyo in which they are a form of [[undead]].
* Yaobikuni is a playable character in the mobile RPG ''Onmyōji''.
* Yaobikuni is a character in the manga series ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">Flexible or '''opportunistic breeders''' mate whenever the conditions of their environment become favorable. Their ability and motivation to mate are primarily independent of day-length ([[photoperiod]]) and instead rely on cues from short-term changes in local conditions like rainfall, food abundance and temperature. Another factor is the presence of suitable breeding sites, which may only form with heavy rain or other environmental changes.&lt;ref name="Duellman"&gt;WE Duellman, L Trueb. ''Biology of amphibians.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, they are distinct from [[seasonal breeder]]s that rely on changes in day length to induce entry into [[estrus]] and to cue mating, and [[continuous breeder]]s like humans that can mate year-round. Other categories of breeders that perhaps can be subdivided under the heading "opportunistic" have been used to describe many species, such as many that are [[anuran]]s like frogs. These include '''sporadic wet''' and '''sporadic dry''', describing animals that breed sporadically not always under favorable conditions of rain or lack thereof.&lt;ref name="Duellman" /&gt;

Many opportunistic breeders are non-mammals. Those that are mammals tend to be small [[rodents]].&lt;ref&gt;Malpoux B. ''The Neuroendocrine Control of Seasonal Rhythms.'' In: Conn PM, Freeman ME, ed., Neuroendocrinology in physiology and medicine. Humana Press, 1999, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

Since changes in season can coincide with favorable changes in environment, the distinction between seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always perceptible and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the [[tree kangaroo]] (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R, Johnson P. ''Bennett's Tree-kangaroo.'' In: R. Straham, ed., Mammals of Australia, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995, pp. 307-8, {{PMID|16026787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, opportunists can have qualities of seasonal breeders. The [[red crossbill]] exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, in order to breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1365634 |author=H.B. Tordoff |author2=W.R. Dawson |title= The influence of daylength on reproductive timing in the red crossbill |journal=The Condor |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages= 416–22 |year= 1965 |jstor=1365634}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jez.1402720306 |author=T.P.

Exp. Zool. |volume=272 |pages=213–26 |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.

==Physiology==
Opportunistic breeders are typically capable of breeding at any time or becoming fertile within a short period of time. An example is the [[Acomys russatus|golden spiny mouse]] where changes in dietary salt in its desert habitat due to rainfall appear to cue reproductive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= U. Shanas |author2= A. Haim |title= Diet salinity and vasopressin as reproduction modulators in the desert-dwelling golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) |journal=Physiology and Behavior |volume=81 |pages=645–50 |year=2004 |pmid=15178158 |issue= 4 |doi= 10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.03.002|url=https://zenodo.org/record/905896/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased levels of salinity in drying vegetation cause females to experience a reproductive hiatus.

While reproduction is generally independent of photoperiod, animals can still experience reduced fertility with changes in day-length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C.

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Liu|first2=Lian|last3=Adhikari|first3=Deepak|last4=Jagarlamudi|first4=Krishna|last5=Rajareddy|first5=Singareddy|last6=Shen|first6=Yan|last7=Du|first7=Chun|last8=Tang|first8=Wenli|last9=Hämäläinen|first9=Tuula|date=2008-02-01|title=Oocyte-specific deletion of Pten causes premature activation of the primordial follicle pool|journal=Science|volume=319|issue=5863|pages=611–613|doi=10.1126/science.1152257|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18239123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuang|first=Haibin|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Peng|first3=Jing|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=December 2009|title=Premature ovarian failure, menopause and ovarian cancer, three nodes on the same string: Pten and other potential genes on the go|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=73|issue=6|pages=961–962|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.023|issn=1532-2777|pmid=19733443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

[[FOXO3|Foxo3a]] - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Wendy J.|last2=Umbers|first2=Alexandra J.|last3=Woad|first3=Kathryn J.|last4=Harris|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Winship|first5=Ingrid M.|last6=Gersak|first6=Ksenija|last7=Shelling|first7=Andrew N.|date=November 2006|title=Mutational screening of FOXO3A and FOXO1A in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1518–1521|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.054|issn=1556-5653|pmid=16979636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Binbin|last2=Mu|first2=Yuan|last3=Ni|first3=Feng|last4=Zhou|first4=Sirui|last5=Wang|first5=Jing|last6=Cao|first6=Yunxia|last7=Ma|first7=Xu|date=April 2010|title=Analysis of FOXO3 mutation in 114 Chinese women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=20|issue=4|pages=499–503|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.01.008|issn=1472-6491|pmid=20219431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Paratomy''' is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in animals where the organism splits in a plane perpendicular to the [[antero-posteriorly|antero-posterior axis]] and the split is preceded by the "pregeneration" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion.The developing organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion.

[[Budding]] can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. ''[[Convolutriloba retrogemma]]'' an [[acoela|acoel]] flat worm).&lt;ref name=Akesson2001&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1046/j.1463-6395.2001.00084.x| issn = 1463-6395| volume = 82| issue = 3| pages = 231–239| last = Åkesson| first = Bertil|author2=Robert Gschwentner |author3=Jan Hendelberg |author4=Peter Ladurner |author5=Johann Müller |author6=Reinhard Rieger | title = Fission in ''Convolutriloba longifissura'': asexual reproduction in acoelous turbellarians revisited| journal = Acta Zoologica| accessdate = 2011-07-13| date = 2001-12-01| url = http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c719135/pdf/Akesson-Gschwentner-2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdrc.20135| issn = 1542-9768| volume = 84| issue = 4| pages = 257–264| last = Egger| first = Bernhard| title = Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky| journal = Birth Defects Research.

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

'''Plants in space''' is about [[plants]] in [[outer space]].&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt; In the late 20th and 21st century, plants were often taken into space in low Earth orbit to be grown in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment, sometimes called space gardens.&lt;ref name="Mizuna"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html NASA - Growing Plants and Vegetables in a Space Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacelife/topics/plants/index.html NASA - Plants in Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt; Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt; Usually the plants were part of studies or technical development to further develop space gardens or conduct science experiments.&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt; To date plants taken into space have had mostly scientific interest, with only limited contributions to the functionality of the spacecraft, however the Apollo [[Moon tree]] project was more or less forestry inspired mission and the trees part of a country's bicentennial celebration

The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity.&lt;ref name="root"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/tages.html NASA - Getting to The Root of Plant Growth Aboard The Space Station]&lt;/ref&gt; This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible [[space farming]] in hypo- and micro-gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and C. Pallud, (2010), Martian base agriculture: The effect of low gravity on water flow, nutrient cycles, and microbial biomass dynamic, Advances in Space Research 46, 1257-1265, doi:10.1016/j.asr.2010.07.012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and C.

NASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for long-term space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Crew Members Sample Leafy Greens Grown on Space Station |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/meals_ready_to_eat |website=NASA |access-date=23 January 2016 |first=Kristine |last=Rainey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, aboard ISS in one plant growth device, the 5th crop of [[Chinese cabbage]] (''Brassica rapa'') from it included an allotment for crew consumption, while the rest was saved for study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/cabbage-patch-fifth-crop-harvested-aboard-space-station|title=Cabbage Patch: Fifth Crop Harvested Aboard Space Station|last=Heiney|first=Anna|date=2017-02-17|work=NASA|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Japanese artist took images of flowers and bonsai tree in a near-space flight  using a balloon.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/flowers-in-space-azuma-makoto-exobiotanica/&lt;/reF&gt; An  early discussion of plants in space, were the trees on the brick moon space station, in the 1869 short story "[[The Brick Moon]]".&lt;reF&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Atlantic_Monthly/Volume_24/Number_146/The_Brick_Moon]&lt;/reF&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Learning About 'Veggie' at the NASA Social.jpg|thumb|Vegetable Production System for ISS being discussed]]
In the 2010s there was an increased desire for long-term space missions, which lead to desire for space-based plant production as food for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is vegetable production on the International Space Station in Earth orbit.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2010, 20 plant growth experiments had been conducted aboard the [[international Space Station]]..&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt;

Several experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are instinctual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamovitz|first1=Daniel|title=What a plant knows : a field guide to the senses|date=2012|publisher=Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-28873-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments have found that plants have the ability exhibit [[gravitropism]], even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jost|first1=Ann-Iren Kittang|last2=Hoson|first2=Takayuki|last3=Iversen|first3=Tor-Henning|title=The Utilization of Plant Facilities on the International Space Station—The Composition, Growth, and Development of Plant Cell Walls under Microgravity Conditions|journal=Plants|date=20 January 2015|volume=4|issue=1|pages=44–62|doi=10.3390/plants4010044|issn=2223-7747|pmc=4844336|pmid=27135317}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature [[greenhouse]], scientists aboard the [[International Space Station]] can investigate how plants react in variable-gravity conditions.The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study [[lentil]] seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driss-Ecole|first1=Dominique|last2=Legué|first2=Valérie|last3=Carnero-Diaz|first3=Eugénie|last4=Perbal|first4=Gérald|title=Gravisensitivity and automorphogenesis of lentil seedling roots grown on board the International Space Station|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=1 September 2008|volume=134|issue=1|pages=191–201|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01121.x|issn=1399-3054|pmid=18429941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific objectives|url=https://lensesinspace.wordpress.com/objectives-of-the-gravi-experiment-2/|website=Plants in space: GRAVI-2 experiment|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in a several gravity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A decade of plant biology in space|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-decade-biology-space.html|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the [[Canadian Space Agency]], for example, found that [[white spruce]] seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA - Advanced Plant Experiment - Canadian Space Agency 2|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/70.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized [[amyloplast]] distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rioux|first1=Danny|last2=Lagacé|first2=Marie|last3=Cohen|first3=Luchino Y.|last4=Beaulieu|first4=Jean|title=Variation in stem morphology and movement of amyloplasts in white spruce grown in the weightless environment of the International Space Station|journal=Life Sciences in Space Research|date=1 January 2015|volume=4|pages=67–78|doi=10.1016/j.lssr.2015.01.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221455241500005X|bibcode=2015LSSR....4...67R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early efforts===
The first organisms in space were "specially developed strains of seeds" launched to {{convert|134|km|mi|abbr=on}} on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched [[V-2 rocket]]. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were [[maize]] seeds launched on 30 July 1946. Soon followed [[rye]] and [[cotton]]. These early [[suborbital]] biological experiments were handled by [[Harvard University]] and the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and were concerned with [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] on living tissue.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space. A chronology and annotated bibliography through the year 1960 |journal=US Naval School of Aviation Medicine |volume=ONR TR ACR-64 |issue=AD0272581 |date=1962 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9288 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, 500 tree seeds ([[Loblolly pine]], [[Sycamore]], [[Liquidambar|Sweetgum]], [[Redwood]], and [[Douglas fir]]) were flown around the Moon on [[Apollo 14]]. These [[Moon trees]] were planted and grown with controls back on Earth where no changes were detected.

In 1982, the crew of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Salyut 7]] space station conducted an experiment, prepared by Lithuanian scientists ([[Alfonsas Merkys]] and others), and grew some [[Arabidopsis]] using Fiton-3 experimental micro-greenhouse apparatus, thus becoming the first plants to flower and produce seeds in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-species-of-plant-to-flower-in-space |title=First species of plant to flower in space |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasawatch.com/archives/2016/01/no-nasa-these-a.html |title=No NASA, These Are Not The First Plants To Flower In Space |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Skylab]] experiment studied the effects of gravity and light on [[rice]] plants.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch5.htm NASA SP-401 - Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SVET-2]] Space Greenhouse successfully achieved seed to seed plant growth in 1997 aboard space station ''[[Mir]]''.&lt;ref name=zvet&gt;[http://www.space.bas.bg/astro/Aerosp16/tania1.pdf T.Ivanova, et al. - First Successful Space Seed-to-Seed Plant Growth Experiment in the SVET-2 Space Greenhouse in 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bion 5]] carried ''[[Daucus carota]]'' and [[Bion 7]] carried [[maize]] (aka corn).

Plant research continued on the [[International Space Station]]. Biomass Production System was used on the ISS [[Expedition 4]]. The [[Vegetable Production System]] (Veggie) system was later used aboard [[ISS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Veggie.html NASA - VEGGIE]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants tested in Veggie before going into space included lettuce, Swiss chard, radishes, Chinese cabbage and peas.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie.html NASA - Station Investigation to Test Fresh Food Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; Red [[Romaine lettuce]] was grown in space on [[Expedition 40]] which were harvested when mature, frozen and tested back on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15206">'''Repeated Implantation failure (RIF)''' is the failure of the [[embryo]] to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]] onto the side of the [[uterus]] wall following [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]] treatment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Regularly, this happens at 6-7 days after conception and involves the embedding of the growing embryo into the mothers uterus and a connection being formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norwitz|first=Errol R.|last2=Schust|first2=Danny J.|last3=Fisher|first3=Susan J.|date=2001-11-08|title=Implantation and the Survival of Early Pregnancy|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=en|volume=345|issue=19|pages=1400–1408|doi=10.1056/nejmra000763|pmid=11794174|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A successful implantation can be determined by using an [[ultrasound]] to view the [[Gestational sac|sac]] which the baby grows in, inside the uterus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, the exact definition of RIF is debated. Recently the most commonly accepted definition is when a women under 40 has gone through 3 unsuccessful cycles of IVF, when in each cycle 4 good quality eggs have been transferred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polanski|first=Lukasz T.|last2=Baumgarten|first2=Miriam N.|last3=Quenby|first3=Siobhan|last4=Brosens|first4=Jan|last5=Campbell|first5=Bruce K.|last6=Raine-Fenning|first6=Nicholas J.|date=April 2014|title=What exactly do we mean by 'recurrent implantation failure'? A systematic review and opinion|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=28|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.12.006|pmid=24581986|issn=1472-6483}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Repeated implantation failure should not be confused with recurrent IVF failure. Recurrent IVF failure is a much more broad term and includes all repeated failures to get pregnant from IVF. Repeated implantation failure specifically refers to those failures due to unsuccessful implanting to the uterus wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

An unsuccessful implantation can be down to either problems with the mother or with the embryo. It is essential that the mother and embryo are able to communicate with each other during all stages of [[pregnancy]], and an absence of this communication can lead to an unsuccessful implantation and a further unsuccessful pregnancy &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Alex|last2=Laufer|first2=Neri|date=May 2012|title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S001502821200324X|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1039–1043|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010|pmid=22464086|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Contributing Maternal Factors ==
During implantation, the embryo must cross the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] layer of the maternal [[endometrium]] before invading and implanting in the [[Stroma (tissue)|stroma]] layer. Maternal factors, including congenital uterine abnormalities, [[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s, [[Endometrial polyp|endometrial polyps]], intrauterine adhesions, [[adenomyosis]], [[thrombophilia]] and [[Endometriosis|endometriosis,]] can reduce the chances of implantation and result in RIF&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Congenital Uterine Abnormalities ===
Congenital uterine abnormalities are irregularities in the uterus which occur during the mothers foetal development&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===[[Hox gene|Hox]] Genes ===
Two genes have been identified to assist in the development and receptivity of the uterus and endometrium, [[HOXA10-HOXA9|Hoxa10]] and [[HOXA11|Hoxa11]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salleh|first=Naguib|last2=Giribabu|first2=Nelli|date=2014|title=Leukemia inhibitory factor: roles in embryo implantation and in nonhormonal contraception|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|volume=2014|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2014/201514|issn=1537-744X|pmc=4131495|pmid=25152902}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hoxa10 has been shown to change the upper uterine segment into [[Fallopian tube|oviduct]]-like structures, creating a smaller uterus that appears normal. Embryo transfer into the lower uterine segment does not allow for implantation, so the Hoxa10 gene has multiple effects throughout the uterus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Hoxa11 mutations alter the endometrial gland development and reduce the secretion of [[Leukemia inhibitory factor|Leukaemia-Inhibitory factor]] (LIF) which is required for implantation&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.
[[File:Uterine Fibroids.png|thumb|203x203px|Uterine Fibroid ]]

=== Fibroids ===
[[Uterine fibroid|Fibroid]]s are [[Benign tumor|benign tumours]] found in the [[smooth muscle]] of the uterus, they are often asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain. They effect implantation rates by altering the shape and [[cytokine]] composition of the uterus. Removal of [[submucosa]]l fibroids has shown to increase implantation rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endometrial Polyps ===
[[Endometrial polyp]]s are benign tumours found in the endometrium which factor into female infertility. There has been limited research into if their removal increases the chances of implantation and pregnancy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Intrauterine Adhesions ===
Intrauterine adhesions ([[Asherman's syndrome|Asherman's Syndrome]]) occur from scar tissue within the uterus which cause the closure of part or all of the uterus. The [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] prevent embryos from implanting by reducing the surface area and decreasing the receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salma|first=Umme|last2=Xue|first2=Min|last3=Md Sayed|first3=Ali Sheikh|last4=Xu|first4=Dabao|date=2014|title=Efficacy of intrauterine device in the treatment of intrauterine adhesions|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|pages=1–15|doi=10.1155/2014/589296|issn=2314-6141|pmc=4165200|pmid=25254212}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Intrauterine adhesions normally occur after damage has been caused to the [[endometrium]], either through removal of unwanted pregnancies, [[miscarriage]], [[infection]], and surgical damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Thrombophilia ===
[[Thrombophilia]] is a condition which makes the blood more likely to clot and this increases [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] risk, meaning the individual is at higher risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[Stroke|strokes]] or [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Ming Y|last2=Moll|first2=Stephan|date=April 2015|title=Thrombophilia|journal=Vascular Medicine|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=193–196|doi=10.1177/1358863x15575769|pmid=25832606|issn=1358-863X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In pregnancy it can lead to a disruption in the flow of blood to the [[placenta]] and the uterus wall. This can lead to a decreased receptivity of the uterus wall for a pregnancy and can lead to a miscarriage further on. However, how significantly this contributes to RIF is not fully known but each case should be assessed on a personal basis by a clinician &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{None}}

== Embryonic Factors ==
[[File:Translocation.gif|thumb|Figure 1: The exchange of chromosomal segments between chromosomes 4 to 20. Since no segments are lost, this is a balanced translocation.]]
The successful implantation of an embryo not only relies on a receptive uterine environment in the mother but also on the quality of the embryo itself. Embryo quality and probability of implantation can be affected by maternal and paternal genetic abnormalities as well as [[zona pellucida]] dysfunction and poor [[embryo transfer]] technique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Male Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[File:Blastocyst - 2.png|thumb|Figure 2: The zona pellucida surrounds the blastocyst cavity that contains the inner cell mass.]]
The quality of the [[sperm]] that [[Fertilisation|fertilizes]] an egg is a key contributor to the overall quality of the embryo. Abnormalities in [[DNA fragmentation]] and chromosomal arrangements are the main source of genetic deviation in males that can affect embryo quality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simon |first=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri |date=2012-09-14 |title=Assessment and treatment of repeated implantation failure (RIF) |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1227–1239 |doi=10.1007/s10815-012-9861-4 |pmc=3510376 |pmid=22976427}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fragmentation occurs when the strands of DNA are separated to form two separate strands, this disrupts the genetic information that is coded in genes. Depending on the severity of the fragmentation, this can lead to the dysfunction of specific genes which may or may not be essential for embryo survival and in this case the initiation of implantation. DNA fragmentation can happen spontaneously in cells that undergo programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) where DNA is broken apart by enzymes called [[Endonuclease|endonucleases]]. However, since the male DNA isn't activated until around day 3 after fertilisation, it is often difficult to diagnose sperm genetic abnormalities because morphological studies could identify a good quality oocyte when initial transfer occurs, but due to DNA fragmentation in the sperm, the embryo will die after day 3 of growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Female Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[Oocyte]] quality is also a main contributor to overall embryo quality since it is the DNA of the oocyte that is mainly involved in the first 3 days of embryo growth following fertilization. A major source of genetic abnormalities are [[Chromosomal translocation|balanced translocations]] (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A translocation involves the exchange of segments of chromosomes that are not a homologous pair. In most cases, this leads to balanced translocations, in which no DNA is lost therefore is usually asymptomatic. However, as female gametes are formed, it is probable that 2/3 of embryos produced will have unbalanced translocations within their DNA if fertilised by sperm with a balanced translocation too. Translocation mutations can occur at any point during fertilization or even the first meiotic division that the oocyte undergoes during foetal life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zona Pellucida Dysfunction ===
The female egg (oocyte) is surrounded by a layer of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called the zona pellucida. Once fertilisation has occurred, this layer will harden to prevent further sperm entering and maintain the shape of the fertilized egg ([[zygote]]) as it divides to form a [[blastocyst]] (Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2012-05-01 |title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1039–1043 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010 |pmid=22464086 |last1=Simon |first1=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the [[inner cell mass]] -  the group of cells within the blastocyst that go on to form the embryo - starts to expand, [[lysin]] enzymes secreted by the inner cell mass will act on the zona pellucida and weaken the hardened structure. Eventually, this will cause the rupture of the zona pellucida, allowing the blastocyst to hatch and begin to implant into the uterine wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If the zona pellucida fails to thin in preparation for rupture, this will prevent the blastocyst from hatching and therefore be unable to implant, therefore this is a probable cause of repeated implantation failure (RIF). This is supported by a study which showed that implantation rates in women who received assisted zona pellucida hatching - use of synthetic chemical to artificially weaken the zona pellucida - increased.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Investigations ==
Women with RIF should undergo ovarian function testing to explore their levels of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|AMH]] and any other hormones or [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] counts which may indicate the overall behaviour of the [[ovarian reserve]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coughlan |first=C. |last2=Ledger |first2=W. |last3=Wang |first3=Q. |last4=Liu |first4=Fenghua |last5=Demirol |first5=Aygul |last6=Gurgan |first6=Timur |last7=Cutting |first7=R. |last8=Ong |first8=K. |last9=Sallam |first9=H. |date=January 2014 |title=Recurrent implantation failure: definition and management |journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=14–38 |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.08.011 |pmid=24269084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male partners may also be offered laboratory testing of sperm DNA integrity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the instance of genetic testing, [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] may be made available to couples with RIF to exclude the possibility of balanced chromosomal translocations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Margalioth |first=E. J. |last2=Ben-Chetrit |first2=A. |last3=Gal |first3=M. |last4=Eldar-Geva |first4=T. |date=December 2006 |title=Investigation and treatment of repeated implantation failure following IVF-ET |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=3036–3043 |doi=10.1093/humrep/del305 |pmid=16905766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound|Ultrasounds]] may be used to oversee the morphological growth and development of follicles throughout IVF treatment, in addition to assessing endometrial thickness. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Hysteroscopy]] is an essential part of investigating a couple’s RIF pathology and is used as a diagnostic tool to examine the [[cervical canal]] and [[uterine cavity]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Management ==
In depth reviews of the underlying causes of a couple's [[infertility]] should be undertaken with a qualified fertility specialist in order to make decisions regarding further management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modifiable risk factors include [[smoking]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol consumption]] and [[Body mass index|BMI]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women with RIF should be advised to abstain from both alcohol and smoking, and male partners may also consider cessation of smoking due to effects associated with weaker sperm counts and damage to sperm DNA and motility. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An ideal BMI target for women with RIF is between 19 and 29; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Obesity|obese]] women may consider structured weight-loss programmes and regular exercise over [[bariatric surgery]] due to potential [[folate]], [[iron]], [[vitamin B12]] and other nutritional deficiencies. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the  miracle leaf plant (''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''). The small plant in front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) tall. The concept of "individual" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]
'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].

In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.

==Asexual==
{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}
Asexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of "splitting" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.

Some species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].

Other ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some
[[reptile]]s,&lt;ref name="reptiles"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles &amp; Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986

It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.

==Sexual==
{{Main article|Sexual reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}} 
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating in midair flight]]
Sexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called "plus" and "minus" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 79, No. 3 (Sep. 30, 1938), pp. 411-434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more than two  "sexes", called [[syngen]]s.
Most [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" where recombination occurs freely.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Otto and D. B. Goldstein. "Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy". [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]. Vol 131 (1992): 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE. (1987) The molecular basis of the evolution of sex. ''Adv Genet.'' '''24''':323-370. Review. {{PMID|3324702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.

===Allogamy===
{{Main article|Allogamy}}
Allogamy is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)

===Autogamy===
{{main article|Autogamy}}
Self-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term "autogamy" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532–542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.

===Mitosis and meiosis===
[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].

'''Mitosis'''
The resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] --&gt;
'''Meiosis'''
The resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell. A [[diploid]] cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions ([[tetraploid]] to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four [[haploid]] cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.

==Same-sex==
In recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/timeline.htm |title=Timeline of same-sex procreation scientific developments |publisher=samesexprocreation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are [[female sperm]] and [[male egg]]s, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. "However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis."&lt;ref name="chicken sperm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9227893|title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads|publisher= | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x|volume=39|issue=3|date=June 1997|pages=267–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Washington Post |date=April 22, 2004 |title=Japanese scientists produce mice without using sperm |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wYQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6950,1352704&amp;dq=japanese+scientists+combine+two+mouse+eggs+to+produce+daughter+mice&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-father-necessary-as-mice-are-created-with-two-mothers-2vskf8w58|title=No father necessary as mice are created with two mothers|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|date=2018-10-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=2018-10-01|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
&lt;!--[[Reproductive strategy]], [[Reproduction strategy]] and [[Reproduction strategies]] redirect here--&gt;
{{further information|Modes of reproduction|Life history theory}}

There are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.

===Other types===
{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}
* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.
* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].
* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].

==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.

When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]] and Bernstein et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H., Bernstein C. and Michod R.E. (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19: 357-382 in ''DNA Repair'', Inna Kruman (Ed.), InTech (publisher) {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}}. Available online from [http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair intechopen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.

==Life without==
The existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].

Scientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12114528&amp;dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]&lt;br/&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no [[metabolism]] and can only [[self-replication|replicate]] with the assistance of a hijacked [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s metabolic machinery.

The production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A [[Synthetic Genomics|synthetic genome]] has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new ''[[M. mycoides]]'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1190719| pmid = 20488990| year = 2010| last1 = Gibson | first1 = D.| last2 = Glass | first2 = J.| last3 = Lartigue | first3 = C.| last4 = Noskov | first4 = V.| last5 = Chuang | first5 = R.| last6 = Algire | first6 = M.| last7 = Benders | first7 = G.| last8 = Montague | first8 = M.| last9 = Ma | first9 = L.| last10 = Moodie | first10 = M.

There is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic&lt;ref name="venter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984|title=Scientists Create First Synthetic Cell|author=Robert Lee Hotz|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term "synthetic bacterial cell" but they also clarify "...we do not consider this to be "creating life from scratch" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq |title=FAQ |author=Craig Venter Institute |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions".&lt;ref name="venter"/&gt; Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield "truly programmable organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = W. Wayte Gibbs | title = Synthetic Life | journal = Scientific American | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=synthetic-life| date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3214/01.html |title= NOVA: Artificial life |accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lottery principle==
Sexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of "winning" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham

}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

According to documents published in the [[Guantanamo Bay files leak]], the US military [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] believed that Aamer had led a unit of fighters in Afghanistan, including the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], while his family was paid a stipend by [[Osama bin Laden]].

Aamer has suffered decline in his mental and physical health over the years, as he participated in [[hunger strike]]s to protest his detention conditions, and was held in [[solitary confinement]] for much of the time.

==Family and personal life==
Aamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in [[Medina]] in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt; Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the [[Gulf War]], he worked as a translator for the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/11-years-in-guantanamo-without-trial-or-charges/|title = 11 years in Guantanamo without trial or charges|author = Phil Hirschkorn|date = March 31, 2013|access-date = November 1, 2015|publisher = [[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal [[residency (domicile)|residency]] in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Bbc050208&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4245517.stm "Calls to free Guantanamo father"], [[BBC]], 8 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

Aamer worked as an Arabic translator for [[London]] law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with [[immigration]] cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/shaker-aamer-guantanamos-last-british-detainee-1914791.html|title=Shaker Aamer: Guantanamo's last British detainee|work=The Independent|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aamer's family lived in [[Battersea]], South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from [[Mood disorder|depression]] and mental episodes since his arrest.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent5Jan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/9446170.Ten_years_in_custody_without_charge_for_Shaker_Aamer/|title=Ten years in custody without charge for Battersea's Shaker Aamer|work=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, "When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.' She is still waiting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cahalan, Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/obamas-uturn-on-guantanamo-seals-fate-of-lone-briton-6283796.html |title=Obama's U-turn on Guantanamo seals fate of lone Briton |work=The Independent|location=UK|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and allegations==
[[File:Abdul Shaker with Children.jpg|240px|right|thumb|

Aamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt; The [[Northern Alliance]] took him into custody in [[Jalalabad]] in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; They interrogated Aamer at [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] and transported him to Guantánamo on 14 February 2002.

According to [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a "recruiter, financier, and facilitator" for [[al-Qaeda]], based partly on spurious evidence given by the informant [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], a fellow detainee.&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt; The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in [[Tora Bora]] with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing.&lt;ref name="eluded-US-during-10-year-manhunt"/&gt; The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence [[Mabahith]] identified Aamer "as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Cobain|first2=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-shaker-aamer-british|title=Guantánamo Bay files: Shaker Aamer, inmate from Britain the US won't let go|date=24 April 2011|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior [[threat assessment]]s of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=13 Guantanamo Review Task Force Final Report], (p.&amp;nbsp;9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/last-brit-guantanamo-shaker-aamer-diagnosed-post-traumatic-stress-1443869|title=Last Brit in Guantanamo Shaker Aamer Diagnosed With Post Traumatic Stress|work=International Business Times UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attorney, Clive Stafford Smith of [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], said the evidence against his client "would not stand up in court." He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], whom American judges found to be "utterly incredible" and who was tortured and "promised all sorts of things."&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt;

The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheScotsman9Jan2012/&gt;  The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.&lt;ref name="GuardianTownsend20130420"/&gt;

==Aamer's allegations of being tortured in Bagram ==
In September 2009, [[Zachary Philip Katznelson|Zachary Katznelson]], a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of [[MI5]], the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt; He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt;

Aamer says that the "MI5" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/guantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5|title='MI5 agent left me alone with gun', says Guantánamo terror detainee|date=6 September 2009|author=Doward, Jamie|work=The Guardian|location=London|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2009%2Fsep%2F06%2Fguantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5&amp;date=2009-09-06|archivedate=6 September 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All I know is that I felt someone grab my head and start beating my head into the back wall – so hard that my head was bouncing.

==Guantanamo==
Aamer has been described as an unofficial [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a [[Guantánamo Bay hunger strikes|hunger strike in 2005]] in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the [[Geneva Convention]], allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914/&gt; His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.

In September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Spectacle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=486|title=Updates - Shaker Aamer|work=Spectacle|location=UK|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as "cruel" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is "falling apart at the seams."&lt;ref name="morningstaronline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependentJan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Carol |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/24/2560773/secret-guantanamo-cell-block-cost.html |title=Secret Guantánamo cell block cost nearly $700,000 – Guantánamo |work=Miami Herald |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison.&lt;ref name=Cnn060918&gt;

The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Habeas04cv2215-2006-09-19&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After President [[Barack Obama]] was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It "unanimously recommended" transfer of Aamer.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt; Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"&gt;Charles Savage and Steven Erlanger, "Guantánamo Release Ends Yearslong Battle", ''New York Times'', 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guantánamo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. "It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/last-briton-in-guantanamo-on-hunger-strike |title=Last Briton in Guantanamo on hunger strike |publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know – hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/5001740._Heartbreaking__moment_Shaker_Aamer_saw_first_photo_of_son/ |title='Heartbreaking' moment Shaker Aamer saw first photo of son |work=Your Local Guardian |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Omar Deghayes]], a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=485 |title='Spectacle Shaker Aamer |work= Spectacle |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===At Camp "No" on June 2006===
{{main|Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations}}
In an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included [[asphyxiation]] on 9 June 2006, the same day that [[Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations|three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo]]. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;

Describing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18&gt;

The law professor [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]] published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to "[[Camp No, Guantanamo|Camp No]]," a secret interrogation [[black site]] outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as "alarming" and wrote, "This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt; Colonel [[Michael Bumgarner]], the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/hbc-90006395 |title=The Official Response Begins| author=Horton, Scott |work=Harpers Magazine |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in [[Bagram]] or the events on 9 June 2006. He wrote: "American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt;

=== 2013 hunger strike and detention condition ===

In 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since February 15 and had lost 32 pounds.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; In previous hunger strikes guards [[force-fed]] him with tubes down his nose.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 "that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison."&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt;

=== 2014 motion for release ===
In 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is "gravely diminished,". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and "''even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery". His lawyers argued that both the [[Geneva Convention]] and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26933512|title=Bid to free last British resident held at Guantanamo|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/guantanamo-bay-british-detainee-shaker-aamer-ptsd-release|title=Guantánamo Bay: last British resident suffering from PTSD, lawyers say|author=Jon Swaine|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/04/last-former-english-resident-in-guantanamo-bay-requests-release-on-declining-health.php|title=JURIST - Guantanamo detainee requests release on declining health|work=jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

==UK release negotiations==
The United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guantánamo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British [[Citizenship|citizens]].  In August 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914&gt;

On 30 October 2015, Aamer was flown from Cuba, stepping on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to "get the hell out" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were "not allowed" in Islam, and went on to say that "you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people" in apparent reference to the [[murder of Lee Rigby]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/shaker-aamer-attacks-extremism-guantanamo-release

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. Régis; with a preface by [[Benjamin Ball (physician)|M. Benjamin Ball]]; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B. Weiner [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft638nb3db&amp;chunk.id=d0e13621&amp;toc.id=d0e13621&amp;brand=ucpress Nine: Mind and Body in the Clinic] in Rousseau, G.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5PRR9-8BcC Madness and Civilization], 1964/2001, p. 209. Also known (unabridged) as [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5Pyfip2P1gC History of Madness] 1961/2006, p. 372. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013). Family Estrangement. Encyclopedia of Social Work. Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents.DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, A. S. (2003).

[[Attachment in adults|Attachment relationships in adults]] can also involve feelings of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Content/Consumer_Updates/Adult_Attachment_Relationships.aspx AAMFT Consumer Update]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a [[rat race|socioeconomic race]], or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokach|first=Ami|title=Loneliness then and now: Reflections on social and emotional alienation in everyday life|journal=Current Psychology|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.1007/s12144-004-1006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview", ''Military History'', Weider History Group, Inc. Leesburg, VA, November 2012. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that "even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mokenhaupt, Brian, [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26372/esq0307essay/ "I Miss Iraq. I Miss My Gun. I Miss My War,"] ''Esquire,'' June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, Psychologist, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief'', October 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation.

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Langman's study of ''punk, porn, and resistance'' (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of [[Afrikaans]] [[extreme metal]].

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Sperm sorting''' is a means of choosing what type of [[sperm cell]] is to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the [[egg cell]]. Several conventional techniques of  [[density gradient centrifugation|centrifugation]] or [[swim-up]]. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed.

It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as [[sex selection]] in which spermatozoa are separated into [[X chromosome|X-]] (female) and [[Y chromosome|Y-]] (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.

== Methods ==

=== Conventional techniques ===
Several methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. [[Density gradient centrifugation]] (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia C.|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Pletscher|first3=Flurina|last4=Geyter|first4=Maria de|last5=Zhang|first5=Hong|last6=Geyter|first6=Christian de|title=Isolation of spermatozoa with low levels of fragmented DNA with the use of flow cytometry and sorting|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213006407|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=686–694.e4|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, so-called [[swim-up]] techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rappa|first=Kari L.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Harold F.|last3=Hakkarainen|first3=Gloria C.|last4=Anchan|first4=Raymond M.|last5=Mutter|first5=George L.|last6=Asghar|first6=Waseem|date=2016-09-01|title=Sperm processing for advanced reproductive technologies: Where are we today?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016300076|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=34|issue=5|pages=578–587|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paasch|first=Uwe|last2=Grunewald|first2=Sonja|last3=Glander|first3=Hans-Juergen|date=2007-01-01|title=Sperm selection in assisted reproductive techniques|journal=Society of Reproduction and Fertility Supplement|volume=65|pages=515–525|issn=1747-3403|pmid=17644989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow cytometry ===
[[Flow cytometry]] is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caroppo|first=Ettore|title=Sperm sorting for selection of healthy sperm: is it safe and useful?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007000|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=695–696|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.006|pmid=23809504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Geyter|first3=Christian de|title=Sorting of spermatozoa with flow cytometry|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007395|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.039|page=e15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger [[X chromosome]] (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller [[Y chromosome]] (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=L. A.|last2=Welch|first2=G. R.|last3=Rens|first3=W.|date=1999-01-01|title=The Beltsville sperm sexing technology: high-speed sperm sorting gives improved sperm output for in vitro fertilization and AI|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=77 Suppl 2|pages=213–220|issn=0021-8812|pmid=15526798|doi=10.2527/1999.77suppl_2213x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called ''[[Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology]]'' was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Garner DL, Seidel GE. History of commercializing sexed semen for cattle. Theriogenology 2008;69: 886-895.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called [[Hoechst 33342]] which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart.  As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa.  As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge).  The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel GE, Jr., Garner DL. Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa. Reproduction 2002;124: 733-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is [[magnetic-activated cell sorting]] (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using [[Antibody|antibodies]] to surface markers of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) such as [[annexin V]], coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying [[magnetic field]] to the sperm suspension.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Monica|last2=Sar-Shalom|first2=Valerie|last3=Sivira|first3=Yolisid Melendez|last4=Carreras|first4=Ramon|last5=Checa|first5=Miguel Angel|date=2013-03-07|title=Sperm selection using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) in assisted reproduction: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=479–485|doi=10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|issn=1058-0468|pmc=3644127}}&lt;/ref&gt; MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.

=== Other techniques ===
[[DNA damage]] in sperm cells may be detected by using [[Raman spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21982/page1/ Ranking sperm cells could improve the odds of in vitro fertilization.] By Courtney Humphries. TechnologyReview. Wednesday, January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Sperm undergoes a process of [[natural selection]] when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest [[Sperm motility|motility]] but also by other factors such as [[DNA integrity]], production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[Cell viability|viability]]. This selection is largely circumvented in case of [[in-vitro fertilization]] which leads to higher incidence of [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] associated with [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive techniques]]. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.

=== For general health ===
Conventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]]. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aitken|first=R. John|last2=Clarkson|first2=Jane S.|date=1988-11-12|title=Significance of Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidants in Defining the Efficacy of Sperm Preparation Techniques|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Andrology|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=367–376|doi=10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x|issn=1939-4640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Geyter|first=C.|last2=Bals-Pratsch|first2=M.|last3=Doeren|first3=M.|last4=Yeung|first4=C.

New flow-cytometry based techniques such as [[YO-PRO]] staining can discriminate [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, [[annexin V]] staining followed by [[Magnetic-activated cell sorting|MACS]] can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== For sex selection ===

==== In farming ====
Sperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female [[Calf|calves]] (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=D.|last2=Barcikowski|first2=S.|last3=de Graaf|first3=S.|last4=Garrels|first4=W.|last5=Grossfeld|first5=R.|last6=Klein|first6=S.|last7=Knabe|first7=W.|last8=Knorr|first8=C.|last9=Kues|first9=W.|date=2013-01-01|title=Sex selection of sperm in farm animals: status report and developmental prospects|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|volume=145|issue=1|pages=R15–30|doi=10.1530/REP-12-0151|issn=1741-7899|pmid=23148085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy [[milk production]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In humans ====
{{Further information|Sex selection#Ethical concerns}}Choosing the sex of children might help prevent [[Sex-linked inheritance|sex-associated heritable diseases]] such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchene muscular dystrophy]] or [[haemophilia]] in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of [[sex selection]]. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a [[Human sex ratio|sex-ratio imbalance]]. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalfoglou|first=A.L.|last2=Kammersell|first2=M.|last3=Philpott|first3=S.|last4=Dahl|first4=E.|title=Ethical arguments for and against sperm sorting for non-medical sex selection: a review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147264831200692X|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=26|issue=3|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early to mid-1980s, [[Glenn Spaulding]] was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5021244.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5021244&amp;RS=PN/5021244&lt;/ref&gt; Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook, M. V. Look, D. Pinkel, Flow sorting of X and Y chromosome-bearing spermatozoa into two populations. Gamete Research Volume 16, Issue1, pages 1-9, January 1987; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.1120160102/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where "sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails".&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook and M. V. Look, Flow cytometry of X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm for DNA using an improved preparation method and staining with Hoechst 33342. Gamete Research Volume 17, Issue 3, July 1987, Pages: 203–212; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.1120170303/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no country in the world which explicitly permits sex selection for non-medical purposes. There were 31 countries in 2009 which allowed sex selection in case of sex-linked disease risk or other medical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geneticsandsociety.org/downloads/200904_sex_selection_memo.pdf|title=Countries with laws or policies on sex selection|last=Darnovsky|first=Marcy|date=2009|website=|publisher=geneticsandsociety.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a [[clinical trial]]. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with [[sex linkage]] or having at least one child (for family balancing).&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;[http://www.microsort.net/ Genetics &amp; IVF Institute: MicroSort Clinical Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsort.com/?page_id=319|title=About Us {{!}} MicroSort International|last=ThemeFuse|website=www.microsort.com|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some "male" sperm among the "female" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for "female" and "male" spermatozoa, respectively.&lt;ref name="institute" /&gt;

[[Image:Sporic meiosis.svg|thumb|300px|Spores produced in a sporic life cycle.]]
[[Image:Brachythecium rutabulum on Populus x canadensis.jpg|thumb|300px|Fresh snow partially covers Rough-stalked Feather-moss ''([[Bryopsida|Brachythecium rutabulum]])'', growing on a [[thinning|thinned]] hybrid black poplar ''([[populus|Populus x canadensis]])''.

Inset shows the surrounding, black poplars growing on sandy [[loam]] on the bank of a [[bog pond|kolk]], with the detail area marked.]]

In [[biology]], a '''spore''' is a unit of [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] or [[asexual reproduction]] that may be adapted for [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of many [[plant]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/searchresults.html?cx=009557456284541951685%3A50nf_5tpvuq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=spore&amp;sa=Search Tree Of Life Web Project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial spore]]s are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. [[Myxozoa]]n spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.&lt;ref&gt;"Myxozoa." Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].

The spores of [[seed plant]]s, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.

==Definition==
The term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word σπορά ''spora'', meaning "[[seed]], sowing", related to σπόρος ''sporos'', "sowing," and σπείρειν ''speirein'', "to sow."

In common parlance, the difference between a "spore" and a "[[gamete]]" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.

The main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.

==Classification of spore-producing organisms==
===Plants===
[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. 

Heterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Isoëtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a "female" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a "male". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.

===Fungi===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are [[diploid]] cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.

==Classification of spores==
Spores can be classified in several ways:

===By spore-producing structure===
[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]
[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]
[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]
====Fungi====
In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular [[taxon]] of the [[fungi]].

===By origin during life cycle===
* '''Meiospores''': spores produced by [[meiosis]]; they are thus [[haploid]], and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of [[gametophyte]]s of [[seed plant]]s found in [[flower]]s ([[angiosperm]]s) or [[Conifer cone|cones]] ([[gymnosperm]]s), and the [[zoospore]]s produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''.
** '''[[Microspore]]s''': meiospores that give rise to a male [[gametophyte]], ([[pollen]] in seed plants).
** '''[[Megaspore]]s''' (or '''macrospores'''): meiospores that give rise to a female [[gametophyte]], (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the [[ovule]]).
* '''[[conidium|Mitospores]]''' (or '''conidia''', '''conidiospores'''): spores produced by [[mitosis]]; they are characteristic of [[Ascomycetes]]. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called "mitosporic fungi" or "anamorphic fungi", and are previously classified under the [[taxon]] [[Deuteromycota]] (See [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph]]).

===By mobility===
Spores can be differentiated by whether they can [[motility|move]] or not.
* '''[[Zoospore]]s''': mobile spores that move by means of one or more [[flagellum|flagella]], and can be found in some [[algae]] and [[fungi]].
* '''[[Aplanospore]]s''': immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella.
* '''[[Autospore]]s''': immobile spores that cannot develop flagella.
* '''[[Ballistospore]]s''': spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal [[fruiting body]] as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most [[basidiospore]]s are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus ''[[Pilobolus]]''.
* '''[[Statismospore]]s''': spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are [[puffball]]s.

==Anatomy==
Under high [[magnification]], spores can be categorized as either '''monolete spores''' or '''trilete spores'''. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.

==Dispersal==
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]

In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.&lt;ref name="Trail"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].&lt;ref name="Pringle et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].

In Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Lönnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.

In the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophylla | work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-262-55025-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|issn=1535-0096
}}(Retrieved from [[ProQuest|ABI/Inform]] Document ID: 347271391)&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/replicating-sugarscape
|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Gilbert
|first1=Nigel
|last2=Bankes
|first2=Steven
|year=2002

|volume=99
|issue=3
|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Myth of Male Power: Why Men are the Disposable Sex''''' is a 1993 book by [[Warren Farrell]], in which Farrell argues that the widespread perception of men having inordinate social and economic power is false, and that men are systematically disadvantaged in many ways.

Like [[Herb Goldberg]]'s ''The Hazards of Being Male'', Farrell's ''The Myth of Male Power'' is considered a standard of the [[men's movement]],&lt;ref name="Clatterbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|year=2000|title=Literature of the U.S. Men's Movements|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=25|issue=3|pages=883–94|jstor=3175420|doi=10.1086/495485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into several languages, including [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

In ''The Myth of Male Power'', Warren Farrell offered his first in-depth outline of the thesis he would eventually apply in his subsequent books—books on communication (''Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say''), parenting (''Father and Child Reunion''), and the workplace (''Why Men Earn More'').
 
As ''The Myth of Male Power's'' title implies, Farrell challenges the belief that men have the power by challenging the definition of power. Farrell defines power as "control over one's life." He writes that, "In the past, neither sex had power; both sexes had roles: women's role was [to] raise children; men's role was [to] raise money."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power'', (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), Chp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the examples that Farrell uses to illustrate male powerlessness is male-only [[Selective Service System#Who must register|draft registration]].  He writes that if any other single group (the examples he lists are [[Jews]], [[African-Americans]], and [[women]]) were selected based on their birth characteristics to be the only group required by law to register for potential death, we would call it [[anti-Semitism]], [[racism]] or genocidal [[sexism]]. Men, he says, have been socialized to call it "glory" and "power," and as a result do not view this as a negative.

Farrell contends that this viewpoint creates psychological problems for both sexes: that "men's weakness is their facade of strength; women's strength is their facade of weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power'', (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), Chapter 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds that societies have generally socialized boys and men to define power as, in essence, "feeling obligated to earn money someone else spends while we die sooner." Feeling obligated, he contends, is not power.&lt;ref&gt;This critique of Farrell is part of feminist James Sterba's critique of ''The Myth of Male Power'' and ''Why Men Earn More'' in Oxford University Press' book, ''Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), which is a debate of thirteen gender issues between James Sterba, representing feminist theory, and Warren Farrell, articulating gender transition theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Why Men are the Disposable Sex"===
The subtitle of the book is "Why Men are the Disposable Sex." Farrell argues that historically both sexes were disposable in the service of survival: women risked death in childbirth; men risked death in war. However, Farrell notes, there is a key difference: women's disposability emanated more from biology; [[male expendability|men's expendability]] required socialization.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell observes various characteristics of modern US society, such as the tendency to assign higher-risk jobs - soldier, firefighter, coal miner, and so on - to men: almost all of the most hazardous professions are all-male, and segments within professions have higher percentages of men as their level of hazard increases. Other statistics, in conjunction with the lack of public outcry or mobilization around them, point in the same direction of male expendability. Men are victims of violent crime twice as often as women and are "three times more likely to be murder victims". Suicide rates are much higher for men than for women. While the death rates for breast cancer and prostate cancer are comparable, the US spends six times as much on breast cancer.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

These statistics, Farrell suggests, can only be explained if US society places greater value on the lives of women than of men. Todd Jones cites this as an example of [[abductive reasoning]]: rightly or wrongly, Farrell assumes that such behavior is rational, and the only explanation then is that "women are actually perceived as the valuable gender (especially in evolutionary terms) who need to be protected and preserved at all cost, while men (a dime a dozen in evolutionary terms) are thought of as essentially disposable".&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Todd|year=2004|title=Uncovering 'Cultural Meaning': Problems and Solutions|journal=[[Behavior and Philosophy]]|volume=32|issue=2|pages=246–68|jstor=27759484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Where Do We Go From Here?"===

Farrell posits that men and women need to make an evolutionary shift from a focus on survival to a focus on a proper balance between survival and fulfillment.

He claims that the women's movement has led to the re-socialization of girls to become women who balance survival with fulfillment but that there has been no similar re-socialization of boys to become men who pursue that balance once they take on the responsibility of children. Thus, Farrell believes, boys and men are decades behind girls and women psychologically and socially, and increasingly behind women academically and economically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitehouseboystomen.com/blog/?page_id=44, especially Components 1 and 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Farrell's recent presentations on this topic, he estimates that men are in 2011 where women were in 1961.&lt;ref name="warrenfarrell1"&gt;[http://warrenfarrell.com/articles.php?id=81 (text of a presentation from the Dec. 2010 Integral Spiritual Experience).] |dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901232702/http://warrenfarrell.com/articles.php?id=81#&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell's political solution is "neither a women's movement blaming men nor a men's movement blaming women, but a gender transition movement." He defines a gender transition movement as one that fosters a transition from the rigid roles of our past to more flexible roles for the future.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power, (N.Y.: Simon and Schuster, 1993), Personal Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Pay Paradox"===
Men, Farrell posits, learn to earn money to gain the approval of their parents and the respect of other men; heterosexual men also learn to earn money to earn their way to female love ("Women don't marry men reading ''Why Men Are the Way They Are'' in the unemployment line.")&lt;ref name="warrenfarrell1"/&gt;

Farrell introduced in ''The Myth of Male Power'' a thesis that he pursued in-depth in ''Why Men Earn More'' in 2005: that earning money involves forfeiting power.  He goes on to describe his theory that earning money is less about power, and more about trade-offs. Farrell proposes that "the road to high pay is a toll road--you earn more when you pay 25 specific tolls such as working more hours, or taking less-fulfilling or more-hazardous jobs..."&lt;ref&gt;''Why Men Earn More'', Dr. Warren Farrell, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical responses==
Academic [[Kenneth Clatterbaugh]], in an overview of literature of the [[men's movement]], comments that "eventually, [Farrell's] arguments reach absurd heights, as when Farrell actually argues against sexual harassment laws and child molestation laws on the grounds that they give even more power (to abuse men) to (women) employees and children".&lt;ref name="Clatterbaugh"/&gt;

Social critic [[Camille Paglia]], writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', sais ''The Myth of Male Power'' "attacks the unexamined assumptions of feminist discourse with shocking candor and forces us to see our everyday world from a fresh perspective", though she added that Farrell is sometimes guilty of "questionable selectiveness or credulity about historical sources". Paglia nevertheless concludes that the book "is the kind of original, abrasive, heretical text that is desperately needed to restore fairness and balance to the present ideology-sodden curriculum of women's studies courses."&lt;ref name=Paglia&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenging The Masculine Mystique|author=[[Camille Paglia]]|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer [[Robert Winder]] describes the book as "shock-horror hyperbole posing as scholarship" and goes on to write "...Farrell might be right to see the gender conflict as a war to which only one side has turned up, but this is only a sarcastic way of confessing to an authentic male worry: the twinge of jealousy men sometimes feel when confronted by feminine solidarity. Farrell, however, just like some of his female opposite numbers, prefers accusation to self-examination".&lt;ref name ="winder"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Winder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/book-review--hapless-underdogs-in-a-bitchy-world-the-myth-of-male-power--warren-farrell-4th-estate-699-1428367.html |title=BOOK REVIEW / Hapless underdogs in a bitchy world: 'The Myth of Male Power' - Warren Farrell: 4th Estate, 6.99 - Voices |publisher=The Independent |date=1994-03-11 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Mealey]] notes that the book is recommended reading for educators in the social sciences, particularly gender studies; she does critique Farrell, for easily seeing causality in correlation.&lt;ref name ="mealey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mealey|first=Linda|year=1995|title=Rev. of Goldberg, ''Why Men Rule''; and Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power''|journal=[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]|volume=14|issue=2|pages=284–85|jstor=4236163 .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Margot Mifflin]], writes that "most of Farrell’s tit-for-tat theories about man’s greater societal burden are slanted, self-serving, and absurdly simplistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margot Mifflin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20295161,00.html |title=The Myth of Male Power Review &amp;#124; Book Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=1993-08-27 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Melvin Konner]] writes that, like [[Christina Hoff Sommers]]' ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994), ''The Myth of Male Power'' is a good antidote to the way in which "real knowledge about sex roles...tends to get buried in [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] rhetoric."&lt;ref name ="konner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Konner, Melvin |title=The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=501 |isbn=0-7167-4602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Times]] notes that "...some critics say 'The Myth of Male Power' goes beyond the nurturing rituals of the male movement to mount an outright assault on the victories of the modern women's movement."&lt;ref name="WARRICK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-09/news/vw-22148_1_feminist-warren-farrell|title=A New Role for Men: Victim : Former feminist Warren Farrell says he's sick and tired of guys getting bashed. 'Male power,' he proclaims, is just a myth.|last=WARRICK|first=PAMELA|date=August 9, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] notes that the book "...has spawned a network of activists and sites that take Farrell’s ideology in a disturbing direction."&lt;ref name="MJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/warren-farrell-mens-rights-movement-feminism-misogyny-trolls/|title=Mad Men: Inside the Men’s Rights Movement—and the Army of Misogynists and Trolls It Spawned|last=Blake|first=Mariah|date=January 2015|work=motherjones.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes several factual errors concerning murderer [[Laurie Dann]], who is used as an example of violence against men by women. Farrell states that all of her victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist.&lt;ref name ="farrell"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Farrell  | first =Warren  | authorlink =  | title =The Myth of Male Power  | publisher =Berkley Books  | year =1993  | location =New York  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-425-18144-7  | page =216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[men's rights]] activists,&lt;ref name ="equal"&gt;{{cite web  | author = Equal Parents of Canada   | title  = Brief to the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access   | publisher =  | date =1998-03-31  | url =http://pages.interlog.com/~parental/committe/brief.htm#Farrell  | accessdate =2007-02-16  }}&lt;/ref&gt; academics,&lt;ref name ="fekete"&gt;{{cite book  | last  = Fekete  | first = John  | title = Moral Panic:Biopolitics rising  | publisher =Robert Davies Publishing  | year =1994  | location =  | isbn = 978-1-895854-09-1 | pages =31, 339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and media figures have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion.&lt;ref name ="raeside"&gt;{{cite news  | title =Corrections and Clarifications: Peter Raeside takes a look at the views of 'men's liberationist' Warren Farrell  | work=[[The Globe and Mail]]  | date =1993-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="kay"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Kay  | first =Barbara  | title =The last white ribbon  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[National Post]]  | date =2007-12-05  | url=http://www.barbarakay.ca/articles/view/101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.&lt;ref name ="warrenfarrell"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of Male Power|url=http://warrenfarrell.org/Resources/index.html|accessdate=2011-03-22|quote= "While Laurie Dann did go into a boys' bathroom and not a girls' bathroom, and tried to kill the boys for whom she was a babysitter, the Chicago Tribune on May 21, 1988, Section 1, does list two women who were direct victims of Laurie Dann, and a mother who was an indirect victim when she tried to rescue her two sons who had been taken to a basement by Laurie Dann who immediately lit a fire in the basement. Therefore my suggestion that she was a parallel force to the celebrated University of Montreal killer who focused on women, was not accurate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wereworms''' were  [[mythical]] creatures in [[Middle-earth]]. In the stories of [[hobbits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tolkien English Glossary A Guide to Old Uncommon and Archaic Words Used in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557255788|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}} the were-worms were supposedly terrible monsters that made their home in the Last Desert very [[Rhûn|far east]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]].
In the tales of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Wereworms were likened to [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]  and serpents. To Hobbits they were memories of creatures that stalked the Earth during the [[Wars of Beleriand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopaedia | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1991 | isbn=9780684839790|page=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early drafts of the book, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] had associated these wereworms with the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Modern Folklore | author=Robert B Durham | isbn=9781312909694}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Rateliff]]'s ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' links this reference to [[Mongolian death worm]]s.

==Adaptations==
These creatures appeared in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. Apparently they were used only for tunnelling, and not for fighting, because they did not take part in the ensuing battle.
They were thought to have tunnelled through the [[Misty Mountains]] and the Blue Mountains ([[Ered Luin]]), although tunnelling is known to be mostly the work of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]].
