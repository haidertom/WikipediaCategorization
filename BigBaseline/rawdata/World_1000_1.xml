'''Africa''' is the world's second largest and second most-populous [[continent]] (behind [[Asia]] in both categories). At about 30.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11.7 million square&amp;nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of [[Earth|Earth's]] total surface area and 20% of its land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley (1999), ''Africa'', Twenty-First Century Books. {{ISBN|0-7613-1367-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With
{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Africa}}|R}}/1e9 round 1}} billion people{{UN_Population|ref}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}, it accounts for about 16% of the world's [[human population]]. The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The continent includes [[Madagascar]] and various [[archipelagos]]. It contains 54 [[diplomatic recognition|fully recognised]] [[sovereign states]] ([[country|countries]]), nine [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and two ''[[de facto]]'' independent [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited or no recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa]].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the continent and its countries are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], with a substantial portion and number of countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Africa hosts a large diversity of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|ethnicities]], cultures and [[Languages of Africa|languages]]. In the [[New Imperialism|late 19th century]], European countries [[Scramble for Africa|colonised almost all of Africa]]; most present states in Africa originated from a process of [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the [[African Union]], which is headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Palazzo Ferreria statue 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue representing Africa at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the [[Nile]] river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich |encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch |date=1913–1918 |location=Hannover|edition=8th |url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015 |language=German|title=Afri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name seems to have originally referred to a [[Ancient Libya|native Libyan]] tribe, an ancestor of modern [[Berbers]]; see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''{{lang|phn|ʿafar}}'' meaning "dust",&lt;ref&gt;Venter &amp; Neuland, ''NEPAD and the African Renaissance'' (2005), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] word ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name="Michell"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, "The Berbers"], ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161–94.&lt;/ref&gt; The same word&lt;ref name=Michell/&gt; may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a Berber tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. {{ISBN|90-429-1344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, [[Carthage]] became the capital of the province it then named ''[[Africa Proconsularis]]'', following its defeat of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix ''[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]'' can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim region of [[Ifriqiya]], following its conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] Empire's ''[[Exarchate of Africa|Exarchatus Africae]]'', also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in his 7th-century ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title=Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed&lt;ref&gt;in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221–38.&lt;/ref&gt; linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East." Robert R. Stieglitz. ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (September 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ibn Khallikan]] and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarite]] king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called "Afrikus son of Abrahah" who subdued Ifriqiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cdLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|title=Kitab Wafayat Ala'yan.

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;million years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C.

After the evolution of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan van Sertima|van Sertima, Ivan]].

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Candice Goucher|author2=Linda Walton|title=World History: Journeys from Past to Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7cAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-72354-6|pages=2–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the [[Sahara]] has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Keenan|title=The Sahara: Past, Present and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUKPAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ice age]]s, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[Saharan rock art|rock art paintings]] depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] dating back perhaps 10 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercier|first1=Norbert|author2=et. al.|date=2012|title=OSL dating of quaternary deposits associated with the parietal art of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau (Central Sahara)|journal=Quaternary Geochronology|volume=10|pages=367–73|doi=10.1016/j.quageo.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht "Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060153/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht |date=2014-03-07 }}, ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, "Africa, 3rd Ed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011083356/http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm |date=2007-10-11 }} Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first [[Roman emperor]] native to North Africa was [[Septimius Severus]], born in [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was [[Punics|Punic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New exhibition about Roman Emperor Septimius Severus at the Yorkshire Museum|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/features/8826893.New_exhibition_about_Roman_Emperor_Septimius_Severus_at_the_Yorkshire_Museum/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Press|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]].

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift.

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt;was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|isbn=978-2-87747-563-1|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]] followed suit the next year (March 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Aryeetey|author2=Jane Harrigan|author3=Machiko Nissanke|title=Economic Reforms in Ghana: The Miracle and the Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87V55ZHppSYC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-844-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===

Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human migration|Migration]] from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At Least a Million Sub-Saharan Africans Moved to Europe Since 2010 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Plate is a major [[tectonic plate]] straddling the [[equator]] as well as the [[prime meridian]]. It includes much of the [[continent]] of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between {{Mya|60}} and {{Mya|10}}, the [[Somali Plate]] began [[rift (geology)|rifting]] from the African Plate along the [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropic ecozone]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html "Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193432/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html |date=2012-01-05 }} [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}
[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Mauritius beach.png|thumb|Tropical beach in [[Trou-aux-Biches]], [[Mauritius]]]]
Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and [[arable land]]. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"/&gt;

[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level – UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206051452/http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 |date=December 6, 2008 }}.

==Politics==
{{See also|List of political parties in Africa by country}}
There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

=== The African Union ===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Member states of the African Union&lt;!--no suspended states--&gt;]]

{{Main|African Union}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm |title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki |author=Thabo Mbeki |date=9 July 2002 |publisher=africa-union.org |location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa |accessdate=8 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210549/http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_%26_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union%2C%209%20July%202002.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/|title=Human Development Reports – United Nations Development Programme|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in Africa|Poverty]], illiteracy, [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of [[Poverty in Africa|the population living in poverty]] in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people).

Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries.  The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC).  The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa.  About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into dept.  A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia’s looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In a recently published analysis based on [[World Values Survey]] data, the Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] maintained that several African countries, most notably [[Ghana]], perform quite well on scales of mass support for [[democracy]] and the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3214715 |ssrn=3214715|title=Africa on the Maps of Global Values: Comparative Analyses, Based on Recent World Values Survey Data|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2018-07-16|last1=Tausch|first1=Arno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch's global value comparison based on the [[World Values Survey]] derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded “is really amazing”. While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in [[Ghana]], the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], and especially for Africa's leading economy, [[South Africa]]. High [[Human Inequality]], as measured by the [[UNDP]]’s [[Human Development Report]]’s [[Index of Human Inequality]], further impairs the development of [[Human Security]]. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and [[human rights]] data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a [[civil society]].

In recent years, the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 Malia Politzer, "China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration"], ''Migration Information Source''.

A Harvard University study led by professor [[Calestous Juma]] showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124337.htm "Africa Can Feed Itself in a Generation, Experts Say"], ''[[Science Daily]]'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

[[File:Kobli1.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from [[Benin]]]]
Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overpopulation.org/Africa.html|title=Africa Population Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx Past and future population of Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924044751/http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx |date=2015-09-24 }}.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and [[southeast Africa]]. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[the Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''. PUQ. p. 204. {{ISBN|2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ("[[Bushmen|San"]] or "Bushmen") and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

Prior to the [[decolonization]] movements of the post-[[World War II]] era, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] were represented in every part of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country" (3 of 10)]. ''Time'', 5 November 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million ''[[pieds-noir]]s'' in North Africa),&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994).

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name="Africa"/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, "Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce"], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Africa |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602050234/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D8048%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate= 2 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps the largest in the world.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoisan Languages|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Khoisan.html|website=The Language Gulper|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, English and French (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. German is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former German protectorate.

Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"&gt;[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf Pearsonhighered.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070358/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/&gt;

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[architecture of Africa|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known [[bead]]s were made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology'' (2013, {{ISBN|0191626147}}), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Africa}}
[[File:Ke-Nako Music-Performance Vienna2008c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A musician from [[South Africa]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab world|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
[[File:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Fifty-four African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

At {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=off}}, it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].

Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, [[protist]]a, and certain [[animal]]s, such as [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s. Vegetation, where it occurs, is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered, unseen until 1820 when the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' sighted the [[Fimbul ice shelf]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

Antarctica is a ''de facto'' [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] that have consulting status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.

==Etymology==
[[File:Adelie Penguins on iceberg.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguins]] in Antarctica]]
The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanised]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ἀνταρκτική (''antarktiké''), feminine of [[wikt:ἀνταρκτικός|ἀνταρκτικός]] (''antarktikós''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |editor-last=Crane |editor-first=Gregory R. |contribution=Antarktikos |title=A Greek–English Lexicon |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hince |first=Bernadette |date=2000 |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=978-0-9577471-1-1 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his book ''Meteorology'' about an ''Antarctic region'' in c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorologica.] Book II, Part 5. 350 BCE. Translated by E. Webster. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923. 140 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marinus of Tyre]] reportedly used the name in his unpreserved world map from the 2nd century CE.  The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] and [[Apuleius]] (1–2 centuries CE) used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name ''polus antarcticus,''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlWM1eMefB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage De astronomia.] Ed. G. Viré. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1992. 176 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apuleii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage Opera omnia.] Volumen tertium. London: Valpy, 1825. 544 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; from which derived the [[Old French]] ''pole antartike'' (modern ''pôle antarctique'') attested in 1270, and from there the [[Middle English]] ''pol antartik'' in a 1391 technical treatise by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (modern ''Antarctic Pole'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer. [http://art-bin.com/art/oastro.html A Treatise on the Astrolabe.] Approx. 1391. Ed. W. Skeat. London: N. Trübner, 1872. 188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called "[[France Antarctique]]".

The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name==
The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.

Then in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name ''Australia'' from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. During that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as Ultima and Antipodea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''Antarctica'' was adopted in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodburn |first1=Susan |title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica |journal=Cairt |date=July 2008 |issue=13 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no indigenous population, and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, in February 1775, during his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]], [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, belief in the existence of a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]—had prevailed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century AD. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy'']]

Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''—this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:

{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, Matthew.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it retains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

Positioned asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. There are a number of rivers and lakes in Antarctica, the longest river being the [[Onyx River|Onyx]]. The largest lake, [[Lake Vostok|Vostok]], is one of the largest sub-glacial lakes in the world. Antarctica covers more than {{convert|14|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; and is mostly characterised by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation coloured by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204205054/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]], the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the small possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geologic time scale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]]: see [[ice-sheet dynamics]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land|&lt;abbr title="Macpherson"&gt;Mac&lt;/abbr&gt;. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on [[Ross Island]] is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent, and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081129/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385|title=Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.&lt;ref name="Briggs2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=19 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm|title=Secret rivers found in Antarctic|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

===Geological history and palaeontology===
More than 170&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

====Palaeozoic era (540–250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&amp;nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&amp;nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-98665-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)====
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206–146&amp;nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146–66&amp;nbsp;Ma), though [[Nothofagus|southern beech]] became more prominent towards the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Glacialisaurus]]'', from the [[Hanson Formation]],&lt;ref name="SmithPol2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nathan D.|last2=Pol|first2=Diego|date=2007|title=Anatomy of a basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of Antarctica|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–674|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-657.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie, Mitch |title=The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080130062646/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |archivedate=30 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up.

However, there is some evidence of antarctic marine glaciation during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Bornemann, Norris RD, Friedrich O, Beckmann B, Schouten S, Damsté JS, Vogel J, Hofmann P, Wagner T., Isotopic evidence for glaciation during the Cretaceous supergreenhouse.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gondwana breakup (160–23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160&amp;nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125&amp;nbsp;Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reinhold, Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=Antarctica yields first land mammal fossil|journal=New York Times|date=21 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eocene]] epoch, about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.  During the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels have been found to be about 760 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|title=New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=26 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082838/http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.

Around 23 Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels became more important.&lt;ref name="DeContoPollard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeConto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

====Neogene Period (23–0.05 Ma)====
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Trewby|editor-first=Mary|date=September 2002|title=Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1-55297-590-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meyer Desert Formation biota====
{{main|Meyer Desert Formation biota}}
Fossil ''[[Nothofagus]]'' leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the [[Sirius Group]] show that intermittent warm periods allowed ''Nothofagus'' shrubs to cling to the [[Dominion Range]] as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late [[Pliocene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=New grounds for reassessing palaeoclimate of the Sirius Group |date=2001 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London |volume=158|pages=925–35 | doi=10.1144/0016-764901-030 | last1=Retallack | first1=G.J. | last2=Krull | first2=E.S. | last3=Bockheim | first3=J.G. | issue=6|bibcode=2001JGSoc.158..925R }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Pleistocene]] ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4164401.html |author= Stefi Weisburd |title=A forest grows in Antarctica.

===Present-day===
[[File:Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica by NASA.jpg|thumb|Glaciers and rock outcrops in Marie Byrd Land seen from NASA's [[DC-8]] aircraft]]
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by nearly all of the continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|title=Antarctica's geology|publisher=Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in partnership with the British Antarctic Survey and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=31 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122142909/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|archivedate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse" /&gt; The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002" /&gt; It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest of [[Earth]]'s continents.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|−80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|−89.2|C|F|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. [[Sunburn]] is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="BAS-weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt;

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun&amp;nbsp;– Aphelion and Perihelion]. Geography.about.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name="BAS-weather" /&gt;

Several governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a [[population density]] between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]]—[[Trinity Church (Antarctica)|Trinity Church]], opened in 2004 at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Station]]—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/flock_antarcticas_orthodox_temple_celebrates_holy_trinity_day|title=Flock of Antarctica's Orthodox temple celebrates Holy Trinity Day|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavye.org.ua/index.php?action=fullinfo&amp;r_type=&amp;id=22495|script-title=ru:Владимир Петраков: 'Антарктика – это особая атмосфера, где живут очень интересные люди'|language=ru}} (Vladimir Petrakov: "Antarctic is a special world, full of very interesting people").

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-521-25274-4|oclc=473919719|pages=12, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[southern rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregate in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as [[sea cucumbers]] and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution&amp;nbsp;– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport eggs and larval stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming.&lt;ref name="basplants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge, Paul D.|author2=Spooner, Brian M.|author3=Roberts, Peter J.|date=2008|title=Non-lichenized fungi from the Antarctic region|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=106|pages=485–490|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0106/0485.htm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[endolith|cryptoendoliths]] as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to [[UV light]]. Those features can also be observed in algae and [[cyanobacteria]], suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as ''[[Cryomyces antarcticus]]'', and ''[[Cryomyces minteri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackyeast2010.bf.uni-lj.si/fileadmin/userfiles/Lectures/Onofri.pdf|title=Survival of Black Fungi in Space, Preliminary Results|author=Onofri, S.|author2=Selbmann, L.|author3=Zucconi, L.|author4=Scalzi, G.|author5=Venkateswaran, K.J.|author6=de la Torre, R.|author7=de Vera, J.-P.|author8=Ott, S.|author9=Rabbow, E.|author10=Horneck, G.|last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Hoog, G.S.|date=2005|title=Fungi of the Antarctic: evolution under extreme conditions|journal=Studies in Mycology|volume=51|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
About 298 million years ago [[Permian]] forests started to cover the continent, and [[tundra]] vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|title=Antarctica was once green: Scientists|date=15 April 2017|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062932/https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s. There are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], but only three species of [[flowering plant]]s, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass), ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native ''[[Poa annua]]'' (annual bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247414000916|title=''Poa annua'' L. in the maritime Antarctic: an overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarzyna_Chwedorzewska/publication/270217066_Poa_annua_L._in_the_maritime_Antarctic_an_overview/links/54a30c080cf267bdb9042e47.pdf|journal=Polar Record |volume =51|issue =6 |date=2015|pages=637–643|author=Chwedorzewska, K.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="basplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115623/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|archivedate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aadplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|title=Antarctic Wildlife|author=Australian Antarctic Division|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190048/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===
[[File:Blood Falls by Peter Rejcek.jpg|thumb|right|Red fluid pours out of [[Blood Falls]] at [[Taylor Glacier]]. The colour derives from [[iron oxides]].]]
Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicoloured [[snow algae]] and [[diatom]]s are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.&lt;ref name="aadplants"/&gt; Bacteria have been found living in the cold and dark as deep as {{convert|800|m|mi ft|abbr=on}} under the ice.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130206"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman|first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html|date=6 February 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
[[File:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|left|Dumping of waste, including old vehicles, such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992, is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998.]]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of [[biodiversity]] in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.&lt;ref name="BridgeHughes73"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridge|first1=Paul D.|first2=Kevin. A.|last2=Hughes|date=2010|title=Conservation issues for Antarctic fungi|journal=Mycologia Balcanica|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–76|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59687/0007/001/0073.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of [[introduced species|alien]] plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of [[krill]], which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (35,300&amp;nbsp;short tons) in 2000.&lt;ref name="KirbyBBC-2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=15 August 2001|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined [[Queen Maud Land]] as including the unclaimed area between it and the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapp|first1=Ole Magnus|title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen|journal=[[Aftenposten]]|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-8168779.html|accessdate=22 September 2015|date=21 September 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|language=no|quote=...&amp;nbsp;formålet med anneksjonen var å legge under seg det landet som til nå ligger herreløst og som ingen andre enn nordmenn har kartlagt og gransket.

Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e|title=Antarctic Treaty System – Parties|publisher=Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat|accessdate=20 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] named a previously unnamed area [[Queen Elizabeth Land]] in tribute to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foreign Secretary has announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land|work=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]], was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.&lt;ref name="BBC News: Argentine Protest Against Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina angry after Antarctic territory named after Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20822582|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby [[Falkland Islands]], and the 30th anniversary of the [[Falklands War]].

The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of the Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.&lt;ref name="peecug1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |title=La Antartica |publisher=Library.jid.org |accessdate=4 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007084832/http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peecug2"&gt;[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092226/http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

==Economy==

There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Resources|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2111.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries News|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2003/11/30/fisheries-news|publisher=mecropress|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships; 38,478 were recorded in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=2 August 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034540/http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |archivedate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=5 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iaato.org/documents/10157/1444539/2015-2016+Tourists+by+Nationality+(Total)/9a4fe29b-1c44-45cc-96b2-246e93137b2f|title=2015–2016 Tourists by Nationality Total|publisher=IAATO|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html|title=''Tourism threatens Antarctic''|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=5 February 2006|location=London|first=Mark|last=Rowe|date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[biologist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[Ice-sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen–Scott station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |title=Science in Antarctica |publisher=Antarctic Connection |accessdate=4 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207003148/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref name=adelie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|title=Adelie Penguins thriving amid Antarctica's melting ice|author=Graham, Rex|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053724/https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[The Polar Geospatial Center]] was founded.  The Polar Geospatial Center uses [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to provide mapping services to American federally funded research teams.  Currently, the Polar Geospatial Center can image all of Antarctica at 50&amp;nbsp;cm resolution every 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/polar-geospatial-center-releases-new-application-with-high-res-satelli/370342|title=Polar Geospatial Center Releases New Application with High-Res Satellite Imagery|author=Rejcek, Peter|publisher=The Antarctic Sun|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&amp;nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of the [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s. Belgian polar explorer [[Alain Hubert]] stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in [[climatology]], [[glaciology]] and [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belspo.be/belspo/bepoles/science/station/index_en.stm Belgian Science Policy Office]&amp;nbsp;– Princess Elisabeth Station&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and [[David Vaughan (glaciologist)|David Vaughan]], reported (in the journal ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'') that 2,200 years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on [[aerial survey|airborne survey]] with radar images).

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.&lt;ref name="meteorite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name="meteorite"/&gt;

In 2006 a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="crater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |title=Big Bang in Antarctica—Killer Crater Found Under Ice |publisher=Research News |first=Pam Frost |last=Gorder |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 reports emerged of a {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf#Supposed meteor crater|circular structure]], supposedly a meteorite crater, on the surface snow of [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf]]. Satellite images from 25 years ago seemingly show it.

[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|upright=1.35|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation except along the southern summer. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.&lt;ref name="United Nations Environment Programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.&lt;ref name="RignotCasassa2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.

Sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183–1189 | date = 2012-11-30 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | pages = 219–222 | date = 2018-06-13 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.&lt;ref name="landice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single 2015 study by H. Jay Zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year.&lt;ref name="ZwallyEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H.

Eric Rignot, who has worked on similar Antarctic studies, has been fielding a lot of questions about this one and shared his comments with Ars. “I am afraid I have some rather harsh words about it,” he wrote. Rignot said the data just aren’t precise enough to support the paper's conclusions.¶ “Zwally's group is the only one pushing its interpretation beyond the realm of the inherent uncertainty of the data. Accumulation of snow in East Antarctica is 10 centimeters water equivalent per year. To detect changes in accumulation of 136 gigatons (with no error bar), or 10 percent, Zwally et al. needs to detect changes of the order of 1 centimeter. Current technology such as ICESat cannot detect any change smaller than 20 centimeters. Radar altimetry (used for the earlier period) is closer to 40-50 centimeter noise, but nobody really knows. There is no way to detect changes in East Antarctic accumulation at the 10 percent level, not even 50 percent level, with those kinds of error bars,” Rignot wrote.¶ He continued, “The Zwally group’s findings are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.&lt;ref name="ShepherdWingham2007"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1136776| last1 = Shepherd | first1 = A.| last2 = Wingham | first2 = D.| title = Recent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 315| issue = 5818| pages = 1529–1532| date = 2007| pmid = 17363663|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1529S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.L.| last3 = Van Den Broeke | first3 = M R.| last4 = Davis | first4 = C.| last5 = Li | first5 = Y.| last6 = Van De Berg | first6 = W.J.| last7 = Van Meijgaard | first7 = E.| date = 2008| title = Recent Antarctic ice mass loss from radar interferometry and regional climate modelling| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 106| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232802727_Recent_Antarctic_ice_mass_loss_from_radar_interferometry_and_regional_climate_modelling|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..106R | pmc = 4032514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherdetal2012"&gt;Sheperd et al. 2012 [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance]&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.L.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = C.R.| last3 = Tapley | first3 = B.D.| last4 = Blankenship | first4 = D.| last5 = Young | first5 = D.| date = 2008| title = Antarctic regional ice loss rates from GRACE| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 266| issue = 1–2| pages = 140–148|bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.266..140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006.

==Ozone depletion==
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|Image of the largest Antarctic [[ozone hole]] ever recorded due to [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] accumulation (September 2006)]]
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

There is a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|authors=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit |publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole was detected by scientists in 1985&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792–795|accessdate=7 October 2009|issue=7257|pmid=19675624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=The Antarctic Ozone hole |authors=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) |publisher=Government of the United States |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |archivedate= 3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&amp;nbsp;°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subject coverage also includes [[biodiversity]], [[pest control]], [[environmental pollution]], [[animal disease]] (including [[zoonotic disease]]s), [[nutrition]], and [[food production]]. [[Natural resource management]] includes plant and [[animal breeding]]. CAB Abstracts Archive is also  indexed in other databases, which also serve as access points. These other databases are ''CAB Direct'', [[Web of Knowledge]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Ovid Technologies|OvidSP]], and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]].

The following print journals (digitized) comprise CAB Abstracts Archive:

===Global Health Archive===
'''''Global Health Archive''''' is a searchable database produced by CABI. It is created from 800,000 records, from six printed abstract journals,  which are collected published scientific research from 1910 to 1972, digitized to form the archive. Global Health Archive is also  indexed in other databases, which also serve as access points. These other databases are ''CAB Direct'', [[Web of Knowledge]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Ovid Technologies|OvidSP]], and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]].&lt;ref name=ghArchive/&gt;

When combined with the ''Global Health'' database indexing coverage can be from 1910 to present day. Hence, coverage is made up of past [[epidemics]], from rates and patterns of disease [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], duration of [[pandemics]], timing of epidemiological peaks, [[geographic distribution]] of diseases, and [[World Health Organization|government preparedness]] and [[quarantine]] provisions.  The following can also be taken  into account:  effects on different age and [[social groups]], severity in developing vs. developed countries, [[symptoms]], causes of [[Human|mortality]] - such as secondary problems like [[pneumonia]] - and mortality rates.&lt;ref name=ghArchive&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9499">The '''Countess of Dufferin Fund''' was established by [[Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava]], more commonly known as Lady Dufferin, in 1885 and was dedicated to improving women’s healthcare in [[India]].  The Fund was founded after [[Queen Victoria]] gave Lady Dufferin the task of improving healthcare for women in India.  The Fund provided scholarships for women to be educated in the medical field as doctors, hospital assistants, nurses, and [[midwives]].  It also financed the construction of female hospitals, dispensaries, and female only wards in preexisting hospitals.  The Fund marks the beginning of Western medicine for women in India and global health as a diplomatic concern.

== History of the Fund ==

=== Background ===

During the 19th century there was a major push in India to improve healthcare for women, especially maternal health.  [[Lying-in]] hospitals were built as well as training and teaching hospitals.  Many hospitals were also constructing wards for women and learning to treat female-specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;Abraham, Meera. Religion, Caste, and Gender: Missionaries and Nursing History in South India. Bangalore: B.I. Publications Pvt., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===

In 1885, Lady Dufferin set up the Fund after being contacted by Queen Victoria who gave her the task of helping the suffering women of India.  Queen Victoria had been recently contacted by [[Elizabeth Bielby]], a missionary in India who focused on women’s health.  During Beilby’s mission, she had treated the Maharani of Puna who gave her a message to relay to the Queen of England.  The message said that “the women of India suffer when they are sick.”  In response, Queen Victoria wrote back to the Maharani saying: {{quotation|“We had no idea it was as bad as this.  Something must be done for the poor creatures.  We wish it generally known that we sympathize with every effort to relieve the suffering of the women of India.”&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;}}  Lady Dufferin then started the Fund after being summoned to [[Windsor Castle]] by the Queen who gave her the task of improving healthcare and education for the women of India.&lt;ref name=Nightengale&gt;Nightingale, Florence. "The Condition of Women in India." Florence Nightingale on Social Change in India. Ed. Lynn McDonald and Gérard Vallée. Waterloo, Ont.: Wilfrid Laurier UP, 2007. 717-21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A visit from Dr. [[Mary Scharlieb]], the first female British doctor to practice in India, also mobilized the Queen to act on women’s poor health and suffering in India.  She met with Queen Victoria and expressed a similar message as the Maharni’s: the dire situation of Indian women.

=== Establishment ===

Lady Dufferin established the Fund in 1885 and immediately began creating projects and channeling money towards women’s health and teaching in India.  The Countess of Dufferin Fund is also known as “The National Association for Supplying Medical Aid to the Women of India” and the “Lady Dufferin Fund.”  This Fund marked one of the first diplomatic pushes to improve global health in the world, and the introduction of western medicine for women in India.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, Geraldine Hancock. Women in Colonial India: Essays on Politics, Medicine, and Historiography. N.p.: Orient Blackswan, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund’s goals ==

The Fund had three primary goals: providing medical tuition, medical relief, and female nurses and midwives to assist in hospitals and private homes.&lt;ref name=Billington&gt;
Billington, Mary Frances.'' Woman in India''. Delhi, India: Sri Satguru Publications, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund supplied scholarships for the medical education (medical tuition) of women in India.  The education of traditional Indian midwives, called dias, was a major goal of the Fund because many western doctors observed the dais’s practices and found their traditions to be harmful.&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;Guha, Supriya, Dr. "Midwifery in Colonial India." Welcome History. N.p., 13 Mar. 2012. Web. 15 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dais’s would massage the abdomen of the mother to speed up labor however that tradition caused [[uterine prolapse]], a widespread issue amongst Indian women at the time.  Because the dias’ methods were viewed as violent and extremely harmful, the Fund put forth money to educate them on successful ways to help women before, during, and after childbirth.  The Fund also provided medical relief by establishing dispensaries and cottage hospitals for women and children under female superintendence.&lt;ref name=Billington/&gt;  In addition, it opened female wards in existing hospitals also under female management as well as all women hospitals called [[zenana missions|zenana]] hospitals.  The Fund also supplied trained female nurses and midwives in hospitals and in private homes.

== Projects ==

The Fund financed treatment and teaching hospitals in [[Bihar]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Karachi]], [[Delhi]], [[Bombay]] and in many of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (roughly present day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand).&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt; Most notably, the Fund sponsored the [[Lady Aitchison Hospital]] in [[Lahore]], India.&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;  The Lady Aitchison Hospital, also known as the Aitchison Memorial Hospital, was a major center for training nurses and tradition midwives like the dias.  Many of the hospitals the Fund financed are still functioning today.  For example, the [[Lady Dufferin Hospital]] in Karachi is the largest solely female dedicated hospital today in Pakistan.

== Funding and Administration ==

The Fund’s major financial basis was donations.  Many saw this as a source of instability because donations were based on the popularity of Lady Dufferin and her husband as well as the favors expected by the donors in return.  The administration of the Fund consisted of a central committee of members of the Viceroy’s Council and Home Department.  It also included many influential Englishmen and Indians such as the Maharja Sir Jotendro Mohun Tagore, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and Sir [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]].&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

== Criticism of the Fund ==

There were three major criticisms of the Fund: its teaching, effectiveness, and integrity.  Many believed the Fund was inefficient.  Some argued that they inadequately taught doctors and employed subpar medical practitioners.&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;Conrad, Lawrence I., and Anne Hardy. "Western Feminism, Western Medicine, and Colonial Medical Practice." Women and Modern Medicine. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001. 42-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 1908, only 43 completely qualified women medical professionals were working under the Fund however only 11 held university degrees.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, Kathleen O. "The Countess of Dufferin's Fund." The British Medical Journal (1908): 1219-220. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Journal]] wrote in 1908 that, “The Government appears to have a perfect delight in swamping the country with unqualified medical practitioners."&lt;ref name=Vaughan/&gt;  The Fund was also criticized as ineffective for placing male doctors in Zenana hospitals.  Zenana women’s traditions forbade them from seeing, so they could be treated by the doctors the Fund provided.  In addition, the Fund was also criticized for not giving the women they were educating enough reason to stay with learning medicine.  The Fund paid for their education however their salaries were not high enough so it made more financial sense for the women to marry before they could give back to the hospital that educated them.  The Fund set up this cycle of educating women who would then work for them, however, it was ineffective in some cases because the women would not stick with the medical profession for financial reasons.  Because of the many criticisms of ineffectiveness, some of the Fund’s highest critics like The British Medical Journal called for a reorganization of the Fund.  Some also believed vanity, not philanthropy, was the source of motivation for establishing the Fund.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;  They criticized both Lady Dufferin for starting the Fund for her personal image and Queen Victoria for supporting the Fund for Britain’s international image.

== After Lady Dufferin ==

The Fund continued even after Lady Dufferin’s term ended.  Lady Lansdowne, who succeeded Lady Dufferin, continued to put work into the Fund which was passed down from vicereine to vicereine until 1947.&lt;ref name=Nightengale/&gt;  In 1947, India gained independence from Great Britain and the Fund was taken over by the Central Indian Government by the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957.  Once the Fund was taken over by the Central Government, it became obsolete.  In 2005 a bill was passed repealing the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957, for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name=GOVERNMENT&gt;"GOVERNMENT BILLS: Discussion On The Countess Of Dufferin'S Fund ... on 5 December 2002."

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?"

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001. Social ecosystem health: confronting the complexity and emergence of infectious diseases.

&lt;ref&gt;Levins, R. and Lopez C. "Toward an ecosocial view of health", ''International Journal of Health Services'' 29(2):261-293, 1999.  Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

She is a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University in Boston,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fellowships/takemi-fellowship-program/ Takemi Program], [[Harvard T.H.

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals.

'''[[Demographics]] of the [[world]]''' include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health measures, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the human population of the planet [[Earth]]. 

The overall total population of the world is approximately 7.5 billion, as of March 2018. 

Its overall population density is 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile), excluding Antarctica. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in [[Asia]] and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of [[China]] and [[India]] combined. The world's fairly low [[literacy]] rate (83.7%) is attributable to [[poverty]]. Lower literacy rates are common in [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

The world's largest ethnic group is [[Han Chinese]] with [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the world's most spoken language in terms of native speakers.

Human migration has been shifting toward cities and urban centers, with the urban population jumping from 29% in 1950, to 50.5% in 2005.&lt;ref name="cia world"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA.gov World Factbook - World Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working backwards from the United Nations prediction that the world will be 51.3 percent urban by 2010, Dr. Ron Wimberley, Dr. Libby Morris and Dr. Gregory Fulkerson estimated 23 May 2007 to be the first time the urban population outnumbered the rural population in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/go/7334/ World Population Becomes More Urban That Rural]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---There are approximately 3.38  billion females in the World. The number of males is about 3.41 billion. ---&gt;

People under 18 years of age made up over a quarter of the world population (29.3%), and people age 65 and over made up less than one-tenth (7.9%) in 2011.&lt;ref name="cia world"/&gt;

== History ==
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 30,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized.

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = 5 February 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=5 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over seven billion,&lt;ref name=7billpop&gt;{{cite web|title=UN population estimates.|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/p2k0data.asp|work=Population Division, United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live in [[urban area]]s by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4561183.stm | work=BBC News | first=David | last=Whitehouse | title=Half of humanity set to go urban | date=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for humans living in [[city|cities]] include various forms of pollution and [[crime]],&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- {{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825142912/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df= }} --&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/usrv98.pdf Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993–98] U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,.

==Cities==
The World has hundreds of major cities spread across 6 continents. Most are in coastal regions.

{{As of|2005}}, the World had 62 metropolitan areas with a population of over 3,000,000 people each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/2005_city_population_01.html 2005 World City Populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, about 3 billion people live in or around urban areas.&lt;ref name="cia world" /&gt;

[[File:Population density countries 2018 world map, people per sq km.svg|300px|thumb|Population density (people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by country, 2018]]

The [[world's population]] is 7 billion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA - The World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per km² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-states]], [[microstates]] or [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories share a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

{{Further information|List of religious populations}}

The table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, [[Cao Đài]] is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while [[Hòa Hảo]] is not, even though they are similar [[new religious movement]]s.

The population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.

Since the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some [[Western civilization|countries with a historically large Christian population]] have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see [[demographics of atheism]]. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the [[priest]]hood and [[monastery|monastic life]], as well as diminishing attendance at [[Church service|church]].  On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate.  In the realm of [[Western civilization]], there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as [[secular humanism|secular humanists]]. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional [[Eastern Christianity]] and in the forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[Far Eastern religions]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt; Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and also in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php U.S. Census Bureau, June 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701122431/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries experienced [[Population decline|negative population growth]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]] mainly due to low [[fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]]. In [[Southern Africa]], growth is slowing due to the high number of [[HIV]]-related deaths. Some [[Western Europe]] countries might also encounter negative population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 UN population projections]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tpNJ6FqS?url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 |date=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]'s population began decreasing in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/02/japan-population |title=Japan sees biggest population fall |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population in the world increased from 1990 to 2008 with 1,423 million and 27% growth. Measured by persons, the increase was highest in [[India]] (290 million) and [[China]] (192 million).

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA - The World Factbook]], the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm Uneca.org: Crude Birth Rates - The World and its Major Regions, 1950-2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816073652/http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU |work=Thejournal.ie |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html |title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise |work=The Irish Times |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/01/cdc.births.decline/index.html |title=CDC records rise in birth rate for women over 40 |work=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading [[causes of death]] in 2002 were:
&lt;!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf --&gt;
# 12.6% [[Ischemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infection]]s
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal disease]]s
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers]]
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''[[L'Empire de la honte]]'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—died of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths "due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40" as age-related.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|| reference uses an extremely broad definition of "age-related" deaths, including even traffic accidents due to poor eyesight|date=June 2018}} In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.02 males/female,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Fact Book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a sex ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 ([[Saudi Arabia]] 1.13, [[United Arab Emirates]] 2.73, [[Qatar]] 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[foreign worker|guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

There is an inverse correlation between [[income and fertility]], wherein [[Developed country|developed countries]] usually have a much lower [[fertility rate]]. Various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] may be involved, such as education and urbanization. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable.  However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined.  Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage3.nifty.com/sociology/motion.html Graph Charts of TFR and FLR using Google Motion Chart using World Bank's World Development Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012}}

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry.

===Unemployment rate===
8.7% (2010 est.)
8.2% (2009 est.)
note: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)

===Demonym===
The [[demonym]] for Earth's inhabitants is [[wikt:Earthling|Earthling]] or, as either a noun or an adjective, [[wikt:Terran|Terran]].

{{Main article|Language family}}

Worldwide, [[English language|English]] is used widely as a [[lingua franca]] and can be seen to be the dominant language at this time. The world's largest language by native speakers is [[Mandarin Chinese]] which is a [[first language]] of around 960 million people, or 12.44% of the population, predominantly in [[Greater China]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken by around 330 to 400 million people, predominantly in the [[Americas]] and [[Spain]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is spoken by around 280 million people. [[Hindi]] is spoken by about 200 million speakers, mostly in [[India]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is spoken by around 230 million people, predominantly in India and Bangladesh. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken by about 230 million speakers in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[East Timor]], and [[Southern Africa]].

There are numerous other languages, grouped into nine major families:

# [[Indo-European languages]] 46% ([[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Oceania]])
# [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] 21% ([[East Asia]])
# [[Niger–Congo languages]] 6.4% ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
# [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] 6.0% ([[North Africa]] to [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Western Asia]])
# [[Austronesian languages]] 5.9% ([[Oceania]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]])
# [[Dravidian languages]] 3.7% ([[South Asia]])
# [[Altaic languages]] (controversial combination of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic families) 2.3% ([[Central Asia]], [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]), and [[Anatolia]])&lt;ref&gt;Since the Mongolic and Tungusic language families have only a relatively small number of speakers, the majority of the Altaic percentage represents speakers of Turkic languages&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Austroasiatic languages]] 1.7% ([[Indochina|Mainland Southeast Asia]])

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
'''Eastern Bloc media and propaganda''' was controlled directly by each country's [[Communist party]], which controlled the [[state media]], [[censorship]] and [[propaganda]] organs. State and party ownership of print, television and radio media served as an important manner in which to control information and society in light of [[Eastern Bloc]] leaderships viewing even marginal groups of  [[soviet dissident|opposition intellectuals]] as a potential threat to the bases underlying Communist power therein.

Circumvention of dissemination controls occurred to some degree through [[samizdat]] and limited reception of western radio and television broadcasts. In addition, some regimes heavily restricted the flow of information from their countries to outside of the Eastern Bloc by heavily regulating the travel of foreigners and segregating approved travellers from the domestic population.

==Background==

===Creation===
[[File:EasternBlocAfter.svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Eastern Bloc]] (until 31 December 1992)]]
[[Bolsheviks]] took power following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920. With the defeat of the [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish–Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]], Byelorussian SSR and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ([[Soviet Union]]).

At the end of [[World War II]], all eastern and central European capitals were controlled by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="wettig69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final stages of the war, the Soviet Union began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by occupying several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northeastern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 180,000 further square miles (465,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.&lt;ref name="graubard150"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was also wrongfully considered part of the Bloc,&lt;ref name="crampton216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=216–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition.

===Conditions===

{{further|Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc politics|Eastern Bloc economies}}
Throughout the Eastern Bloc, both in the Soviet Socialist Republic and elsewhere, Russia was given prominence, and referred to as the ''naibolee vıdayuşayasya naciya'' (the most prominent nation) and the ''rukovodyaşy narod'' (the leading people).&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt; The Soviets encouraged the admiration of everything Russian and the reproduction of their own Communist structural hierarchies in each of the Bloc states.&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt;

The defining characteristic of Communism as implemented in the Eastern Bloc was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.&lt;ref name="hardt11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], multi-party governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name="hardt12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets mandated expropriation and ''etatization'' of private property.&lt;ref name="roht83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-style "replica regimes" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.&lt;ref name="roht83"/&gt; Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the basis underlying Communist power.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of dissidence and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and period.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"/&gt;

While over 15 million Eastern Bloc residents migrated westward from 1945 to 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|pp=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; emigration was effectively halted in the early 1950s, with the Soviet approach to controlling national movement emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Eastern Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of extensive rather than intensive development, and thus lagging far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name="hardt15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and information control===
{{further|Deutscher Fernsehfunk|Rundfunk der DDR|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia|Soviet Information Bureau}}
In the [[Eastern Bloc]], the state owned and operated the means of mass communication.&lt;ref name="frucht489"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling authorities viewed media as a propaganda tool, and widely practiced censorship to exercise almost full control over the information dissemination.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt;  The press in Communist countries was an organ of, and completely reliant on, the state.&lt;ref name="oneil15"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the late 1980s, all Eastern Bloc radio and television organizations were state-owned (and tightly controlled), while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local Communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth newspapers and magazines were owned by youth organizations affiliated with the communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt;  The governing body in the Soviet Union was "USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting", or USSR Gosteleradio (Государственный комитет по телевидению и радиовещанию СССР, Гостелерадио СССР), which was in charge both of [[Soviet TV]] and [[Radio in the Soviet Union]].

The Communist party exercised control over the media and was responsible for censorship.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt; Media served as an important form of control over information and thus of society.&lt;ref name="oneil1"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eastern Bloc authorities viewed the dissemination and portrayal of knowledge as vital to the survival of Communism and thus stifled alternative concepts and critiques.&lt;ref name="oneil1"/&gt;  Several state Communist Party newspapers were published. Radio was initially the dominant medium, with television being considered low on the priority list when compiling [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans]] during the [[industrialisation]] of the 1950s.

===Censorship and squashing of dissent===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|image2=The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|width=180|caption2=[[Nikolai Yezhov]], the young man strolling with [[Joseph Stalin]] to his right, was shot in 1940.

{{further|Censorship in East Germany|Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|Censorship in the Soviet Union|   Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Anti-Soviet agitation}}
Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc, though it was at times circumvented by those engaging in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref name="major6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship institutions in the countries of the Bloc were organized differently.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; For example, censorship in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] was clearly identified whereas it was loosely structured, but no less efficient, in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Strict censorship was introduced in the [[People's Republic of Albania]] and [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] as early as 1944, though it was somewhat relaxed in Yugoslavia after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] of 1948.&lt;ref name="frucht127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the rest of the Eastern Bloc, relative freedom existed for three years in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] until Soviet-style censorship was fully applied in 1948,&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; along with the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]].

Throughout the Bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on writers.&lt;ref name="major15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural products reflected the propaganda needs of the state&lt;ref name="major15"/&gt; and Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years.&lt;ref name="crampton247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they would have otherwise suggested that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]].&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;  Under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop.&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;

In each country, leading bodies of the ruling Communist Part exercised hierarchical control of the censorship system.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Each Communist Party maintained a department of its [[Central Committee]] apparatus to supervise media.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  Censors employed auxiliary tools such as: the power to launch or close down any newspaper, radio or television station, licensing of journalists through unions and the power of appointment.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Party bureaucrats held all leading editorial positions.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  One or two representatives of censorship agencies modeled on the Soviet GLAVLIT (Main Administration for the Protection of Official and Military Secrets) worked directly in all editorial offices.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  No story could be printed or broadcast without their explicit approval.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;

Initially, [[East Germany]] presented unique issues because of rules for the occupying powers in the divided Germany (e.g. regarding media control) that prevented the outright seizure of all media outlets.&lt;ref name="pike219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet occupation administration (SVAG) directed propaganda and censorship policies to East German censorship organs through its "sector for propaganda and censorship".&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; While the initial SVAG policies did not appear to differ greatly from those in the western occupation zones governing [[denazification]],&lt;ref name="pike220"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship became one of the most overt instruments used to manipulate political, intellectual and cultural developments in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike217"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=217–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art societies and associations that had existed prior to World War II were dissolved and all new theatres and art societies had to register with SVAG.&lt;ref name="pike221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art exhibits were put under a blanket ban unless censorship organs approved them in advance.&lt;ref name="pike221"/&gt;

After East Germany's official establishment, while the original constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ddr/verfddr1949.html October 7, 1949 Constitution of East Germany], German Document Archive {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that "censorship of the media is not to occur", both official and unofficial censorship occurred, although to a lesser extent during its later years. Thereafter, official East German censorship was supervised and carried out by two governmental organizations, the ''Head office for publishing companies and bookselling trade'' (Hauptverwaltung Verlage und Buchhandel, HV), and the ''Bureau for Copyright'' (Büro für Urheberrechte). The HV determined the degree of censorship and the method of publishing and marketing works. The Bureau for Copyright appraised the work, then decided if it or another publication was permitted to be published in East Germany or in foreign country. For theatres, a "repertory commission" was created that consisted of the ''Ministerium für Volksbildung'' (MfV), the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the applicable theatre union and the East German office for theatrical affairs.&lt;ref name="pike236"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long visa procurement process, western visitors driving over the West German border to East Germany had their car strip-searched for prohibited Western "propaganda material."&lt;ref name="philipsen9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the East German authorities found it extremely difficult to prevent their citizens listening to Western radio stations and [[ARD (broadcaster)|Western TV]] was available across most of the GDR. Technical and diplomatic considerations meant attempts at [[Radio jamming|jamming]] Western Stations were (unlike in other Eastern bloc countries) soon abandoned.

In the Soviet Union, in accordance with the official ideology and politics of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], [[Goskomizdat]] censored all printed matter, [[Goskino]] supervised all [[film|cinema]], [[Gosteleradio]] controlled radio and television broadcasting and the [[First Department]] in many agencies and institutions, such as the State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), was responsible for assuring that state secrets and other sensitive information only reached authorized hands. The Soviets destroyed pre-revolutionary and foreign material from libraries, leaving only "special collections" (''[[spetskhran]]''), accessible by special permit from the [[KGB]]. The [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union also censored images]], included removing repressed persons from texts, posters, paintings and photographs.

Throughout the Eastern Bloc, artists or those attempting to disseminate dissenting views were repressed, with a few of the more prominent victims including:

He was brutally murdered in 1984 by agents of [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] (Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs). 

Other artists, such as [[Geo Bogza]], used subtle imagery or allegories within their works to criticize regimes. This did not prevent state scrutiny, as with the case of Bogza coming under the scrutiny of the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiorean, Claudia Talaşman, "Promovarea mitului Erei Noi în perioada 1989–2000 prin ''România Literară''", p.138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Printed media in the Soviet Union|Television in the Soviet Union|Radio in the Soviet Union|Internet in the Soviet Union}}&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt;
The major newspapers were traditionally the daily official publications of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Newspapers served as the main party organs of record and provided official political roadmaps for officials and other readers who needed to be informed.&lt;ref name="frucht639"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the press provided a significant source of income for the ruling Communist parties.&lt;ref name="frucht639"/&gt; Radio and television was controlled by the state.&lt;ref name="frucht490"/&gt;  The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) was the central agency for collection and distribution of internal and international news for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. TASS monopolized the supply of political news.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; It was frequently infiltrated by Soviet intelligence and security agencies, such as the [[NKVD]] and [[GRU]]. TASS had affiliates in 14 Soviet republics, including the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], [[Estonian SSR]], [[Moldavian SSR]]. [[Ukrainian SSR]] and [[Byelorussian SSR]].

Despite outward similarities in press policy, large differences existed in the roles and functions of the mass media in Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref name="frucht640"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the press was allowed more freedom, such as in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, a national subtext and a significant element of entertainment flourished.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; In some cases, newspapers and magazines served as the most visible part of liberalizing forces, such as in Poland in 1956 and 1980–81, in Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In many instances toward the end of the Eastern Bloc's existence, the ruling Communist parties' messages in the press increasingly diverged from reality, which contributed to the declining faith of the public in Communist rule.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  At the same time, some press in the Eastern Bloc became more open in the 1980s in countries such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  In Yugoslavia, the press after Tito's reign turned increasingly nationalistic.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; Only in Romania and Albania did the press remain under tight dictatorial control right up until the end of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In [[East Germany]], where initial control could be less overt because of shared allied occupation rules, the Soviet SVG set up the Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung (DVV) in the fall of 1945.&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; The SVAG and DVV controlled and approved all publication licenses needed to publish newspapers, books, journals and other materials.&lt;ref name="pike225"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=225–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those agencies also provided the top publishing priorities and would apportion paper used for printing to the various publications in accordance with those priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; The SVAG initially licensed some private publishers which required the employment of a greater number of censors.&lt;ref name="pike227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of information flow out of the Eastern Bloc==
Beginning in 1935, [[Joseph Stalin]] effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents that were permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"/&gt;  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrest or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"/&gt;

Similarly, the regimes in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] carefully controlled foreign visitors in order to restrict the flow of information coming out of (and into) Romania.&lt;ref name="deletantix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, activities in Romania remained, until the late 1960s, largely unknown to the outside world.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; As a result, until 1990, very little information regarding labour camps and prisons in Romania appeared in the West.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; When such information appeared, it was usually in Romanian émigré publications.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; Romania's [[Securitate]] secret police were able to suppress information leaking to the west about resistance to the regime.&lt;ref name="deletantxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stalinist [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], which had become increasingly paranoid and isolated after [[de-Stalinization]] and the death of [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref name="olsen19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; restricted visitors to 6,000 per year, and segregated those few that traveled to Albania.&lt;ref name="turnock48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda efforts==
{{further|Communist propaganda|Propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland|Propaganda in the Soviet Union}}
Communist leaders in the Eastern Bloc openly discussed the existence of propaganda efforts. Communist propaganda goals and techniques were tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets was:&lt;ref name=clews&gt;John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt;
*Domestic propaganda
*External propaganda
*Propaganda of Communist supporters outside the Communist states

Communist Party documents reveal a more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.).&lt;ref name=clews/&gt;

Because the Communist Party was portrayed under [[Marxist-Leninist]] theory as the protagonist of history pushing toward the inevitable end result of historical materialism as a "vanguard of the working class", Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the purported historical end itself.&lt;ref name="Satter1"&gt;[[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Propaganda often worked itself beyond [[agit prop]] plays into traditional productions, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], where the director of the National Theatre produced a version of ''Macbeth'' in which the villainous king was revealed as none other than hated (in the Eastern Bloc) Yugoslavian Leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref name="crampton269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding economic woes, debilitating wage cuts following economic stagnation were referred to as "blows in the face of imperialism", while forced loans were called "voluntary contributions to the building of socialism".&lt;ref name="crampton273"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in his ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] ''The ABC of Communism'' (1969 translation: {{ISBN|0-14-040005-2}}), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/10.htm Chapter 10: Communism and Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The State propaganda of communism becomes in the long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois propaganda dating from the old régime; and it is a powerful instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of a new outlook on the world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:West german tv penetration.svg|thumb|200px|right|Penetration of West German TV reception (grey) in East Germany for [[Das Erste|ARD]] (regional channels  [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], [[Hessischer Rundfunk|HR]], [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] and [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]]) . Areas with no reception (black) were jokingly referred to as "Valley of the Clueless" ''(Tal der Ahnungslosen)'' while ARD was said to stand for "Außer (except) Rügen und Dresden" .]]
Some propaganda would "retell" the western news, such as the [[East German]] television program [[Der schwarze Kanal]] ("The Black Channel"), which contained [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] programs from [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] with added [[Communist]] commentary.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130416082604/http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-04-16 | title = Fade to black | accessdate = 2006-02-20 | last = Hancock | first = Dafydd | date = 2001-01-01 | publisher = Intertel from Transdiffusion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Black channel" was a play on words deriving from the term German plumbers used for a sewer. The program was meant to counter ideas received by some from West German television because the geography of the divided [[Germany]] meant that West German television signals (particularly [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]) could be received in most of East Germany, except in parts of Eastern [[Saxony]] around Dresden, which consequently earned the latter the nickname "valley of the clueless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/11/09/east.php | title = East Germany Struggles, 5 Years After Wall Fell | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | last = Mitchener | first = Brandon | date = 1994-11-09 | publisher = International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite the fact that some Western radio was still available there).

Eastern Bloc leaders, including even [[Joseph Stalin]], could become personally involved in dissemination. For example, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, one month later, the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]''.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts96"/&gt; Stalin personally edited the book, rewriting entire chapters by hand.&lt;ref name="roberts96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book claimed, for instance, that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"/&gt;

The book referred to "the American falsifiers and their British and French associates",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed "[a]s far back as in 1937 it became perfectly clear that a big war was being hatched by Hitler with the direct connivance of Great Britain and France",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; blasted "the claptrap of the slanderers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated "[n]aturally, the falsifiers of history and slanderers are called falsifiers and slanderers precisely because they do not entertain any respect for facts. They prefer to gossip and slander."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Germany]], the Soviet SVAG and DVV initially controlled all publication priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; In the initial months of 1946, the Soviets were unsure how to merge propaganda and censorship efforts in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;  The SVAG engaged in a broad propaganda campaign that moved beyond customary political propaganda to engage in the practice at unions, women's organizations and youth organizations.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;

==Bypassing censorship==

===Clandestine information passing===
{{main|Samizdat|Magnitizdat|Polish underground press}}
[[Samizdat]] was the clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature or other media in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. Copies were often made in small quantities of handwritten or typed documents, while recipients were expected to make additional copies. Samizdat traders used underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression under the heavy censorship of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ''[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm#_VPID_36 History of Dissident Movement in the USSR. The birth of Samizdat]'' by [[Ludmila Alekseyeva]]. Vilnius, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was fraught with danger as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying [[censorship|censored]] materials.   Former Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] defined it as follows: "I myself create it, edit it, censor it, publish it, distribute it, and [may] get imprisoned for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} "Самиздат: сам сочиняю, сам редактирую, сам цензурирую, сам издаю, сам распространяю, сам и отсиживаю за него." (autobiographical novel ''И возвращается ветер...'', ''And the Wind returns...'' NY, Хроника, 1978, p.126) Also online at [http://www.vehi.net/samizdat/bukovsky.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the longest-running and well-known samizdat publications was the information bulletin "Хроника текущих событий" (Khronika Tekushchikh Sobitiy; ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/chr/index.htm Chronicle of Current Events] Archive at memo.ru&lt;/ref&gt; which contained anonymously published pieces dedicated to the defense of [[human rights]] in the USSR. Several people were arrested in connection with the ''Chronicle'', including [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Yuri Shikhanovich]], [[Pyotr Yakir]], [[Victor Krasin]], [[Sergei Kovalev]], [[Alexander Lavut]], [[Tatyana Velikanova]], among others.

[[Magnitizdat]] (in Russian магнитиздат) is the process of re-copying and self distributing live audio tape recordings in the Soviet Union that were not available commercially. The process of magnitizdat was less risky than publishing literature via samizdat, since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private reel-to-reel tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.  "Tamizdat" refers to literature published abroad (там, tam, meaning "there"), often from smuggled manuscripts.

===Western role in propaganda war===
{{further|British Broadcasting Corporation|Voice of America|Radio Free Europe}}
Western countries invested heavily in powerful transmitters which enabled broadcasters to be heard in the Eastern Bloc, despite attempts by authorities to [[Radio jamming|jam]] such signals. In 1947, VOA started broadcasting in [[Russian language|Russian]] with the intent to counter Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies, and disseminate pro western propaganda directed against Soviet leaders and policies.&lt;ref name='whitton'&gt;''Cold War Propaganda'' by John B. Whitton, [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 151–153&lt;/ref&gt;  These included [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE)), [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS (Berlin)]] the [[Voice of America]]  (VOA), [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France International]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref name="frucht490"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Union responded by attempting aggressive, electronic [[Radio jamming|jamming]]  of VOA (and some other Western) broadcasts in 1949.&lt;ref name='whitton'/&gt;  The [[BBC World Service]] similarly broadcast language-specific programming to countries behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, it obtained a transmitter base at [[Lampertheim]], [[West Germany]] and on July 4 of the same year, RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at [[Czechoslovakia]]&lt;ref&gt;Mickelson, Sig, "America's Other Voice: the Story of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty" (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1983): Mickelson 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts were often banned in Eastern Europe and Communist authorities used sophisticated [[Radio jamming|jamming]] techniques in an attempt to prevent citizens from listening to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, and became more than just a "mouthpiece for exiles" who had fled Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While RFE was cleared of charges that it gave Hungarian listeners false hope during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], its Broadcast Analysis Division was established to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists' former [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1960 study concluded that RFE possessed considerably more listeners than the BBC or VOA.&lt;ref name="puddington131"/&gt; The study concluded that the BBC was regarded as the most objective and the VOA had suffered a notable decline since it stopped critical broadcasts on the communist world after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], focusing instead on world news, American culture and jazz.&lt;ref name="puddington131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9776">{{For|oikoumene.org|World Council of Churches}}
The '''ecumene''' ([[American English|US]]) or '''oecumene''' ([[British English|UK]]; {{lang-grc-gre|οἰκουμένη}}, ''oikouménē'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"inhabited") was an ancient Greek term for the known, the inhabited, or the habitable world. Under the [[Roman Empire]], it came to refer to [[civilization]] as well as the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is most often used in the context of "[[Ecumenism|ecumenical]]" and describes the [[Christian Church]] as a unified whole, or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in [[cartography]] to describe a type of [[world map]] (''[[mappa mundi]]'') used in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|A modern depiction of the ecumene described by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term cited above is the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[present tense|present]] [[middle voice|middle]] [[participle]] of the verb {{lang|grc|οἰκέω}} (''oikéō'', "to inhabit") and is a [[clipping (morphology)|clipped form]] of {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη γῆ}} (''oikouménē gē'', "inhabited world").&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. "œcumene, ''n''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greece==
[[Image:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] world map from the [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] (Johannes Schnitzer, 1482).]]
[[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (276–196&amp;nbsp;BC) deduced the [[circumference of the Earth]] with remarkable accuracy (within 10% of the correct value). The Greek cartographer [[Crates of Mallus|Crates]] created a globe about 150&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Klein | first =Samuel John | contribution =Oecumene | year =2005 | title =Cartography Word of the Day | publisher =Designorati | url = http://designorati.com/articles/t1/cartography/462/cartography-word-of-the-day-oecumene.php | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (83–161) calculated the Earth's surface in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] and described the inhabited portion as spanning 180&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[longitude]] (from the [[Fortunate Isles]] in the west to [[Serae]] and [[Serica]] ([[China]]) in the east) and about 80&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[latitude]]{{refn|Although Ptolemy did not measure [[latitude]] with degrees but with hours of [[midsummer]] daylight, from 12 at the equator to 24 in the [[Arctic Circle|arctic]].}} (from [[Thule]] in the north to anti-[[Meroë]] below the [[equator]]). Ptolemy was well aware that the Romans knew only about a quarter of the globe{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and his erroneous belief that the [[Indian Ocean]] was landlocked led to expectation of a [[terra incognita]] ("unknown land"). In fact, [[symmetry]] led him to expect that there should be three other continents to balance the ecumene: Perioeci ({{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"beside the ecumene"), Antoeci ("opposite the ecumene") and the [[Antipodes]] (“opposite the feet”).

==Rome==
The cameo [[Gemma Augustea]] includes a Roman artistic personification of Oikoumene as she crowns an emperor, probably [[Augustus]], perhaps for bringing peace to the (Roman) world.

[[Image:THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.]]
The word was adopted within [[Christianity]] after [[Constantine the Great]]'s assembly of a [[synod]] of [[bishop]]s from all over the world at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

By that time, the Greek term had come to refer more specifically to the civilized world and then simply the [[Roman Empire]]. This usage continued after the [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian Reforms]] and the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] used it to refer to their imperial administration. [[Constantinople]] was the "Ecumenical City" and, after 586, the Patriarch of Constantinople was known as the "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]". [[Pope Gregory I]] objected to the adoption of this style by [[John IV of Constantinople]], as it implied a universal jurisdiction he believed to be held by the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Schaff | first =Philip | author-link =Philip Schaff | contribution =Gregory and the Universal Episcopate | year =1882 | title =History of the Christian Church | volume =IV: Mediaeval Christianity: A.D. 590–1073 | place=Peabody, Massachusetts  | publisher =Hendrickson Publishers; 3rd edition (July 1, 1996)  | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc4.i.iv.iv.html | accessdate =2008-01-03 | isbn =978-1-56563-196-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Fifth Epistle berates John for having "attempted to seize upon a new name, whereby the hearts of all your brethren might have come to take offence",&lt;ref&gt;St&amp;nbsp;Gregory&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great.

The name continues to be borne by the [[Greek Orthodox]] patriarchs, although with the more restricted sense that they are the bishops of the former imperial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution =The Universal Patriarch | title =The Witness | volume =XXV, No. 13, August 3/16, 1981 | place=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher =Holy Transfiguration Monastery | url = http://www.homb.org/st_annas/Articles/UniversalPatriarch.pdf | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==

===Religion===
{{main|Ecumenism}}
[[Image:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|right|220px|An ecumenical worship service at [[Taizé Community]].]]
Especially in the 20th century, the term has been employed to refer to unified [[Christian Church]] which is the ultimate goal of [[Ecumenism]], a movement to promote cooperation among the various [[Christian denomination]]s. The movement is not accepted by many Christian groups. The work of ecumenism takes place in the form of negotiations conducted between committees of various denominations and also through the deliberations of inter-denominational organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]]. Relevant issues include [[Baptism]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Christian ministry|Ministry]].

===Culture===
[[File:Spread of Oecumene Mesopotamia.jpg|thumb|Known world of the Mesopotamian, Babylonian, and Assyrian cultures from documentary sources]]
In the context of [[cultural history]], [[Lewis Mumford]] used the term "ecumene" in an academic sense in his work, ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mumford | first = Lewis | author-link = Lewis Mumford | year = 1934 | title = Technics and Civilization | place = New York | publisher = Harcourt | url = http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720153921/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | archivedate = 2008-07-20 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]]  later popularized it in his [[The Rise of the West | ''Rise of the West'']] (1963), suggesting that a single global ecumene emerged through the dominance of European political institutions, science, technology, and economic forms from the late 18th century onwards. One could argue that prior to the great voyages of discovery carried out by [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Vasco da Gama]], and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], there were originally two separate ecumenes—one covering the [[Old World]] and one the [[New World|New]]. The Spanish [[conquistador]]es fused these two ecumenes to form a single integrated "[[World-systems theory|world system]]".

[[Peter Sloterdijk]] uses the terms "First Ecumene" and "Second Ecumene" in his book ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/01/world-interior-capital-peter-sloterdijk-review In the World Interior of Capital]'' (2014, original German: ''Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals'', 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860834263|title= In the world interior of capital : for a philosophical theory of globalization|last= 1947-|first= Sloterdijk, Peter,|publisher= |others= Hoban, Wieland,|year= |isbn= 9780745647692|edition = English|location= Cambridge, UK|pages= 143–148|oclc= 860834263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sloterdijk takes these terms directly from the work of [[Eric Voegelin]], specifically from ''Order and History'' vol. 4, ''The Ecumenic Age'' (1974), &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21151456|title= The collected works of Eric Voegelin|last= 1901-1985.|first= Voegelin, Eric,|date= 2007|origyear= 1989|publisher= [[Louisiana State University Press]]|others= Sandoz, Ellis, 1931-, Weiss, Gilbert,, Petropulos, William,|isbn= 9780826213013|location= Baton Rouge|oclc= 21151456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} which he quotes.

Note that the term "ecumene" can differ depending on the viewpoint from which it is perceived: for example, the Ancient Babylonians and the Ancient Greeks would each have known a different area of the world (though their worlds may have overlapped). Compare image to the right.

=== Cartography ===
The term is used in [[cartography]] and the historical cartography to describe a type{{which|date=March 2015}} of symbolic, schematic [[world map]] made in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

==Impact on disease==

===Impact on vascular disease===
[[File:Erythromelalgia.jpg|[[Erythromelalgia]] in a 77-year-old woman |thumb]]
A good example of the impact of global warming on health can be seen in the disease [[erythromelalgia]].&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=T |last2=Zhang |first2=Y |last3=Lin |first3=H |last4=Lv |first4=X |last5=Xiao |first5=J |last6=Zeng |first6=W |last7=Gu |first7=Y |last8=Rutherford |first8=S |last9=Tong |first9=S|last10=Ma|first10=W |display-authors=3 |title=A large temperature fluctuation may trigger an epidemic erythromelalgia outbreak in China |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |date=30 March 2015 |volume=5 |id=Article Number 9525 |pmid=25820221 |doi=10.1038/srep09525 |pmc=4377627 |pages=9525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a vascular disease that is commonly triggered by the involvement of change in temperature, which leads to syndromes including (first and second degree) burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling, of mainly the hands and feet that are affected.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

In a Chinese study, epidemic Erythromelalgia appears quite common in southern China, most likely due to a sharp decline in temperature following by a rapid increase of temperature and the effects this has on the body.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;  The acral small superficial arteries intensely constrict and dilate during the sharp decline of temperature, whereas a sharp increase of temperature, the intense expansion of [[capillaries]] irritate the nerve endings around, and thus lead to symptoms including burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;
As climate change proceeds, more Erythromelalgia outbreaks may occur because of the extreme weather events that are projected to increase in coming decades.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

Warming oceans and a changing climate are resulting in extreme weather patterns which have brought about an increase of [[infectious diseases]]—both new and re-emerging.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA29 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=The Mosquito's Bite |pp=29–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerging Infections" /&gt;  These extreme weather patterns are creating extended [[rainy seasons]] in some areas,&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA62 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=Sobering Predictions |pp=62–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended periods of [[drought]] in others,&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meehl |first1=Gerald A. |first2=Thomas F. |last2=Stocker |first3=W.D. |last3=Collins |first4=P. |last4=Friedlingstein |first5=A.T. |last5=Gaye |first6=J.M. |last6=Gregory |first7=A. |last7=Kitoh |first8=R. |last8=Knutti |first9=J.M. |last9=Murphy |first10=A. |last10=Noda |first11=S.C.B. |last11=Raper |first12=I.G. |last12=Watterson |first13=A.J. |last13=Weaver |first14=Z.-C. |last14=Zhao |display-authors=3 |chapter=Global Climate Projections |editor-last1=Solomon |editor-first1=S. |editor-first2=D. |editor-last2=Qin |editor-first3=M. |editor-last3=Manning |editor-first4=Z. |editor-last4=Chen |editor-first5=M. |editor-last5=Marquis |editor-first6=K.B. |editor-last6=Averyt |editor-first7=M. |editor-last7=Tignor |editor-first8=H.L. |editor-last8=Miller |display-editors=3 |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

==== Impact of warmer and wetter climates ====

Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include [[malaria]], [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reiter |first=Paul |title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |year=2001 |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=141–161 |url=http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s1141 |pmid=11250812 |pmc=1240549 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824222504/http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P.R. |title=Climate change and waterborne and vector-borne disease |journal=[[Journal of Applied Microbiology]] |year=2003 |volume=94 |pages=37S–46S |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.94.s1.5.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt; Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease" /&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis /&gt;   Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

[[Ticks]] are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.&lt;ref name=Ticks&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Süss |first1=J. |last2=Klaus |first2=C. |last3=Gerstengarbe |first3=F.W. |last4=Werner |first4=P.C. |title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. In addition to dehydration and heat stroke, these heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: the Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy|last=Glaser et al | pmid=27151892 | doi=10.2215/CJN.13841215|volume=11|issue=8 |pmc=4974898|year=2016|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|pages=1472–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.

Other diseases on the rise due to extreme weather include [[hantavirus]],&lt;ref name=Hantavirus&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klempa |first=B. |title=Hantaviruses and Climate Change |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |date=June 2009 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=518–523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02848.x|pmid=19604276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[schistosomiasis]],&lt;ref name=elephantiasis /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMichael |first1=A.J. |last2=Woodruff |first2=R.E. |last3=Hales |first3=S. |title=Climate change and human health: present and future risks |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=11 March 2006 |volume=367 |issue=9513 |pages=859–869 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68079-3|pmid=16530580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[onchocerciasis]] (river blindness),&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt;  and tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Emerging Infections"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Paul R. |title=Climate change and emerging infectious diseases |journal=Microbes and Infection |year=2001 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=747–754 |doi=10.1016/s1286-4579(01)01429-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also  causes the rise in hay fever, as when the weather gets warmer there is a rise in pollen levels in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaftel|first=Holly|year=2016|title=A blanket around the earth|url=|journal=A Blanket Around the Earth|volume=1|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projected increases in temperature would make parts of southwest Asia uninhabitable, when temperature combined with high humidity reaches a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of 35&amp;nbsp;°C, the threshold for a fit human to survive in well-ventilated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2833.html |title=Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability |journal=Nature |year=2015 |first1=Jeremy S. |last1=Pal |first2=Elfatih A.

Warmer temperatures may also lead an increase in aggression levels. Research has shows links between higher temperatures and increased aggressive and criminal behaviour. Which can be seen by the rise in the rate of criminality during the warmer summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhy|first=Susanta|date=2015|title=Mental health effects of climate change|journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3–7|pmc=4446935|pmid=26023264|doi=10.4103/0019-5278.156997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact of warmer oceans ====

The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as [[red tides]]) and [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt; As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within [[zooplankton]] emerge from their dormant state.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;  The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing [[cholera outbreaks]].&lt;ref name=Mozambique&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=6–28 |chapter=Mozambique}}&lt;/ref&gt; As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St. Louis |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hess |first2=Jeremy J. |title=Climate Change Impacts on and Implications for Global Health |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.023|pmid=18929979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Health" /&gt;

====Malaria====

[[Malaria]] is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the [[Plasmodium]] family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host's circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Brian M. |last1=Greenwood |first2=Kalifa |last2=Bojang |first3=Christopher J.M. |last3=Whitty |first4=Geoffrey A.T. |last4=Targett |title=Malaria |journal=The Lancet |date=23 April 2005 |volume=365 |pages=1487–1498 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66420-3 |pmid=15850634 |issue=9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

'About 3.2 billion people – nearly half of the world's population – are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were roughly 214 million malaria cases and an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/|title=10 facts on malaria|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.&lt;ref name=infectious/&gt; Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine [[pathogenicity]]. These include the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.&lt;ref name=infectious&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Mia |first2=Rawshan A. |last2=Begum |first3=Ah-Choy |last3=Er |first4=Raja D.Z.R. Zainal |last4=Abidin |first5=Joy J. |last5=Pereira |title=Malaria and Climate Change: Discussion on Economic Impacts |journal=[[American Journal of Environmental Sciences]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.3844/ajessp.2011.73.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.

Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes range from sixteen to eighteen degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name= commonwealth&gt;{{cite report |last=Githeko |first=Andrew K. |title=Malaria and climate change |work=Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Update 2009/2010 |url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the temperature is decreased by two degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.&lt;ref name=infectious2&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pates |first2=Christopher |last2=Curtis |title=Mosquito Behaviour and Vector Control |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |year=2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130439 |pmid=15355233}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.

Climate change has a direct impact on people's health in places where Malaria is not prevalent. In communities of higher altitudes in [[Africa]] and [[South America]], people are at higher risk for developing malaria in recent years because of an increase temperature. Mosquitos are sensitive to temperature changes and the warming of their environment will boost their rates of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|via=|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|pmid=16207843|pmc=2636266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.

The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.&lt;ref name=Goklany&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Indur M. |last1=Goklany |first2=Sir David A. |last2=King |title=Climate Change and Malaria |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2004 |volume=306 |issue=5693 |pages=55–57 |doi=10.1126/science.306.5693.55|pmid=15459370 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231205 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.

If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread [[epidemic]] of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the number of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before. It is simple for the slightest of fluctuation in temperature to cause a catastrophic epidemic that has the possibility to end the lives of many innocent and unsuspecting people.&lt;ref name= commonwealth/&gt;

====Dengue fever====

[[Dengue fever]] is an infectious disease caused by [[dengue virus]]es known to be in the tropical regions.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue and Severe Dengue, Fact Sheet |work=Media Centre |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is transmitted by the mosquito [[Aedes]], or A. aegypti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simmon |first=Cameron |last2=Farrar |first2=Jeremy J. |last3=Chau |first3=Nguyen van Vinh |last4=Wills |first4=Bridget |title=Dengue |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=12 April 2012 |volume=366 |issue=15 |pages=1423–1432 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1110265 |pmid=22494122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases of dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gubler |first=DJ |title=Human and Medical Virology: Dengue Viruses |editor-last1=Mahy |editor-first1=Brian W.J. |editor-last2=van Regenmortel |editor-first2=Marc H.V. |work=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&amp;pg=PA372 |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378559-6 |pages=372–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of [[dengue hemorrhagic fever]]. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.&lt;ref name=denguefever&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue Fever |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002350/ |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the work of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.&lt;ref name=denguefever/&gt;

Dengue fever used to be considered a [[tropical disease]], but [[climate change]] is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of [[mosquitoes]], which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing [[El Nino]] effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hopp |first=Marianne J. |last2=Foley |first2=Jonathan A. |title=Global-Scale Relationships Between Climate and the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes Aegypti |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=February 2001 |volume=48 |issue=2/3 |pages=441–463 |doi=10.1023/a:1010717502442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent.

==== Tick Borne Disease ====
A high humidity of greater than 85% is the best condition for a tick to start and finish its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Süss|first=Jochen|last2=Klaus|first2=Christine|last3=Gerstengarbe|first3=Friedrich‐Wilhelm|last4=Werner|first4=Peter C.|date=2008-01-01|title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

More specifically, maximum temperature has been found to play the most influential variable in sustaining tick populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Brownstein|last2=Holford|first2=Theodore|last3=Fish|first3=Durland|date=February 12, 2003|title=A Climate-Based Model Predicts the Spatial Distribution of the Lyme Disease Vector Ixodes scapularis in the United States|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241567/pdf/ehp0111-001152.pdf|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=11|pages=1152-1157|via=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher temperatures augment both hatching and developmental rates while hindering overall survival. Temperature is so important to overall survival that an average monthly minimum temperature of below -7°C in the winter can prevent an area from maintaining established populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The effect of climate on the tick life cycle is one of the more difficult projections to make in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles span multiple seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-and-health-assessment/vectorborne-diseases/boxes/life-cycle-blacklegged-ticks-ixodes|title=Life Cycle of Blacklegged Ticks, Ixodes scapularis {{!}} Climate and Health Assessment|last=USGCRP|website=health2016.globalchange.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, infection and spread of diseases such as Lyme disease happens across the multiple stages adding additional variables to consider. Infection of ticks happen in the larval/nymph stage (after the first blood meal) when they are exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease), but transmission to humans doesn’t occur until the adult stages. 

The expansion of tick populations are concurrent with global climatic change. Species distribution models of recent years indicate that the deer tick, known as ''I. scapularis,'' is pushing its distribution to higher latitudes of the Northeastern United States and Canada, as well as pushing and maintaining populations in the South Central and Northern Midwest regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esteve-Gassent|first=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844827/|journal=Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate models project further expansion of tick habit north into Canada as progressing Northwest from the Northeastern United States.

Tick populations are not only spreading wider, but moving to higher elevations. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick known as ''D. andersoni'' is found along the front range and is want to feed, and consequently infect, human populations with tularemia (''Francisella tularensis''), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (''Rickettsia rickettsii''), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus). A case study testing climatic interaction affecting tick vector (''D. andersoni'') populations in Larimer County, Colorado indicated that an estimated increase of 1.2–2.0 °C in summer temperatures would increase tick populations moving 100m upwards in elevation, increasing the range and susceptibility of tick-borne illnesses along the front range.

Initial symptoms of tick-borne infections are generally quite similar to that of other viral illnesses. This includes fever, headache, fatigue, and general malaise. This group of diseases can further be difficult to distinguish early on in the disease process due to these general symptoms in addition to most people (reported around 75%) not realizing they have been bitten or exposed to the tick vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadelman|first=Robert B.|last2=Nowakowski|first2=John|last3=Forseter|first3=Gilda|last4=Goldberg|first4=Neil S.|last5=Bittker|first5=Susan|last6=Cooper|first6=Denise|last7=Aguero-Rosenfeld|first7=Maria|last8=Wormser|first8=Gary P.|date=May 1996|title=The clinical spectrum of early lyme borreliosis in patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(95)99915-9/pdf|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=English|volume=100|issue=5|pages=502–508|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(95)99915-9|issn=0002-9343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to early Lyme disease is the development of the classic erythema migrans skin rash, also known as the “bull’s eye” or “target” rash, which occurs in about 80% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steere|first=Allen C.|last2=Sikand|first2=Vijay K.|date=2003-06-12|title=The Presenting Manifestations of Lyme Disease and the Outcomes of Treatment|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM200306123482423?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=348|issue=24|pages=2472–2474|doi=10.1056/nejm200306123482423|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom can be an important distinguishing factor helping to make the diagnosis early. If Lyme disease is unrecognized, misdiagnosed, or improperly treated it can lead to much more severe and serious consequences with the spread of the spirochete to joints, heart, and nervous system causing arthritis, carditis, cranial nerve palsies or encephalopathy and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regardless of the specific diagnosis (Lyme, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Babesiosis etc.) the key to management and prevention of sequelae is early identification of disease and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. With regard to the effects of a warming world and the expansion of tick populations to previously unexposed areas, adaptive keys to prevention will include expansion of health care infrastructure and pharmacologic availability, as well as education of people and providers as to the risks of disease and preventative measures they can take.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap15_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts,Adaptation, and Vulnerability|last=Mimura|first=Nobuo|last2=Pulwarty|first2=Roger|last3=Duc|first3=Do Minh|last4=Elshinnawy|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Redsteer|first5=Margaret|last6=Huang|first6=He-Qing|last7=Nkem|first7=Johnson|last8=Sanchez Rodriguez|first8=Roberto|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|pages=869-898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of these expanding threats, strong collaboration between government officials and environmental scientists is necessary for advancing preventative and reactive response measures. Without acknowledging the climate changes that make environments more habitable for disease carriers, policy and infrastructure will lag behind vector borne disease spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/08/06/21999/disease-bearing-ticks-head-north-weak-government-response-threatens-public-health|title=As disease-bearing ticks head north, weak government response threatens public health|work=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human cost associated with denying climate change science is one that concerns many governments.

===Impact on mental health{{anchor|Mental_health}}===
While the physical health impacts of [[climate change]] are well known, the impact on [[mental health]] has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chand |first1=Prabhat Kumar |last2=Murthy |first2=Pratima |title=Climate change and mental health |journal=Regional Health Forum |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pp=43–48 |url=http://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/who44.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2011 in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Clayton &amp; Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable [[populations]] and those with pre-existing serious [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=clayton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doherty |first1=Susan |last2=Clayton |first2=Thomas J |title=The psychological impacts of global climate change |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |year=2011 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1037/a0023141 |pmid=21553952 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/66/4/265/|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom in 2008 found that climate change exposes populations to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], which negatively impacts mental health in very serious ways.&lt;ref name=berry&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|last2=Kathryn|first2=Bowen|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|title=Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=2|pages=123–132|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00038-009-0112-0.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-0112-0|pmid=20033251|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the Clayton study and the Berry study identify three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: direct, indirect, and psychosocial.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; The Clayton study claims that in order to appreciate these impacts on psychological wellbeing, a basic understanding of certain aspects is required. One must recognize the multiple meanings and cultural narratives associated with climate change, as well as how climate change, global phenomena like increased population, are interrelated. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower [[economic]] and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; A 2018 study of CDC data connected temperature rise to increased numbers of suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/817731002|publisher=USA Today|year=2018|title=Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study revealed that hotter days could increase suicide rates and could cause approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase/565826/|title=Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050|website=The Atlantic|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct impacts====
Direct impacts on mental health happen when a [[community]] experiences [[extreme weather]] and changed [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; 
Direct impacts like landscape changes, impaired [[place attachment]], and [[psychological trauma]] are all immediate and localized problems resulting from extreme weather events and environmental changes.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Extreme weather events cause negative changes to landscape and [[agriculture]]. This leads to communities facing economic aspects, especially for communities that use agriculture as a main source of income. After economic fall, communities face loss of livelihoods and [[poverty]]. Many communities will also face isolation, alienation, [[grief]], bereavement, and displacement from these effects.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=portier&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |work=National Institute of Environment Health Services |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |date=1 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421191355/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals will have an increased rate of [[anxiety]] and emotional stress. The rate of effects on mental health increases in already-vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Clayton reinforces that the more powerful the extreme weather event, and the more frequent these weather events are, the more damage is done to the mental health of the community.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;
Some of the extreme weather events responsible for these mental health changes include wildfires,&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; and extreme heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Climate change and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indirect impacts====
Indirect impacts on mental health occur via impacts on physical health and community wellbeing. Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainly about future risks.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt; They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event effects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;
[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth/&gt; Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;

As extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.&lt;ref name=bowlby&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279–294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase. For every one-degree [[Fahrenheit]], there will be nine more murders in the country, which leads to an additional 24,000 murders or assaults per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2000-2004/01A.pdf|title=Heat and Violence|last=Anderson|first=C|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2001|isbn=|location=Iowa|pages=33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increased risk in [[suicide]] in communities that suffer from extreme weather events. Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.&lt;ref name=epstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;

Some impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

The effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

====Psychological impacts====
Psychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Agriculture and aquaculture are severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of kids from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt; The loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections. This leads to grief, anxiety, and an overall sense of loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Donald R. |last2=West |first2=Colin Thor |last3=Finan |first3=Timothy J. |title=Introduction to "In focus: Global change and adaptation in local places." |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=September 2009 |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=271–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01131.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change and permafrost==
[[Permafrost]] is an important part of our environment and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of many ecosystems around the world.  
===Soil sustainability===
Permafrost is integral to soil stability in arctic regions.&lt;ref name="Task Force"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinkel |first=Kenneth M |first2=Frederick E. |last2=Nelson |first3=Walter |last3=Parker |first4=Vladimir |last4=Romanovsky |first5=Orson |last5=Smith |first6=Walter |last6=Tucker |first7=Ted |last7=Vinson |first8=Lawson W. |last8=Brigham |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change, Permafrost, and Impacts on Civil Infrastructure |journal=U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force |year=2003 |pages=1–61 |url=http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112164129/http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting permafrost causes the surrounding soil to become unstable and settle.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt; Settlement of surface soil associated with melting permafrost leads to significant infrastructure instability and damage to roads, bridges, buildings, homes, pipelines and airstrips in affected areas.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt;

==Impact on natural resources==

===Drinking water===
In rural Africa and the Middle East, when droughts dry up the regular water supply, rural and impoverished families are forced to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth. Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the world can be attributed to contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalwater.org/background.htm |title=Water Shortage, Drinking Water Crisis Solutions |work=globalwater.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124043427/http://globalwater.org/background.htm |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reports: Drought-Stricken Somalis Dying From Contaminated Water |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=31 October 2009 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-03-22-voa28/324586.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberulosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clovice |last1=Kankya |first2=Adrian |last2=Muwonge |first3=Berit |last3=Djønne |first4=Musso |last4=Munyeme |first5=John |last5=Opuda-Asibo |first6=Eystein |last6=Skjerve |first7=James |last7=Oloya |first8=Vigdis |last8=Edvardsen |first9=Tone B |last9=Johansen |display-authors=3 |title=Isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria from pastoral ecosystems of Uganda: Public Health significance |journal=BMC Public Health |date=16 May 2011 |volume=11 |issue=320 |pp=1–9 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-320 |pmid=21575226 |pmc=3123205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/drought.asp |title=NRDC: Climate Change Threatens Health: Drought |work=nrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hans W. |last1=Paerl |first2=Jef |last2=Huisman |title=Blooms Like It Hot |journal=Science |date=4 April 2008 |volume=320 |issue=5872 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.1126/science.1155398 |pmid=18388279 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5872/57|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.6826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) Blooms |work=California Department of Public Health |date=18 September 2013 |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces Era Of Water Scarcity |work=WaterNews |publisher=Circle of Blue |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2008/world/us-faces-era-of-water-scarcity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fresh water===
As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. [[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on livestock==
Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.

===Greenhouse gas effects===
Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strategies&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016–2025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corvalán |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92 4 156248 X |url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat stress===
[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.

==Impact on plant based food==
[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops—from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels—all of which directly affect [[human health]]. Part of this variability in possible outcomes is from the various [[climate change model]]s used to project potential impacts; each model takes into account different factors and so come out with a slightly different result.&lt;ref name=Hertel&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hertel |first=Thomas W. |last2=Rosch |first2=Stephanie D. |title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Poverty |journal=[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]] |date=June 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=355–385 |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppq016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second problem comes from the fact that projections are made based on historical data which is not necessarily helpful in accurate forecasting as changes are occurring exponentially.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kul&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kulshreshtha |first=Surendra N. |title=Climate Change, Prairie Agriculture and Prairie Economy: The new normal |journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=March 2011 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there are many different possible impacts—both positive and negative—that may result from climate change affecting global regions in different ways.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite report |editor-first1=Donald S. |editor-last1=Lemmen |editor-first2=Fiona J. |editor-last2=Warren |title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2004 |isbn= 0-662-33123-0 |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/27428.pdf}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food scarcity===
Food scarcity is a major key for many populations and is one of the prominent concerns with the changing climate. Currently, 1/6 of the [[global population]] are without adequate food supply.&lt;ref name=Beddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beddington |first=John R. |last2=Asaduzzaman |first2=Mohammed |last3=Clark |first3=Megan E. |last4=Bremauntz |first4=Adrian Fernández |last5=Guillou |first5=Marion D |last6=Jahn |first6=Molly M. |last7=Lin |first7=Erda |last8=Mamo |first8=Tekalign |last9=Negra |first9=Christine |last10=Nobre |first10=Carlos A. |last11=Scholes |first11=Robert J. |last12=Sharma |first12=Rita |last13=Van Bo |first13=Nguyen |last14=Wakhungu |first14=Judi |display-authors=3 |title=The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change |journal=Agriculture &amp; Food Security |year=2012 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10 |doi=10.1186/2048-7010-1-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 9 billion requiring global food productions to increase by 50% to meet population demand.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chakraborty |first=S. |last2=Newton |first2=A.

===Extreme weather===

====Rising temperatures====
As the [[temperature]] changes and weather patterns become more extreme, areas which were historically good for farmland will no longer be as amicable.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Jeffery D. |last2=Schwabe |first2=Kurt |last3=King |first3=Darran |last4=Knapp |first4=Keith |title=Irrigated agriculture and climate change: The influence of water supply variability and salinity on adaptation |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=May 2012 |volume=77 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sindhu |first=J.S. |title=Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |journal=Indian Journal of Science and Technology |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=348–353 |issn=0974-6846 |url=http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/view/29998/25953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major [[arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions ([[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Southwest United States]], and [[Southern Europe]]).&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tubiello&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Rosenzweig |first2=Cynthia |title=Developing climate change impact metrics for agriculture |journal=The Integrated Assessment Journal |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pp=165–184 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/276/240}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, crop yields in [[tropical regions]] will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2&amp;nbsp;°C) expected to occur during the first half of the century.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Soussana |first2=Jean-François |first3= S.

There are, however, some positive possible aspects to climate change as well. The projected increase in temperature during the first half of the century (1-3&amp;nbsp;°C) is expected to benefit crop and pasture yields in the [[temperate region]]s.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Van der Velde"&gt;{{cite report |last=Tubiello |first=F.N. |last2=van der Velde |first2=M. |title=Land and water use options for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture |work=SOLAW Background Thematic Report - TR04A |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/solaw/files/thematic_reports/TR_04a_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer [[growing season]], increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;

====Drought and flood====
Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of [[droughts]] and [[floods]]. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristjanson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristjanson |first=Patti |last2=Neufeldt |first2=Henry |last3=Gassner |first3=Anja |last4=Mango |first4=Joash |last5=Kyazze |first5=Florence B. |last6=Desta |first6=Solomon |last7=Sayula |first7=George |last8=Thiede |first8=Brian |last9=Förch |first9=Wiebke |last10=Thornton |first10=Pphilip K. |last11=Coe |first11=Richard |display-authors=3 |title=Are food insecure smallholder households making changes in their farming practices? Evidence from East Africa |journal=Food Security |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=381–397 |doi=10.1007/s12571-012-0194-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt; The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this [[historical method]] of weed control will no longer be possible.&lt;ref name=Rod10&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

===Financial===
Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.

===Pests and pathogens===
Currently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;

Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.&lt;ref name=Rod11&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D. E. |title=Challenges for weed management in African rice systems in a changing climate |journal=[[The Journal of Agricultural Science]] |date=August 2011 |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=427–435 |doi=10.1017/S0021859611000207|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/69596 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like [[aphids]], [[whiteflies]] and [[locusts]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse [[weed]]s over the [[monocropping|monocrops]] most farms consist of.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt; Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Characteristics of weeds such as their [[genetic diversity]], cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; Finally, with the increased {{CO2}} levels, [[herbicides]] will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;

==Impact on nutrition==
	Another area of concern is the effect of climate change on the nutritional content of food for human consumption. Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Of significant concern is the [[protein]] content of plants, which also decreases in relation to elevating carbon content.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taub |first=Daniel R. |last2=Miller |first2=Brian |last3=Allen |first3=Holly |title=Effects of elevated {{CO2}} on the protein concentration of food crops: a meta-analysis |journal=[[Global Change Biology]] |date=March 2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01511.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of [[essential nutrients]] in crops contributes the problem of [[micronutrient malnutrition]] in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.&lt;ref name=Loladze&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loladze |first=Irakli |title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=1 October 2002 |volume=17 |pages=457–461 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in [[calories]], [[fat]]s, and animal products. This results in [[undernutrition]] and an increase in [[obesity]] and diet-related [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt;
	
Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. [[Iron deficiency]] affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing [[maternal mortality]] and hindering [[cognitive development]] in children, leading to education losses. [[Iodine deficiency]] leads to ailments like [[goitre]], [[brain damage]] and [[cretinism]] and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt; Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.
	
It must also be noted that small increases in {{CO2}} levels can cause a {{CO2}} fertilization effect where the growth and reproduction abilities of [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants such as soybeans and [[rice]] are actually enhanced by 10-20% in laboratory experiments. This does not take into account, however, the additional burden of pests, pathogens, nutrients and water affecting the crop yield.&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Peter J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Scott N. |last3=Newton |first3=Adrian C. |last4=Ingram |first4=John S.I. |title=Integrating pests and pathogens into the climate change/food security debate |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2009 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=2827–2838 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp080|pmid=19380424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation and mitigation strategies==
While researchers acknowledge there are possible [[benefits of global warming]], most agree that the negative consequences of climate change will outweigh any potential benefits and instead the shifting climate will result in more benefits to developed countries and more detriments to developing countries; exacerbating the discrepancy between wealthy and impoverished nations.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer &amp; Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;  By thoughtful and proactive efforts, climate change can be mitigated by addressing these issues with a [[multidisciplinary approach]] that works on a [[Earth|global]], [[nation]]al and [[community]] basis that recognizes the uniqueness of each country's situation.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; 
	
According to a study of [[East Africa]]’s smallholder farms, impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being seen there resulting in changes to farming practices such as [[intercropping]], crop, soil, land, water and livestock management systems, and introduction of new technologies and seed varieties by some of the farmers.&lt;ref name="Kristjanson"/&gt; Some other suggestions such as eliminating [[supply chain]] and household food waste, encouraging diverse and vegetable-rich diets, and providing global access to foods ([[food aid]] programs) have been suggested as ways to adapt.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Many researchers agree that agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate [[fertilization]] use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI&gt;{{cite report |last=Nelson |first=Gerald C. |first2=Mark W. |last2=Rosegrant |first3=Jawoo |last3=Koo |first4=Richard |last4=Robertson |first5=Timothy |last5=Sulser |first6=Tingju |last6=Zhu |first7=Claudia |last7=Ringler |first8=Siwa |last8=Msangi |first9=Amanda |last9=Palazzo |first10=Miroslav |last10=Batka |first11=Marilia |last11=Magalhaes |first12=Rowena |last12=Valmonte-Santos |first13=Mandy |last13=Ewing |first14=David |last14=Lee |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation |publisher=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] |date= October 2009 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a government and global level, research and investments into [[agricultural productivity]] and [[infrastructure]] must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them. [[Government policies]] and programs must provide environmentally sensitive government [[subsidies]], educational campaigns and economic incentives as well as funds, [[insurance]] and safety nets for vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI/&gt;  In addition, providing [[early warning systems]], and accurate [[weather forecasts]] to poor or remote areas will allow for better preparation; by using and sharing the available technology, the global issue of climate change can be addressed and mitigated by the global community.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

==Oceans and human health==

===Overview===
Perhaps one of the most recent adverse [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to be explored is that of [[ocean acidification]]. Our [[oceans]] cover approximately 71 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and support a diverse range of [[ecosystems]], which are home to over 50 percent of all the [[species]] on the planet.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web |title=Oceans &amp; Coasts |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.noaa.gov/oceans-coasts |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans regulate [[climate]] and [[weather]] as well as providing [[nutrition]] for a vast variety of species, humans included.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] from the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=raven99&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Raven |first=J.A. |last2=Falkowski |first2=P.G. |date=June 1999 |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric {{co2}} |journal=[[Plant, Cell &amp; Environment]] | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=741–755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is part of the [[carbon cycle]] in which the fluxes of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in Earth's [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]] and [[lithosphere]] are described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Cycle |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=29 Nov 2012 |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9020247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have drastically added to the amount of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in the atmosphere through the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the process of [[deforestation]]. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].

===Coral===
With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.&lt;ref name="atoll"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88–89|pages=76–84|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328–1332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="atoll" /&gt; In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.&lt;ref name="child" /&gt; Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low-lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.

===Human health===
The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans. According to Small and Nicholls, they estimated that 1.2 billion people worldwide, lived in the near-coastal region (within 100&amp;nbsp;km and 100m of the shoreline).&lt;ref name=settle&gt;{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Christopher |last2=Nicholls |first2=Robert J. |title=A Global Analysis of Human Settlement in Coastal Zones |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |date=Summer 2003 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=584–599 |jstor=4299200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data was collected in 1990 and therefore is a conservative estimate in modern terms. In the U.S. alone 53% of the population lives within 50 miles of the coastal shoreline.&lt;ref name=grass&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delorenzo |first=Marie E. |last2=Wallace |first2=Sarah C. |last3=Danese |first3=Loren E. |last4=Baird |first4=Thomas D. |title=Temperature and Salinity effects on the toxicity of common pesticides to the grass shrimp, ''Palaemonetes pugio'' |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=455–460 |doi=10.1080/03601230902935121|pmid=20183050 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234438 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans rely heavily on oceans for food, employment, recreation, weather patterns and transportation.&lt;ref name=guest&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sandifer |first=Paul A. |first2=A.

===Food safety===
Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].&lt;ref name=pseudo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tatters |first=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;

==Extreme weather events==
Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

===Drought===
Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.
A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.
During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S–181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.&lt;ref name=alderman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alderman |first=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37–47 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt; Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.&lt;ref&gt;thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

Non-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

=== Hurricanes ===
Another result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Storms and Sickness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=161–178|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions" /&gt; [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

===Glacial melting===
A [[glacier]] is a mass of ice that has originated from snow that has been compacted via pressure and have definite lateral limits and movements in definite directions.&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinn|first=T.J.|date=2001|title=Distribution of the glacial water resources of New Zealand|url=http://hydrologynz.co.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=139–187}}&lt;!-- removed from ref, these point to a different article: {{|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90093-3 |bibcode=1979JHyd...40..139C}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in areas where the temperatures do not get warm enough to melt annual snow accumulation, thus resulting in many layers of snow piling up over many years, creating the pressure needed to make a glacier.  [[Global climate change]] and fluctuation is causing an increasingly exponential melting of Earth's glaciers.  These melting glaciers have many [[social]] and [[ecological]] consequences that directly or indirectly impact the health and well-being of humans.&lt;ref name=Orlove&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orlove |first=Ben |title=Glacier Retreat: Reviewing the Limits of Human Adaptation to Climate Change |journal=Environment |year=2009 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=22–34 |doi=10.3200/envt.51.3.22-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recession of glaciers change [[sea salt]], [[sediment]], and temperature ratios in the ocean which changes currents, weather patterns, and marine life.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite book |title=Changing Planet, changing health |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn=978-0520269095 |author1=Epstein, P. |author2=Ferber, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The melt also [[ocean levels|increases ocean levels]] and decreases the [[Water resources|availability of water]] for human consumption, agriculture, and hydroelectricity.  This aggravates and increases the likelihood of issues such as sanitation,  [[world hunger]], population shifts, and [[Extreme weather|catastrophic weather]] such as flooding, drought, and worldwide temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Glacial retreat first gained the attention of alpinists and the tourist industry shortly after 1940 – when the globe warmed ~0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Even with 62 years of awareness, [[climate change]] is just becoming an issue for some parts of society. Over this time period the [[alpine glaciers|cirque and steep alpine glaciers]] were able to [[acclimatize]] to the new temperatures posed by climate change; large [[valley glacier]]s have not yet made this adjustment. This means the large valley glaciers are rapidly retreating, as their mass is attempting to achieve equilibrium with the current climate.  If regional [[snow line]]s stay constant, then the glaciers remain constant.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Today this is clearly not the case as global warming is causing mountain snow lines to rapidly retreat.  Even the United States’ famous [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] is receding.  More than two-thirds of its glaciers have disappeared and it is expected for them to be nonexistent in the park by the year 2030.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Myrna H.P. |last2=Fagre |first2=Daniel B. |title=Modeled Climate Change in Glacier National Park, 1850-2100 |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=131 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0131:mcigci]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial melt will affect [[Coastal wetland|low-lying coastal wetlands]] via [[sea level rise]], change key drivers of [[fresh-water ecosystem]]s, shift the timing of snow packs, and alter the unique character of associated fresh water streams off of snow pack.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.M. |last1=Jenkins |last2=Kingsford |first2=R.T. |last3=Closs |first3=G.P. |last4=Wolfenden |first4=B.J. |last5=Matthaei |first5=C.D. |last6=Hay |first6=S.E. |display-authors=3 |title=Climate change and freshwater ecosystems in Oceania: an assessment of vulnerability and adaption opportunities |journal=[[Pacific Conservation Biology]] |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=201–219 |doi=10.1071/PC110201 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=PC110201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been stated that the sea level will rise 28–43&amp;nbsp;cm by 2100;&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; if all the ice on Earth melts, it is predicted that the ocean level will increase 75 meters, destroying many coastal cities.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  In addition, the freshwater swaps in northern areas are already affected by the intrusion of salt water. “Sea level rise will cause a change of state from freshwater to marine or [[Estuarine|estuarine ecosystems]], radically altering the composition of [[Biotic community|biotic communities]]".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

Not only are glaciers causing a rise in sea level, they are causing an increase in [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ESNO) and global temperature itself.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt;  Glacier loss adds to global heat rise through a decrease in what is called [[ice-albedo feedback]].  As more ice melts, there is less [[Solar reflectance|solar reflectivity]] and less heat is reflected away from the Earth, causing more heat to be absorbed, and retained in the atmosphere and soil &lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; In addition to the El Niño events, glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of [[sea surface temperatures]] &lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the [[Atlantic conveyor belt|Atlantic conveyor belt's]] usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant, cold, fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;  Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  “In many parts of the world, disappearing [[mountain glacier]]s and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

==Deforestation==
===Effects of deforestation in the African Highlands===
 [[Image:Ethiopian highlands 01 mod.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Ethiopian Highlands]]]]

Environmental changes such as deforestation could increase local temperatures in the highlands thus could enhance the vectorial capacity of the [[anopheles]].&lt;ref name=Afrane&gt;{{cite journal |last=Afrane |first=Y.

Environmental changes, [[climate variability]], and climate change are such factors that could affect biology and ecology of Anophelse [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] and their [[disease transmission]] potential.&lt;ref name=Afrane/&gt; Climate change is expected to lead to latitudinal and altitudinal temperature increases. Global warming projections indicate that the best estimate of surface air warming for a “high scenario” is 4 C, with a likely range of 2.4-6.4 C by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |location=Cambridge |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg2_report_impacts_adaptation_and_vulnerability.htm |author=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temperature increase of this size would alter the biology and the ecology of many mosquito vectors and the dynamics of the diseases they transmit such as malaria. Anopheles mosquitoes in highland areas are to experience a larger shift in their metabolic rate due to the climate change. This climate change is due to the deforestation in the highland areas where these mosquitoes dwell. When temperature rises, the [[larvae]] take a shorter time to mature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Munga, S. |author2=Minakawa, N. |author3=Zhou, G. |author4=Githenko, A.K. |author5=Yan, G. |title=Survivorship of Immature Stages of Anopheles gambiae s.l.

In turn this could potentially lead to an increase in malaria transmission when infected humans are available.[[Image:Forest fruits from Barro Colorado.png|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Biodiversity]]]]

===Biodiversity===
[[Deforestation]] is directly linked with a decrease in plant [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=muhammad&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muhammad |first=Ashraf |author2=Hussain, M. |author3=Ahmad, M.S.A |author4=Al-Quariny, F. |author5=Hameed, M. |title=Strategies for conservation of endangered ecosystems |journal=Pakistan Journal of Botany |date=May 2012 |volume=44 |issue=Special Issue |pages=1–6 |url=http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/44(SI2)/01.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health.  One such implication is the loss of [[herbalism|medicinal plants]].  The use of plants for medicinal purposes is extensive, with ~70 to 80% of individuals worldwide relying solely on plant-based medicine as their primary source of healthcare.&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Alan |title=Plant Conservation: An Ecosystem Approach |year=2006 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=9781844070831 |pages=37–39 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This dependency on plants for medicinal purposes is especially rife in [[developing country|developing countries]] that only consume 15% of manufactured pharmaceutical drugs, many of which are fake.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Local knowledge surrounding medicinal plants is useful for screening for new herbal medicines that may be useful for treating disease.&lt;ref name=mirsanjari&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirsanjari |first=Mir Mehrdad |author2=Mirsanjari, Mitra. |title=The role of biodiversity for sustainable environment |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development |date=May 2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=71–86 |ssrn=2054975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Villages and communities which reside continually in a single geographic area over time, create, transmit and apply widespread information surrounding the medicinal resources in the area.&lt;ref name=mirsanjari/&gt; Formal scientific methods have been useful in identifying the active ingredients used in [[ethnopharmacy]] and applying them to modern medicines.  However, it is important that medicinal resources are managed appropriately as they become globally traded in order to prevent [[endangered species|species endangerment]].&lt;ref name=mirsanjari/&gt;

===Mountain pine beetle, forest ecosystems and forest fires===
[[Image:Dendroctonus ponderosae.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Adult mountain pine beetle]]

Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the [[mountain pine beetle]] (MPB). This is because temperature is a factor which determines insect development and population success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sambaraju |first=Kishan R. |last2=Carroll |first2=Allan L. |last3=Zhu |first3=Jun |last4=Stahl |first4=Kerstin |last5=Moore |first5=R.

It is a simple relationship between a [[host (biology)|host]] (the forest), an [[Biological agent|agent]] (the beetle) and the [[Natural environment|environment]] (the weather &amp; temperature).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, as climate change causes mountain areas to become warmer and drier, pine beetles have more power to infest and destroy the forest ecosystems, such as the whitebark pine forests of the Rockies.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This is a forest so important to forest ecosystems that it is called the “rooftop of the rockies”. Climate change has led to a threatening pine beetle [[pandemic]], causing them to spread far beyond their native habitat. This leads to [[ecosystem]] changes, [[forest fires]], [[floods]] and hazards to human [[health]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark pine ecosystem in these high elevations plays many essential roles, providing support to plant and animal life.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They provide food for [[grizzly bears]] and [[squirrels]], as well as shelter and breeding grounds for [[elk]] and [[deer]]; protects [[Drainage divide|watersheds]] by sending water to parched foothills and plains; serves as a reservoir by dispensing supplies of water from melted snowpacks that are trapped beneath the shaded areas; and creates new soil which allows for growth of other trees and plant species.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Without these pines, animals do not have adequate food, water, or shelter, and the reproductive life cycle, as well as quality of life, is affected as a consequence.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Normally, the pine beetle cannot survive in these frigid temperatures and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, warmer temperatures means that the pine beetle can now survive and attack these forests, as it no longer is cold enough to freeze and kill the beetle at such elevations.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Increased temperatures also allow the pine beetle to increase their life cycle by 100%: it only takes a single year instead of two for the pine beetle to develop. As the Rockies have not adapted to deal with pine beetle [[infestations]], they lack the defenses to fight the beetles.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Warmer [[weather patterns]], [[drought]], and beetle defense mechanisms together dries out [[sap]] in [[pine trees]], which is the main mechanism of defense that trees have against the beetle, as it drowns the beetles and their eggs.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This makes it easier for the beetle to infest and release chemicals into the tree, luring other beetles in an attempt to overcome the weakened defense system of the pine tree. As a consequence, the host (forest) becomes more vulnerable to the disease-causing agent (the beetle).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark forests of the Rockies are not the only forests that have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the “lungs of the Earth”.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]]. [[Forest fires]] present dangers to the environment, human health and the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They are detrimental to [[air quality]] and [[vegetation]], releasing [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] compounds as they burn.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Due to human induced [[deforestation]] and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting [[diseases]] can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, [[insect]] infestations, forest diebacks, [[acid rain]], habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

===Smoke from wildfires===

==Displacement/migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People |work=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref name=bogumil&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Bogumil |last=Terminski |title=Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges |publisher=Centre d'Etude de l'Ethnicité et des Migrations, Université de Liège |date=2012 |url=http://labos.ulg.ac.be/cedem/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.&lt;ref name="beta"&gt;{{cite report|title=Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=2012 |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-06 |isbn=978-92-9092-611-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure
development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants&amp;nbsp;– particularly low-skilled ones&amp;nbsp;– are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.&lt;ref name="beta" /&gt;

The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.&lt;ref name=bogumil/&gt; This situates the debate on [[environmental migrant|environmental migration]] in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the [[UNHCR]] who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.&lt;ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology"&gt;{{cite report |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality? |series=New Issues in Refugee Research |id=Working Paper No. 34 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[The Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1244">'''Global Cosmopolitans''' refers to "a talented population of highly educated [[multilingual]] people that have lived, worked and studied for extensive periods in different cultures. While their international identities have diverse starting points and experiences, their views of the world and themselves are profoundly affected by both the realities of living in different cultures and their manner of coping with the challenges that emerge.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brimm|first1=Linda|title=Global Cosmopolitans, The Creative Edge of Difference|date=2010|publisher=Insead Business Press Series, Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0230230781|pages=4|url=https://www.amazon.com/Global-Cosmopolitans-Creative-Difference-Business/dp/0230230784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was developed by Linda Brimm, Professor of [[Organizational Behavior]] at [[INSEAD]] and further explored in her book ''[https://www.amazon.com/Global-Cosmopolitans-Creative-Difference-Business/dp/0230230784 Global Cosmopolitans: The Creative Edge of Difference]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6401">The '''Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health''' was a program of the [[United Nations]] (UN) directed at improving women's and children's health in the developing world.

The program was announced by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEjj_XD4L21sQLY3DEogHXxLXQHAD9ICPTGG0|title=UN promotes health campaign for women, children|last=Snow|first=Anita|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The objective of the program was to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11392954|title=UN launches $40bn woman and child health plan|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4, 5 and 6 were showing the slowest rate of progression, this program was also instituted to gain momentum in achieving them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/node/8936/pdf/ewec_progress_report_final_3.pdf|title=Saving Lives Protecting Futures: Progress Report on the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health 2010-2015|work=Resource Centre|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the program was led by the [[World Health Organization]], reporting to the UN.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-governments-pledge|title=Millennium development goals: governments pledge £25.5bn to eradicate world poverty|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|author2=Curtis, Polly|date=22 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68L1K820100922|title=U.N. chief to launch women, children health drive|last=Worsnip|first=Patrick|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International aid group [[Oxfam]] expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

== Progress: 2010-2015 ==
The Global Strategy managed to improve the coordination of global efforts towards the improvement of women’s and children’s health as well as enhancing strategies to tackle this. It gave rise to the “Every Woman Every Child” movement, which assisted in the mobilisation of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite not reaching targets, reductions in both child and [[Maternal Mortality|maternal mortality]] were noted; of 49% and 45% respectively from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Temmerman|first=Marleen|last2=Khosla|first2=Rajat|last3=Bhutta|first3=Zulfiqar A.|last4=Bustreo|first4=Flavia|date=2015-09-14|title=Towards a new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4414|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4414|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4414|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26371228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.4 million maternal and child deaths were prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, [[oral rehydration therapy]] and exclusive breastfeeding coverage showed the most significant improvement, however, progress in [[vaccination]] and [[pneumonia]] was still lagging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also reported increased collaboration with the private sector, with an increase in donor funding of US$19.8 billion noted from September 2010 to May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-2015 ==
The Global Health Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents 2016-2030 was launched in September 2015, building on experience gained from 2010-2015, with the inclusion of adolescents as an additional target group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is aligned with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and has 3 main objectives; namely for women, adolescents and children to "survive", "thrive" and "transform".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuruvilla|first=Shyama|last2=Bustreo|first2=Flavia|last3=Kuo|first3=Taona|last4=Mishra|first4=CK|last5=Taylor|first5=Katie|last6=Fogstad|first6=Helga|last7=Gupta|first7=Geeta Rao|last8=Gilmore|first8=Kate|last9=Temmerman|first9=Marleen|date=2016-05-01|title=TheGlobal strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016–2030): a roadmap based on evidence and country experience|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=94|issue=5|pages=398–400|doi=10.2471/blt.16.170431|issn=0042-9686|pmc=4850541|pmid=27147772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evidence-based, multi-sectoral approach and emphasises the need to address equity, with interventions applied across the life-course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/ewec-globalstrategyreport-200915.pdf|title=The Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">'''Global apartheid''' is a term used to mean [[minority rule]] in international decision-making. The term comes from [[apartheid]], the system of governmental that ruled [[South Africa]] until 27 April 1994 when people of all races were able to vote as equals for the first time.

The concept of global apartheid has been developed by many researchers, including [[Titus Alexander]], [[Bruno Amoroso]], [[Patrick Bond]], [[Gernot Kohler]], [[Arjun Makhijiani]], [[Ali Mazuri]], [[Vandana Shiva]], Anthony H. Richmond, [[Joseph Nevins]], [[Muhammed Asadi]], [[Gustav Fridolin]], and many others.&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander"&gt;Titus Alexander, Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics, Polity Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Amoroso, Global Apartheid.

Asadi, Global Apartheid, iUniverse, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per Gustav Edvard Fridolin,  Från Vittsjö till världen - om global apartheid och alla vi som vill någon annanstans (From Vittsjö to the world - about global apartheid and everyone of us that want to go somewhere), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and use ==
The first use of the term may have been by Gernot Koehler in a 1978 Working Paper for the [[World Order Models Project]].  In 1995 Koehler develop this in ''The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential''.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 20, No. 3 (July-September 1995), pp. 403-413&lt;/ref&gt;

Its best known use was by [[Thabo Mbeki]], then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons of the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.&lt;ref&gt;Haviland, William (1993). Cultural Anthropology. Vermont: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers. p. 250-252&lt;/ref&gt;  Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of [[Charter 99]], a campaign for [[democratic mundialization|global democracy]], who was also present at the UN [[Millennium Summit]] and gave him a copy of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid''.

== Concept ==
Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa ''civilized labour'' policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of immigrants seeking work.

At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system ([[Bank of International Settlements]]), [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[Security Council]] and other institutions of global governance.  The [[G8]] represent less than 15% of world population, yet have over 60% of its income.  80% of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and [[WTO]] and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).  By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European.  Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority.

In ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', [[Samuel P. Huntington]] describes how "the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P Huntington The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, (p81)&lt;/ref&gt;  Huntington quoted Jeffrey R Bennett to claim that Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey R Bennett ‘Exclusion as National Security Policy’, Parameters, 24, Spring 1994, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

* own and operate the international banking system
* control all hard currencies
* are the world’s principle customer
* provide the majority of the world’s finished goods
* dominate international capital markets
* exert considerable moral leadership within many societies
* are capable of massive military intervention
* control the sea lanes

Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ [p308]

Alexander identifies numerous ''pillars of global apartheid'' including:&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander" /&gt;
*veto power by the Western minority in the UN [[Security Council]] 
*voting powers in the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]]
*dominance of the [[World Trade Organization]] through effective veto power and ‘weight of trade’ rather than formal voting power
*one-sided rules of trade, which give privileged protection to Western agriculture and other interests while opening markets in the Majority World
*protection of ‘hard currency’ through the central banking system through the [[Bank of International Settlements]] 
*immigration controls which manage the flow of labour to meet the needs of Western economies 
*use of aid and investment to control elites in the Majority World through reward and punishment 
*support for coups or military intervention in countries which defy Western dominance

International decision-making has a legacy of [[international inequality|inequality]] which some authors{{Who|date=September 2015}} have compared to historical [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]].

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]].

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant.

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them.

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===

{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme''' was set up by the [[World Health Organization]] and major publishers to enable developing countries to access collections of biomedical and health literature. There are up to 13,000 e-journals and up to 29,000 online books available to health institutions in more than 100 countries. HINARI is part of Research4Life, the collective name for four programs - HINARI (focusing on health), [[AGORA]] (focusing on agriculture), [[OARE]] (focusing on environment), and [[ARDI]] (focusing on applied science and technology).&lt;ref name= "LancetR4L"&gt;{{cite web |title= Our commitment to universal access to medical research § About Research4Life |url= http://www.thelancet.com/hinari |publisher= ''[[The Lancet]]'' |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Research4Life provides developing countries with free or low cost access to academic and professional peer-reviewed content online.&lt;ref name= "LancetR4L"/&gt;

The HINARI program, and the other programs, were reviewed for the second time in 2010 and the publishers involved have committed to continuing with it until at least 2020. HINARI has received the high honor of the [[Medical Library Association]]'s 2015 Louise Darling Medal for Collection Development in the Health Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.medicine.yale.edu/blog/mla-awards-2015-louise-darling-medal-yale-partner-hinari|title=MLA awards 2015 Louise Darling Medal to Yale partner HINARI|last=Hickner|first=Andy|website=The Cushing/Whitney Medical Library|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In response to a call by the then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and to a statement issued by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] the then Director General World Health Organization, HINARI was launched in July 2001 with a statement of intent from six major publishers: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], [[Elsevier]], the [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]], [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[Springer Science+Business Media]], and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name= "intent"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/statementofintent/en/ |title= Publishers' Statement of Intent |date= 2001-07-09 |location= London |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HINARI name began as an acronym of Health Inter-Network Access to Research Initiative.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; The use of the full name was later abandoned.  The program opened for use in January 2002 with around 1,500 journals from the initial six publishers.&lt;ref name= "Harris2007"/&gt; {{As of|2015}}, there are almost 200 publisher partners providing their online publications through HINARI.&lt;ref name= "partners"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://extranet.who.int/hinari/en/partners.php?category=publisher |title= Partners § Publishers |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,750 journal titles were accessible via HINARI in 2007.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; Critiques of HINARI argue that the low-cost model is still too high for many institutions and journals with top [[impact factor]]s are not included in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Villafuerte-Gálvez|first=Javier|last2=Curioso|first2=Walter H|last3=Gayoso|first3=Oscar|title=Biomedical Journals and Global Poverty: Is HINARI a Step Backwards?|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040220|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=4|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040220|pmc=1896213|pmid=17594171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Eligible categories of institutions are: national universities, professional schools (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, dentistry), research institutes, teaching hospitals and healthcare centers, government offices, national medical libraries and local non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name= "eligibility"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/index.html |title= Eligibility |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
The country lists are based on four factors: Total GNI (World Bank figures), GNI per capita (World Bank figures), United Nations Least Developed Country (LDCs) List and Human Development Index (HDI).&lt;ref name= "criteria"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/Details_eligibility/en/ |title= Criteria by which countries, areas, or territories are categorized |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 users and members of eligible institutions in 113 countries had access.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; In 2016, the number of eligible countries, areas and territories stood at 117.&lt;ref name= "eligibility"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some large, emerging countries including [[India]] and [[China]] are excluded by the program because their total GNI exceeds US$1 trillion.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sarin |first= R |year= 2007 |title= Denying open access to published health-care research: WHO has the password? |journal= [[Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics]] |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages = 133–4 |doi= 10.4103/0973-1482.37403 |pmid= 18079573 |url= http://www.cancerjournal.net/text.asp?2007/3/3/133/37403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harris2007"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=136 |title= Training increases HINARI and AGORA benefits |magazine= Research Information |publisher= Europa Science |department= Digital Divide |date= June–July 2007 |last= Harris |first= Siân |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12228">'''Health human resources''' ('''HHR''') – also known as '''human resources for health''' ('''HRH''') or '''health workforce''' – is defined as "all people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health", according to the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2006'']].&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. ''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, 2006 – http://www.who.int/whr/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Human resources for health are identified as one of the core building blocks of a [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/en/index.html Health Systems Topics.] Geneva. &lt;/ref&gt; They include [[physicians]], [[nurses|nursing professionals]], [[midwives]], [[dentists]], [[allied health professions]], [[community health worker]]s, social health workers and other [[health care provider]]s, as well as health management and support personnel – those who may not deliver services directly but are essential to effective health system functioning, including [[health administration|health services managers]], [[health information management|medical records and health information technicians]], health economists, health supply chain managers, medical secretaries and others. 

The field of health human resources deals with issues such as [[workforce planning|planning]], development, performance, [[human resource management|management]], [[employee retention|retention]], information, and research on [[human resources]] for the [[health care]] sector. In recent years, raising awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the [[global health]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Grepin K, Savedoff WD. "10 Best Resources on ... health workers in developing countries." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2009; 24(6):479–482 http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/6/479&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global situation ==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of health care workers]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and support workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt; The shortage is most severe in 57 of the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The situation was declared on [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2006]] as a "health workforce crisis" – the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, [[wage]]s, working environment and management. 

Shortages of skilled for health workers are also reported in many specific care areas. For example, there is an estimated shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000 nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries''. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011 – available on http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of [[birth attendant|skilled birth attendants]] in many developing countries remains an important barrier to improving [[maternal health]] outcomes. Many countries, both developed and developing, report maldistribution of skilled health workers leading to [[Health care provider#Shortages of health professionals|shortages in rural and underserved areas]].

Regular statistical updates on the global health workforce situation are collated in the WHO ''Global Health Observatory''.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/gho/health_workforce/en/ ''Global Health Observatory (GHO) data: Health workforce.''] Geneva. Accessed 8 Aug 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence base remains fragmented and incomplete, largely related to weaknesses in the underlying [[HRHIS|human resource information systems]] (HRIS) within countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. (eds). ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health'', Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009 – available on http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to learn from best practices in addressing health workforce challenges and strengthening the evidence base, an increasing number of HHR practitioners from around the world are focusing on issues such as HHR advocacy, surveillance and collaborative practice. Some examples of global HRH partnerships include:
* [http://my.ibpinitiative.org/HIRG Health Workforce Information Reference Group (HIRG)]
* [http://www.who.int/hrh/network/en/ Global Health Workforce Network]

== Research ==
Health workforce research is the investigation of how social, economic, organizational, political and policy factors affect access to health care professionals, and how the organization and composition of the workforce itself can affect health care delivery, quality, [[health equity|equity]], and costs. 

Many government [[health department]]s, academic institutions and related agencies have established research programs to identify and quantify the scope and nature of HHR problems leading to [[health policy]] in building an innovative and sustainable health services workforce in their jurisdiction. Some examples of HRH information and research dissemination programs include:

* [http://www.human-resources-health.com ''Human Resources for Health''] journal

== Policy and planning ==
In some countries and jurisdictions, health workforce planning is distributed among [[Labour economics|labour market]] participants. In others, there is an explicit [[health policy|policy or strategy]] adopted by governments and systems to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet health care goals. For one, the [[International Council of Nurses]] reports:&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Nurses. ''Health human resources planning''. Geneva, 2008 – {{cite web |url=http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161502/http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of HHRP [health human resources planning] is to provide the right number of health care workers with the right knowledge, skills, attitudes, and qualifications, performing the right tasks in the right place at the right time to achieve the right predetermined health targets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An essential component of planned HRH targets is [[supply and demand]] modeling, or the use of appropriate data to link population health needs and/or health care delivery targets with human resources supply, distribution and [[workforce productivity|productivity]]. The results are intended to be used to generate evidence-based policies to guide workforce sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.'' Geneva, World Health Organization, 2010 – http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/hhr-rhs/strateg/index-eng.php ''Health Human Resource Strategy (HHRS)''.] Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In resource-limited countries, HRH planning approaches are often driven by the needs of targeted programmes or projects, for example, those responding to the [[Millennium Development Goals]] or, more recently, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreesch N et al. "An approach to estimating human resource requirements to achieve the Millennium Development Goals." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2005; 20(5):267–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need'' (WISN) is an HRH planning and management tool that can be adapted to local circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN): User's manual.'' Geneva, 2010 – http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/wisn_user_manual/en/ &lt;/ref&gt; It provides health managers a systematic way to make staffing decisions in order to better manage their human resources, based on a health worker's [[workload]], with activity (time) standards applied for each workload component at a given health facility.

===Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel===
The main international policy framework for addressing shortages and maldistribution of health professionals is the ''Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel'', adopted by the WHO's 63rd [[World Health Assembly]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''International recruitment of health personnel: global code of practice.'' Resolution adopted by the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Geneva, May 2010 – available on http://apps.who.int/gb/e/e_wha63.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was developed in a context of increasing debate on international health worker recruitment, especially in some higher income countries, and its impact on the ability of many developing countries to deliver [[primary health care]] services. Although non-binding on the Member States and recruitment agencies, the Code promotes principles and practices for the ethical international recruitment of health personnel. It also advocates the strengthening of health personnel information systems to support effective health workforce policies and planning in countries.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''Hyper-globalization''' is a term used to describe the dramatic change in the size, scope and velocity of globalization that began in the late 1990s and that continues into the beginning of the 21st century. It covers all three main dimensions of [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]], and [[political globalization]]. The term appeared in the 2011 work by [[Dani Rodrik]] an economist and professor of International Political Economy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who used the term in his ''The Globalization Paradox: Democracy and the Future of the World Economy''. Rodrik used the term as a criticism of state of globalization, questioning the wisdom of unlimited economic integration beyond national borders. He sees a conflict between the workings of the nation state and free flow economic globalization that has gone too far “toward an impractical version that we might call hyperglobalization.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodrik|first1=Dani|title=The globalization paradox : democracy and the future of the world economy|date=2011|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=9780393071610|pages=200–201|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Arvind Subramanian and Martin Kessler used the term in their ''The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future'', to describe the dramatic increase in world trade that has occurred since the founding of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995.&lt;ref name="Kessler2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin Kessler|author2=Arvind Subramanian|title=The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future|url=https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/hyperglobalization-trade-and-its-future|website=PIIE.Com|publisher=Peterson Institute of International Economics|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was extended beyond economic globalization to include the realms of culture and politics in 2018 by Public Relations consultant and academician, Takashi Inoue. In his ''Public Relations in Hyper-Globalization'' he argues that the world is being transformed by three forces of hyper-globalization: economic, social media, and new disruptive technologies that together are accelerating the pace of change in all spheres. Inoue argues that this is the new reality in which leaders must now operate in.&lt;ref name="Inoue2018HYP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inoue|first1=Takashi|title=Public Relations in Hyper-Globalization: Essential Relationship Management – A Japan Perspective|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1138054967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyper-globalization as globalization gone too far ==
Dani Rodrik defines hyper-globalization as a type of globalization aimed at the elimination of all transaction costs associated with the movement between the natural borders of nation states of goods, services, capital and finance. These costs are not limited to just tariffs and quotas, but also includes things such as domestic regulations, standards, rules on product safety, rules on intellectual property, and banking regulations. In other words, Rodrik sees hyper-globalization as a type of globalization that allows multinational companies to avoid the rules and regulations of nation states. The deep integration of hyper-globalization conflicts with and threatens the sovereignty of the nation state. Rodrik concludes that hyper-globalization is globalization that has gone too far. He rejects the solution of using [[intergovernmental organizations]] as a way to provide governance, because by definition that requires nation states to give up sovereignty and thus it is not compatible with democracy. He does not argue to stop or reduce globalization, but rather to change the rules of globalization away from hyper-globalization to activity that does not conflict with national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Rodrik2016NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodrik|first1=Dani|title=Put Globalization to Work for Democracies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/put-globalization-to-work-for-democracies.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|publisher=The New York Times, Opinion|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyper-globalization’s origins, its size, scope and velocity ==
Subramanian and Kessler argue that the world is now in an era of “hyper-globalization, where world trade has soared much more rapidly than world GDP.” They note that in the period since the late 1990s there was a surge in economic activity in the developing world. Prior to the late 1990s only 30 percent of the developing world or 21 countries out of 72 were catching up to the United States as the economic frontier, but since the late 1990s that number jumped nearly 75 percent or 75 out of 103 countries. The rate at which convergence with the U.S. was occurring jumped from 1.5 percent per capita per year to 3.3 percent per capita after the late 1990s.  They call the period between 1870 and 1914 the Golden Age of globalization in which world trade in terms of GDP went from a 9 percent to 16 percent share. However, in the current age of hyper-globalization, which includes both goods and services, the GDP share has reached 33 percent.They explain that China, which gained entry into the WTO in 2001, has become the world’s sole mega-trader. At the height of the Golden Age of globalization in 1913 Great Britain was the world’s megatrader with its share of GDP of 18.5 percent. In contrast, China’s share of GDP has reached 50%.&lt;ref name="Kessler2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin Kessler|author2=Arvind Subramanian|title=The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future|url=https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/hyperglobalization-trade-and-its-future|website=PIIE.Com|publisher=Peterson Institute of International Economics|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three forces of hyper-globalization  ==

Takashi Inoue describes three forces of hyper-globalization: (1) Economic force in which extensive growth in global trade creates cross-border economic integration, (2) Human communications force via the Internet in which instant and global communication of social media and the Internet are changing norms of human communication blurring social barriers, and (3) Technological disruption force coming from new innovations in technology driven by Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bringing massive economic and rapid social changes leading to a world of Singularity. His main argument is that these three forces are creating a new reality for which global leaders must now be proficient in stakeholder relationship management of strategic public relations.&lt;ref name="Inoue2018HYP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="129752">The '''ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking''' are the objective merit-based method used by the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) for [[single skating|single]] &amp; [[pair skating]] and [[ice dance]], as well as [[synchronized skating]]. Only eligible skaters/teams will be considered in the ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking.

Skaters/teams receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight over the current and preceding two [[Figure skating season|seasons]]. The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking are updated after each eligible events. At the end of the current season, the points from the earliest season are deleted. If pairs and ice dance couples officially split up, their partnership will be removed from the Standings and Ranking. When a skater officially announces his or her retirement from competition, the standing and rank of the skater will be removed.

== Overview ==
The ISU Council had implemented the former world standings system for single &amp; pair skating and ice dance for several seasons before 2010. The world standings system for synchronized skating and the season's world ranking had not been implemented until 2010.

According to the "ISU Communication 1629" and "ISU Communication 1630" published by the ISU on July 21, 2010,&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1630PDF"/&gt; the ISU Council decided to implement two types of World Standings / Ranking, namely "ISU World Standings" and "ISU Season's World Ranking", since the 2010–11 season.

The '''ISU World Standings for single &amp; pair skating and ice dance''', are taking into account results of the preceding two seasons and the current season and remains the basis for the draws at ISU events and part of the criteria for the selection of competitors for the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating]] and other ISU events designated by the ISU Council.

The '''ISU Season's World Ranking''', is based on the results of the current ongoing season only. It has the main purpose to reflect the current competitive performances of the skaters and give the public and the media an indication of the current actual competitiveness of the skaters.

The '''ISU World Standings for synchronized skating''', are taking into account results of the preceding two seasons and the current season. The standings will also guarantee objectivity and a help for the process of individual entries to ISU events. There will be a separate ranking for "Senior" and "Junior".

The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking do not necessarily reflect the capabilities of some skaters/teams. Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters/teams in each country, skaters/teams from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater/team with a lower season's best but from a country with few high-level skaters/teams may qualify to a major event while a skater/team with a much higher season's best but from a country with more than three high-level skaters/teams may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater/team who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.

== Principles ==
Since the introduction of the world standings system, the method used to calculate the standing points of a skater has changed several times.

=== Points distribution (since the 2010–11 season) ===
==== For single &amp; pair skating and ice dance ====
According to the "ISU Communication 1629" published by the ISU on July 21, 2010,&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt; the ''world standing'' of a skater is calculated based on the results over the current and preceding two seasons. Competitors receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event's weight. The following events receive points:
* ISU Championships ([[World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]], [[European Figure Skating Championships|Europeans]], [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents]], and [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|Junior Worlds]]) and [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]]: The best result by points per season, the best two results by points over three seasons.
* [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|ISU Grand Prix]] and [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Final]], [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] and [[ISU Junior Grand Prix Final|Final]]: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over three seasons.
* International senior calendar competitions: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over three seasons.

Current and intermediate season's earned points will count 100%, and previous season's earned points will count 70%. Following the current season's World Championships, the results from the earliest season are deleted. A new partnership starts with zero points — there is no transfer of world standing points if pairs or ice dance couples split up and form a new partnership, and the previous partnership will be removed from the World Standings. When a skater officially announces his or her retirement from competition, the standing of the skater will be removed.

The ''season's world ranking'' of a skater is calculated similarly to the overall world standing but is based on the results of the ongoing season only.&lt;ref name="ISU1629PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISU1629archived"/&gt;

The ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking order will be updated after each event mentioned in the following table. Only eligible skaters will be considered in the ISU World Standings and Season's World Ranking.

Established in 2008 by Nathan Taback, Christina Willie and Robin Coupland, '''Insecurity Insight''' is a [[Geneva]]-based non-profit organisation that has developed the ”Taback-Coupland model of armed violence”, a model that is used to generate data on the impact of armed [[violence]] and insecurity on people's lives and wellbeing with a view to generating preventive policies.

==History==
While working in conflict zones as a [[general surgeon]] treating war wounds (1987-1995), Coupland developed a [[theory]] about armed violence and its effects. The theory states that the effects of use of [[weapons]] on [[health]] have certain identifiable determinants:&lt;ref name=pmid15690624&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362369042000315032 |title=Towards Collation and Modelling of the Global Cost of Armed Violence on Civilians |year=2005 |last1=Taback |first1=Nathan |last2=Coupland |first2=Robin |journal=Medicine, Conflict and Survival |volume=21 |pmid=15690624 |pages=19–27 |issue=1}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the victim's vulnerability;
*the [[Lists of weapons|type of weapon]] or weapons used;
*the potential number of weapons in use;
*the psychological aspect of how the violence is perpetrated.

While teaching a course at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] (2003), Coupland began collaborating with Taback, a statistician with an interest in [[global health]]. Their collaboration involved refining Coupland's original theory and developing the means to make quantifiable the various determinants for a given outcome of armed violence. The result has come to be known as the Taback-Coupland model of armed violence.&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Insight |first=Disarmament |url=http://disarmamentinsight.blogspot.com/2007/09/analyzing-armed-violence-taback.html |title=Disarmament Insight: Analyzing armed violence: the Taback - Coupland model |publisher=Disarmamentinsight.blogspot.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}{{MEDRS|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupland and Taback later met Wille while she was working for the [[Small Arms Survey]] (2006), and applied the model to map the nature and extent of armed violence on a geographical basis. Willie worked on refining the model further and the structure of the corresponding [[databases]] to allow application of the model to analyze different kinds of violent events. Later Taback, Willie and Coupland founded Insecurity Insight (2008).

==Activities==
The core activity of Insecurity Insight is to promote, use and make available to others the Taback-Coupland model. Because the model can be applied to any act of violence using any weapons resulting in any effect, the model has been applied to subjects such as [[explosion|explosive force]] in populated areas,&lt;ref name="slideshare1"&gt;Action on Armed Violence (2009). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/02-13093711 Explosive Violence: The Problem of Explosive Weapons].”&lt;/ref&gt; attacks on [[journalists]]&lt;ref&gt;Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/09-13093705 Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security].” Thinking Outside the Box in Multilateral Disarmament and Arms Control Negotiations by John Borrie and Vanessa Martin Randin (eds), 2006, United Nations publication, Sales No.GV.E.06.0.16; pp. 191–206.{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual violence]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.300.6.653 |title=Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo |year=2008 |last1=Taback |first1=N. |last2=Painter |first2=R. |last3=King |first3=B. |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=6 |pmid=18698063 |pages=653–4}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zimbabwe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Electing to Rape: Sexual Terror in Mugabe's Zimbabwe | publisher=[[AIDS-Free World]] | year=December 2009 | pages=52 | url=http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/Publications-Multimedia/Reports/Electing-to-Rape.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacks on [[health care workers]] and [[Health care facilities|facilities]].&lt;ref name="slideshare2"&gt;Coupland Robin, Christina Wille, Nathan Taback and Simon Regard, ICRC (2011). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/03-13093712 Sixteen Country Study: Health Care in Danger].”&lt;/ref&gt;

A major ongoing project is the building of the “Security in Numbers Database.” This is a collaborative effort initiated by Insecurity Insight involving a number of major [[International nongovernmental organization|international humanitarian NGOs]]. By taking part in this project, these organisations share their security incidents with Insecurity Insight on a confidential basis; this permits analysis of these incidents by the model and therefore comparison of any single agency’s security issues with what is known globally about aid worker security. This has already generated findings.&lt;ref&gt;Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2011). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/06-13093715 Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: Aid, Gender and Security: The Gendered Nature of Security Events Affecting Aid Workers and Aid Delivery].”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2010) ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/05-13093714 Is Terrorism an Issue for Humanitarian Agencies?]” Perspectives 3 by the Security Management Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wille Christina and Larissa Fast (2010). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/07-13093717 Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: How do security events affecting humanitarian agencies differ between rural and urban environments?]”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taback-Coupland model of armed violence==
[[File:Taback Coupland.png|thumb|right|400px|The "Taback-Coupland model of armed violence."]]

Based on a standard [[public health]] model, the Taback-Coupland model takes as a starting point that use of weapons has a health impact and that this health impact is amenable to a preventive approach as any other public health issue. By generating data about threats to and vulnerabilities of people’s lives and well-being through violence and weapons, appropriate preventive policies can be proposed.&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"/&gt;

The model is constructed around four “[[risk factors]]” or determinants for any given effects of armed violence. The four determinants are the nature of the weapon, the number of weapons used (or potentially used), the way the weapon is used (the psychological aspect of the violence), and the victims’ vulnerability. An example is the lethality of attacks with [[firearms]]. This will be determined by:

*the kind of firearms (death is more likely if a larger [[caliber|calibre]] weapon is used, because the [[wound]] will be bigger);
*how many firearms are being shot against the victim(s);
*whether the user is standing close to (e.g. 5 metres) or further away (e.g. 200 metres) from the victim(s);
*whether the victim(s) of the attack are cornered, tied up, can run away or take cover.

This example also shows the important interaction at a psychological level between how the weapon is used, the other determinants and perceptions of the potential outcome. (Whether the trigger is pulled to cause a fatal injury is influenced, for example, by whether the user of the firearm believes he or she can hit the victim(s) with it, whether there are others similarly armed, how easy it is to hit the victim(s) in that context, and whether the victim(s) have already been hit.)

===How to use the model===
The method uses written reports of real incidents of armed violence as the source for the necessary values. Information from a report on an individual incident is entered into a spreadsheet specially designed to capture and process information about the people committing violence and about the victim(s) or potential victim(s). In this way, qualitative sources of data about violence i.e., reports, can be fed into a specially prepared relational database; this uses [[binaries]] and surrogates to give a numeric value to determinants such as intent and vulnerability. (For example, for vulnerability: Were the people herded into a confined space before being shot? Yes / No) A “report” can be a very short text as indicated by the following sentence: “Two masked men entered Hospital X last night and shot dead a sleeping patient.” In terms of entry into the database, this can be read as: Two masked men [number of people armed] entered Hospital X [where] last night [when] and shot [weapon (firearms)] dead [outcome] a [outcome] sleeping patient [vulnerability]. ("Shot dead" is also a comment on intent.)

When the database has been fed with a sufficient number of reports of real events about a certain issue, this permits an “evidence-based” dialogue about the perpetrators and their intents and about the victims and their vulnerabilities. Taback and Coupland tested the model using [[global news]] reports about violence in general&lt;ref name=pmid15690624/&gt; and about attacks on journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/09-13093705 Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security].”{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went further and termed such an approach “the science of human security.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13623690601084518 |title=The science of human security |year=2007 |last1=Taback |first1=Nathan |last2=Coupland |first2=Robin |journal=Medicine, Conflict and Survival |volume=23 |pmid=17370855 |pages=3–9 |issue=1}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All important limitations of the data gathering method based on the model relate to the completeness and accuracy of the qualitative reports which are fed into the model. However, as Taback and Coupland have pointed out, reports, especially media reports may be the only information available about a given context or form of violence in multiple contexts. It is nevertheless possible to generate policy-relevant quantitative data from such sources. Further, they point out that while there are international surveillance systems for monitoring [[outbreak|infectious disease outbreaks]], no such system exists (yet) to evaluate on a regular basis the effects of armed violence on peoples’ lives. With that in mind, the method developed by Taback and Coupland is a useful contribution to international efforts to enhance [[human security]], including in [[disarmament]].&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"/&gt;

===Use of the Taback-Coupland model===
The model has generated original and policy-relevant data in relation to subjects such as explosive force in populated areas,&lt;ref name="slideshare1"/&gt; and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Aids-Free World. (2009) ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/04-13093713 Electing to Rape: Sexual Terror in Mugabe's Zimbabwe].”&lt;/ref&gt; A major study involving analysis of 655 attacks on health care workers and facilities was commissioned by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC);&lt;ref name="slideshare2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.d4671 |title=Delivering healthcare in situations of conflict or violence |year=2011 |last1=Nathanson |first1=V. |journal=BMJ |volume=343 |pages=d4671 |pmid=21831934}}&lt;/ref&gt; its publication marked the launch of the ICRC’s “Health Care in Danger” project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/icrc/d/70209252-Red-Cross-Red-Crescent-Magazine-No-2-2011 Red Cross, Red Crescent Magazine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25198">An '''intergovernmental organization''' or '''international governmental organisation''' ('''IGO''') is an [[organization]] composed primarily of [[sovereign state]]s (referred to as ''[[member state]]s''), or of other intergovernmental organizations. Intergovernmental organizations are  called [[international organization]]s, although that term may also include [[international non-governmental organization]] such as international [[nonprofit organization]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s.
 
Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of [[public international law]]. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a [[charter]] creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a [[ratification]] process, providing the IGO with an international [[legal personality]].

Intergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the [[G8]] or the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as [[task force|task group]]s.

Intergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties (such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], or the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] before the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]]) do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' commission. Other treaties{{which|date=March 2016}} have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Types and purpose==
Intergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or [[charter]]. Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through [[conflict resolution]] and better [[international relations]], promote international cooperation on matters such as [[List of supranational environmental agencies|environmental protection]], to promote [[human rights]], to promote [[Social change|social development]] (education, [[health care]]), to render [[humanitarian aid]], and to [[economic development]]. Some are more general in scope (the United Nations) while others may have subject-specific missions (such as Interpol or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and other [[standards organization]]s). Common types include:

* Worldwide or global organizations - generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met. This category includes the [[United Nations]] (UN) and its specialized agencies, the [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organisations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], a globally operating intergovernmental organisation based in [[The Hague]] that pursues the progressive unification of [[Conflict of laws|private international law]].
* Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations - open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link. Examples include the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[Turkic Council]], [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]],  [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).
* Economic organizations - based on economic organization. Some are dedicated to [[free trade]] and the reduction of trade barrier, e.g. [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. Others are focused on [[International Development Research Centre|international development]]. International [[cartel]]s, such as [[OPEC]], also exist. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) was founded as an economics-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the [[Bank of the South]].
* Educational organizations - centered around tertiary level study. [[Academy of European Law]] offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (university)]] chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.
* Health and Population Organizations- based on the common perceived health and population goals and to address those challenges collectively. An example is the intergovernmental partnership for population and development [http://www.partners-popdev.org/ Partners in Population and Development].
* [[Regional organization]]s - open to members from a particular continent region or other specific region of the world. This category includes the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CLACS), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[European Union]] (EU), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU), [[Energy Community]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[African Union]] (AU), [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), Islamic Development Bank, [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS)
[[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).

In 1993 the network was formalized under its present name, but remained a project of IDRC. Work to launch INBAR as an independent organization started in 1995, and was completed in 1997 when INBAR became an independent organization with its headquarters in Beijing, China – the first intergovernmental organization to be headquartered in the People's Republic.
Membership and structure

Membership

42 member countries make up this organisation.

==History==
While treaties, [[Political alliance|alliances]], and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] conferences had existed for centuries, IGOs only began to be established in the 19th century. Among the first were the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], initiated in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the International Telegraph Union (the future [[International Telecommunication Union]]), which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. Of notable significance was the emergence of the [[League of Nations]] following World War One, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace.

==Expansion and growth==
Held and McGrew (2002) counted thousands of IGOs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; and this number continues to rise. This increase may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the cooperation among and within states. Globalization has also provided easier means for IGO growth, as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=12|issue=4|pages=613–641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Megan. "The Expansion of International Organizations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hilton Chicago and the Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, IL, Sep 02, 2004 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-05-26 [http://www.allacademic.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125043303/http://www.allacademic.com/ |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation and involvement==
There are several different reasons a state may choose membership in an intergovernmental organization. But there are also reasons membership may be rejected. These reasons are explored in the sections below.

Reasons for participation:
# Economic rewards: In the case of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), many different countries receive economic benefits from membership in the free trade agreement. For example, Mexican companies are given better access to [[United States|U.S.]] markets due to their membership.
# Political influence: Smaller countries, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Belgium]], who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs, such as the [[European Union]]. Also for countries with more influence such as [[France]] and [[Germany]] they are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries' internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance 
# Security: Membership in an IGO such as [[NATO]] gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.
# Improve democracy and the likelihood of democratic survival: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.
 
Reasons for rejecting membership:
# Loss of [[sovereignty]]: Membership often comes with a loss of state sovereignty as treaties are signed which require cooperation on the part of all member states.
# Insufficient benefits: Often membership does not bring about substantial enough benefits to warrant membership in the organization.

==Privileges and immunities==
Intergovernmental organizations are provided with privileges and immunities that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties that give rise to the organization (such as the [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]] and the [[Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court]]), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]] in the United States). The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.

Rather than by national jurisdiction, legal [[accountability]] is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parish | first = Matthew | title = An essay on the accountability of international organizations | journal = International Organizations Law Review | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–342 | doi= 10.1163/157237410X543332 | ssrn = 1651784 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to administrative tribunals. In the course of many court cases where private parties tried to pursue claims against international organizations, there has been a gradual realization  that alternate means of dispute settlement are required, as states have [[fundamental human rights]] obligations to provide plaintiffs with access to court in view of their [[right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heitz | first = André | title = UN Special number 645 | url = http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | quote = The French court said… The right to a day in court prevails over jurisdictional immunity | date = November 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071051/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | archivedate = 2013-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinisch |first1=August |last2=Weber |first2=Ulf Andreas |title=In the shadow of Waite and Kennedy – the jurisdictional immunity of international organizations, the individual's right of access to the courts and administrative tribunals as alternative means of dispute settlement |journal=International Organizations Law Review |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–110 |doi=10.1163/1572374043242330 |date=2004 |ref=harv }} [http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171912/http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Otherwise, the organizations' immunities may be put in question in national and international courts.&lt;ref name="Shadow" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Some organizations hold proceedings before tribunals relating to their organization to be confidential, and in some instances have threatened disciplinary action should an employee disclose any of the relevant information. Such confidentiality has been criticized as a lack of [[Transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ The success of which we cannot speak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019133530/http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ |date=2013-10-19 }}, brettonwoodlaw.com, 11 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
These are some of the strengths and weaknesses of IGOs:

Strengths:
# They hold state authority.
# Their institutions are permanent.
# They provide a forum for discussion.
# They are issue specific.
# They provide information.
# They allow multilateral cooperation.

Weaknesses:
# Membership is limited. Prohibits the membership of private citizens. This makes IGOs undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal membership.
# IGOs often overlap resulting in a complex network.
# States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the state's ability to assert its authority.
# Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.

They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.

==History==

The idea to form an international federation of educational associations for workers was conceived during [[World War II]], at the annual conference of the [[United Kingdom]] Workers' Educational Association. In 1945 a conference for members of workers' educational organisations from a number of countries was held in London, where it was resolved to create an international coalition to support collaboration between organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=UIA Open Yearbook - IFWEA History|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1947 the International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations (IFWEA) was officially launched at a conference in London where a formal constitution was adopted. Worker representatives from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden attended, while observers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States of America were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/tom.davies/IFWEA.html|title=Project on the Evolution of International Non-Governmental Organisations - City University, London|last=Davies|first=Dr Thomas Richard|date=10 June 2010|website=staff.city.ac.uk.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A President and Secretary General were elected, and an Executive Committee was appointed with regional representation. Representation is now regularly modified to reflect the  federation's membership.

Over the past 71 years membership of IFWEA has increased. {{As of|2018}}, IFWEA has affiliates in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines, India, Cambodia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Peru and the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=Members - IFWEA|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFWEA helps new organisations, particularly in [[developing countries]], and provides a global space for worker educators to share resources and advance the role of trade unions and community struggles in the transformation of society. An important role is to facilitate information exchanges between members.

==Purpose==

The purpose of IFWEA is to “advance the education of the public with respect to the democratic labour movement; and to promote the carrying out of free and voluntary educational work, according to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, justice and equality, and democracy and freedom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifwea.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=IFWEA - Our Motivation: Purpose and Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=ifwea.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The highest decision making assembly in IFWEA is the quadrennial International General Conference.  The General Secretary, President and Executive Committee are elected at this conference. The 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; IFWEA General Conference was held in Lima, Peru in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smlr.rutgers.edu/news/international-federation-workers-education-association-ifwea-22nd-international-conference|title=International Federation of Workers' Education Association (IFWEA) 22nd International Conference - Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations|last=|first=|date=|website=smlr.rutgers.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the IFWEA Secretariat is to stimulate the development of a democratic workers’ education movement, by providing contact between member organisations, assisting with the development of partnerships, and promoting best practice in educational design and delivery through the provision of education resources, web communication and learning events such as workshops, seminars and conferences. The IFWEA Secretariat was registered in Cape Town, South Africa in 2009, after the election of IFWEA General Secretary Sahra Ryklief in December 2007. Previously it had been registered in the UK with the Secretariat in Manchester, and prior to that, it was hosted by the AOF Norway, with the Secretariat in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/Careers/Winning-Women-Sahra-Ryklief-Creating-the-doers-of-tomorrow-20151108|title=City Press/News24 - Sahra Ryklief interview|last=|first=|date=|work=city-press.news24.com|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival records of IFWEA 1945 to 1986 are held at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Library Collections and University Archives at London Metropolitan University, reference code GB 1924 IFWEA. Current records are held at the Institute of The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.socialhistory.org/Record/ARCH00636|title=Collection Summary: International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations Archives|website=search.socialhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8605">The '''International Sanitary Conferences''' were a series of 14 conferences, the first of them organized by the French Government in 1851 to standardize international quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever. In total 14 conferences took place from 1851 to 1938; the conferences played a major role in the formation of the [[World Health Organization]] in 1948.

==Background==
The outbreak of the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|Second cholera pandemic]] in 1829, prompted European Governments to appoint medical missions to investigate the causes of the epidemic. Among others, the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Royal Academy of Medicine of Paris]] in June 1831, sent [[Auguste Gérardin]] ([[:fr:Auguste Gérardin|fr]]) and [[Paul Gaimard]] on medical mission to [[Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the [[Minister of Commerce and Industry (France)|Minister of Commerce]] of France, appointed the Secretary of the [[Conseil supérieur de la santé]], [[P. de. Ségur-Dupeyron]] with the task of creating a report on the sanitary regulations
of the [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean countries]]. The report published in 1834, pointed to the differing quarantine requirements among the countries, and proposed to convene an international conference to standardise quarantine requirements against exotic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47233">This is a list of '''longest prison sentences served''' by a single person, worldwide, without a period of freedom followed by a second conviction. These cases rarely coincide with the [[list of longest prison sentences|longest prison sentences]] given, because some countries have laws that don't allow sentences without [[parole]] or for convicts to remain in prison beyond a given number of years (regardless of their original conviction).

The second victim identified a different man as her attacker but the judge argued that both men looked alike enough. Ford, at the time the only person present at his first conviction who was still alive, was granted retrials in 2015 for both charges because he had not been informed of his right to appeal the sentences. He was found innocent of both and released to a nursing home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaynet.com/articles/0316/manfreeatlastafter64yearsinprison.html|title=Man free at last after 64 years in prison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national '''Museum of World Culture''' ({{lang-sv|Världskulturmuseet}}) opened in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, in 2004. It is a part of the public authority [[Swedish National Museums of World Cultures]] and builds on the collections of the former [[Göteborgs Etnografiska Museum]] that closed down in the year 2000. Its aim is to interpret the subject of [[world culture]] in an interdisciplinary way. The museum is situated next to the [[Universeum]] science centre and the amusement park [[Liseberg]], and close to [[Korsvägen]].&lt;ref name=sfv&gt;{{cite web|title=Världskulturmuseet, Göteborg|url=http://www.sfv.se/sv/fastigheter/sverige/vastra-gotalands-lan-o/varldskulturmuseet-i-goteborg/|website=www.sfv.se|publisher=[[National Property Board of Sweden]]|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"''The museum interprets the concept of world culture in a dynamic and open-ended manner. On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike. On the other hand, local, national, ethnic and gender differences are shaping much of that process. World culture is not only about communication, reciprocity, and interdependence, but the specificity, concretion and uniqueness of each and every individual.''" (From the background info on the museums homepage.)

The opening exhibitions of the museum were:
* No Name Fever: [[AIDS]] in the age of [[globalization]]
* Horizons: Voices from a global [[Africa]]
* Sister of Dreams: People and [[Mythology|myths]] of the Orinoco
* Fred Wilson: Site unseen - Dwellings of the Demons
* 390 m2 [[Spirituality]]

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Göteborg Museum of World Culture grand stairs.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The grand stairs in the atrium (Fotograf: [[Hélène Binet]])]]
The cement and glass building, located on a slope leading up to the Liseberg amusement park, is graceful, compact and modernistic. Its four-storey glass atrium looks out on mountains and woods.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The exhibition halls are in the closed part of the building, facing Södra vägen road. The upper storeys hang freely {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} over a footpath. A {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} long section of a display window provides passers-by with a view straight into the largest exhibition hall.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The architects behind the museum, who were chosen after an international competition, were the French-Cuban-English couple Cécile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez of Brisac Gonzalez Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of World Culture, Gothenburg|url=http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|website=www.brisacgonzalez.com|publisher=Brisac Gonzalez|accessdate=29 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919025144/http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In February 2005 the museum decided to remove the painting "[[Scène d'Amour]]" by [[Louzla Darabi]]. The painting was part of a temporary exhibition about [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and depicted a man and a woman having sexual intercourse. The artist and the curator had received numerous death threats from Muslims saddened and frustrated over the [[Koran]] quotations which were featured in a corner of the painting. Some threats were telling the artist to "learn from the Netherlands", referring to the murder of van Gogh and threats against Hirsi Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=236913|title=Dödshot stoppar kärlekstavlan |trans-title=Death threat stops love painting|last=Lilja|first=Mats|publisher=[[Expressen]]|website=www.expressen.se|date=3 February 2005|language=Swedish|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''non-communicable disease''' ('''NCD''') is a [[disease]] that is not [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] directly from one person to another. NCDs include [[parkinson's disease]] [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[stroke]]s, most [[heart disease]]s, most [[cancer]]s, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cataract]]s, and others. NCDs may be [[chronic condition|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]]. Most are non-[[infection|infectious]], although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as [[parasitic disease]]s in which the parasite's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] does not include direct host-to-host transmission. 

NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, they caused 68% of all deaths (38 million) up from 60% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half were under age 70 and half were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/topics/noncommunicable_diseases/en/ |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of [[high blood pressure]].

== Risk factors ==
[[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, [[gender]], [[genetics]], exposure to [[air pollution]], and behaviors such as [[smoking]], [[Healthy diet|unhealthy diet]] and [[Sedentary lifestyle|physical inactivity]] which can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.

The WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2002'']] identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised [[cholesterol]], tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the "[social determinants of health]."

It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and [[type 2 diabetes]] and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .

==Environmental diseases==
NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable [[health|human health]] conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices.  The [[diseases of affluence]] are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes.  Examples include:
* Many types of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD)
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]
* [[Lower back pain]] caused by too little exercise
* [[Malnutrition]] caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. [[scurvy]] from lack of [[Vitamin C]])
* [[Skin cancer]] caused by radiation from the sun
* [[Obesity]]

=== Inherited diseases ===
{{See also|List of genetic disorders}}
[[Genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.
The origin of these genetic errors can be:
* Spontaneous errors or mutations to the [[genome]]:
:* A change in chromosome [[Chromosomal condition|numbers]], such as [[Down syndrome]].
:* A defect in a gene caused by [[mutation]], such as [[Cystic fibrosis]].
:* An increase in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|amount]] of genetic information, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] or [[Heterochromia iridum|Heterochromia]].

Cystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene. The faulty gene impairs the normal movement of sodium chloride in and out of cells, which causes the mucus-secreting organs to produce abnormally thick mucus. The gene is recessive, meaning that a person must have two copies of the faulty gene for them to develop the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. This mucus causes problems with breathing and with the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
* Inherited genetic errors from [[Kinship#Descent and the family|parents]]:
:* [[Dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] genetic diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], require the inheritance of [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|one]] erroneous gene to be expressed.
:* [[Recessive]] genetic diseases require the inheritance of erroneous genes to be expressed and this is one reason they work together.

== Global health ==

Referred to as a "lifestyle" disease, because the majority of these diseases are preventable illnesses, the most common causes for non-communicable diseases (NCD) include tobacco use (smoking), alcohol abuse, poor diets (high consumption of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids) and physical inactivity. Currently, NCD kills 36 million people a year, a number that by some estimates is expected to rise by 17–24% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm |date=19 September 2011 |website=United Nations |publisher=Department of Public Information |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "[[diseases of affluence|diseases of the rich]]". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases are on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of  63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to rise considerably in the near future if measures are not taken.

If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030. With statistics such as these, it comes as no surprise that international entities such as the World Health Organization &amp; World Bank Human Development Network have identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an increasingly important discussion item on the [[global health]] agenda.

Thus, should policy makers and communities mobilize "and make prevention and targeted treatment of such diseases a priority," sustainable measures can be implemented to stagnate (and eventually even reverse) this emerging global health threat.  Potential measures currently being discussed by the(World Health Organization)-Food and Agriculture Organization includes reducing the levels of salt in foods, limiting inappropriate marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, imposing controls on harmful alcohol use, raising taxes on tobacco, and curbing legislation to curb smoking in public places.

=== United Nations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] is the specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that acts as coordinating authority on international [[public health]] issues, including NCDs. In May 2008, the 193 Member States of the WHO approved a six-year plan to address non-communicable diseases, especially the rapidly increasing burden in low- and middle-income countries. The plan calls for raising the priority given to NCDs in [[international development]] work'.

During the 64th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2010, a resolution was passed to call for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and treatment NCDs with the participation of heads of state and government. The resolution also encouraged UN Member States to address the issue of non-communicable diseases at the 2010 Review Summit for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Non-communicable Disease Network ===
In order to better coordinate efforts around the globe, in 2009 the WHO announced the launch of the ''Global Non-communicable Disease Network'' (NCDnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New network to combat noncommunicable diseases |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/noncommunicable_diseases_20090708/en/index.html |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCDnet will consist of leading health organizations and experts from around the world in order to fight against diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Ala Alwan, assistant director-general for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health at the WHO, said: "integrating the prevention of non-communicable diseases and injuries into the national and global development agendas is not only achievable but also a priority for developing countries."&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's action against non-communicable diseases|author=Alexander Chiejina|newspaper=Business Day Weekend |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCD Alliance ===
The NCD Alliance is a global partnership founded in May 2009 by four international federations representing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]]. The NCD Alliance brings together roughly 900 national member associations to fight non-communicable disease. Long term aims of the Alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdalliance.org/aboutus |title=About Us |author=The NCD Alliance |publisher=The NCD Alliance |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504050001/http://ncdalliance.org/aboutus |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs|United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases]] (UNIATF) was established by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in 2013 in order to provide scaled up action across the UN system to support governments, in particular in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs).

=== Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network ===
The Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, or commonly referred to as YP-CDN, is a global network of roughly 5000 young professionals across 157 countries. The organization aims to mobilize these young people "to take action against social injustice driven by NCDs.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdaction.org/history|title=History |author=YP-CDN |publisher=YP-CDN |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Previously, chronic NCDs were considered a problem limited mostly to [[high income economy|high income countries]], while [[infectious diseases]] seemed to affect [[low income countries]]. The burden of disease attributed to NCDs has been estimated at 85% in industrialized nations, 70% in middle income nations, and nearly 50% in countries with the lowest national incomes.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Preventing Chronic Diseases a Vital Investment |journal=Cataloguing-in-Publication Data |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, chronic NCDs accounted for more than 60% (over 35 million) of the 57 million deaths worldwide. Given the global population distribution, almost 80% of deaths due to chronic NCDs worldwide now occur in low and middle income countries, while only 20% occur in higher income countries.

National economies are reportedly suffering significant losses because of premature deaths or inability to work resulting from heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For instance, China is expected to lose roughly $558 billion in national income between 2005 and 2015 due to early deaths. In 2005, heart disease, stroke and diabetes caused an estimated loss in [[international dollar]]s of national income of 9 billion in India and 3 billion in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"/&gt;

=== Absenteeism and presenteeism ===
{{main | Absenteeism | Presenteeism}}

The burden of chronic NCDs including [[mental health]] conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to elevated levels of [[absenteeism]], or absence from work because of illness, and [[presenteeism]], or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor [[health]]. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper C, Dewe P |title=Well-being—absenteeism, presenteeism, costs and challenges |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=522–4 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19054749 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn124|last2=Dewe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost due to presenteeism is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of presenteeism are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.

== Key diseases ==

=== Cancer ===
{{main | Cancer}}

For the vast majority of cancers, risk factors are environmental or lifestyle-related, thus cancers are mostly preventable NCD.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2|last2= Vander Hoorn |last3= Lopez |last4= Murray |last5= Ezzati |author6= Comparative Risk Assessment collaborating group (Cancers) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 30% of cancer is preventable via avoiding risk factors including: [[tobacco]], being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]], low fruit and vegetable intake, [[physical inactivity]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |title=Cancer |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infectious agents are responsible for some cancers, for instance almost all [[cervical cancer]]s are caused by [[human papillomavirus]] infection.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
{{main | Cardiovascular disease}}

The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris JN, Crawford MD |title=Coronary heart disease and physical activity of work; evidence of a national necropsy survey |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5111 |pages=1485–96 |date=December 1958 |pmid=13608027 |pmc=2027542 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5111.1485|last2=Crawford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major fast food chains, particularly McDonald's, have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade [[inflammation]] that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20024640|year=2009|last1=Karakas|first1=M|last2=Koenig|first2=W|title=CRP in cardiovascular disease|volume=34|issue=8|pages=607–13|doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7|journal=Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20448212|year=2010|last1=Lieb|first1=W|last2=Gona|first2=P|last3=Larson|first3=MG|last4=Massaro|first4=JM|last5=Lipinska|first5=I|last6=Keaney Jr|first6=JF|last7=Rong|first7=J|last8=Corey|first8=D|last9=Hoffmann|first9=U|last10=Fox|first10=C.

=== Diabetes ===
{{main | Diabetes}}

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition which is largely preventable and manageable but difficult to cure.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible without presenting undue [[patient]] danger.  This can usually be with close dietary management, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin only in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Oral medications may be used in the case of type 2 diabetes, as well as insulin).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.&lt;!--

Wider health problems may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not currently identified as one of WHO's main targets for global NCD control, there is compelling evidence that CKD is not only common, harmful and treatable but also a major contributing factor to the incidence and outcomes of at least three of the diseases targeted by WHO (diabetes, hypertension and CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=Q.L. |last2=Rothenbacher |first2=D. |title=Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in population-based studies: systematic review|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-117 |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=117 |year=2008 |pmid=18405348 |pmc=2377260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CKD strongly predisposes to hypertension and CVD; diabetes, hypertension and CVD are all major causes of CKD; and major risk factors for diabetes, hypertension and CVD (such as obesity and smoking) also cause or exacerbate CKD. In addition, among people with diabetes, hypertension, or CVD, the subset who also have CKD are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. Thus, CKD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are closely associated conditions that often coexist; share common risk factors and treatments; and would benefit from a coordinated global approach to prevention and control.

=== Chronic respiratory disease ===
''Main Article: [[Respiratory disease#Chronic respiratory disease|Chronic respiratory disease]]''

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the lungs and airways.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of millions of people suffer daily from CRDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/about_topic/en/|title=WHO {{!}} About chronic respiratory diseases|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common CRDs are: [[Asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Occupational lung disease]], and [[Pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/en/|title=Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While CRDs are not curable, various treatments are available to help improve quality of life for individuals who have them.  Most treatments involve dilating major airways to improve shortness of breath among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The main risk factors for developing CRDs are: tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and occupational risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO helped launch the [[Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases]] (GARD) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GARD is voluntarily composed of national and international organizations and works toward "reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases" and focus mainly on vulnerable populations and low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Health Sciences Center for Global Health (HSCGH)''' at The [[Ohio State University]] (OSU) is a collaborative program among the OSU Colleges of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Optometry, Pharmacy, Public Health, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences and Veterinary Medicine.  The HSCGH is led jointly by the Colleges of Medicine (COM) and Public Health (CPH).

The HSCGH was created to increase student interest in global careers, prepare students for those careers and to promote, develop and coordinate [[interdisciplinary]] [[global health]] education and research throughout the [[health sciences]] colleges and the larger community.  The Board of Trustees approved the creation of the HSCGH in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trustees.osu.edu/Minutes/documents/071307.pdf The Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio), Minutes of the Meetings of the Board of Trustees, Meetings of 12, 13 July 2007](Retrieved on July 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world’s longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

=== PyeongChang 2018 ===

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza. The phases are defined by the spread of the disease; [[virulence]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] are not mentioned in the current WHO definition, although these factors have previously been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,637119,00.html |title=A whole industry is waiting for an epidemic |work=Der Spiegel |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD.

* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.

* The [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]], also known as Russian Flu, was first reported in May 1889 in [[Bukhara]], Uzbekistan. By October, it had reached [[Tomsk]] and the [[Caucasus]]. It rapidly spread west and hit [[North America]] in December 1889, South America in February–April 1890, India in February–March 1890, and Australia in March–April 1890. The [[H3N8]] and [[H2N2]] subtypes of the Influenza A virus have each been identified as possible causes.

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME.'' April 29, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812.

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Microbes: Disease and Plagues in History and Modern Times''; by [[Arno Karlen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disease had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART "Measles and Small Pox as an Allied Army of the Conquistadors of America"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502200745/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART |date=2009-05-02 }} by Carlos Ruvalcaba, translated by Theresa M.

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===

''World Health Organization.''&lt;/ref&gt; China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/01/bill-gates-tb-timebomb-china Bill Gates joins Chinese government in tackling TB 'timebomb']. ''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=== SARS ===
In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12194776 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article |pmc=2732530 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A. [http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033815/http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html |date=2015-04-03 }}; The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  A devastating smallpox epidemic plagued Native American tribes in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes area through 1763 and 1764, but the effectiveness of individual instances of biological warfare remains unknown. After extensive review of surviving documentary evidence, historian [[Francis Jennings]] concluded the attempt at biological warfare was "unquestionably effective at Fort Pitt";&lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Fortune''; Francis Jennings; W.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979. The [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] is sometimes called "biological [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]".&lt;ref name="Alibek"&gt;[[Ken Alibek]] and S. Handelman.

'''''Pathogens and Global Health''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] published by [[Maney Publishing]]. It covers [[tropical disease]]s, including their [[microbiology]], [[epidemiology]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[medical entomology]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Andrea Crisanti (scientist)|Andrea Crisanti]] ([[Imperial College London]]).

==History==
The journal was established by Sir [[Ronald Ross]] in 1906 as ''Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology'' to share the results of the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]]'s research and field expeditions. In May 2011, the journal was purchased by Maney Publishing, obtaining its current title in 2012, reflecting a broader focus including the [[biology]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], treatment, and control of [[pathogens]] of medical relevance beyond a regional definition.

[[Population health]], a field which focuses on the improvement of the health outcomes for a group of individuals, has been described as consisting of three components: "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David|last2=Stoddart|first2=Greg|date=2016-10-15|title=What Is Population Health?|pmc=1447747|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=3|pages=380–383|issn=0090-0036|pmid=12604476|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies and Interventions define the methods in which [[Health outcomes research|health outcomes]] and patterns of [[health determinant]]s are implemented. Policies which are helpful "improve the conditions under which people live".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Interventions encourage healthy behaviors for individuals or populations through "program elements or strategies designed to produce behavior changes or improve health status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.mo.gov/data/interventionmica/index_4.html|title=What is an intervention?|website=health.mo.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies and interventions are needed due to the inequalities amongst populations and the inconsistent way care is administered. Policies can include "necessary community and personal social and health services" &lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; as well as taxes on alcohol and soft drinks and implement smoking cessation policies. Interventions can include therapeutic or preventative health care and may also include actions taken by the individual or by someone on behalf of the individual. The application of population health is determined by the policies and interventions which can be implemented within an organization, city, state or country.

== Common methodology ==
Countries, states, provinces and providers across the globe are shifting towards better systems to respond to inconsistent health outcomes, mitigate decreasing margins and replace outdated methods such as [[fee-for-service]] health delivery. Payment model reforms, including the [[Accountable Care Organization]] (ACO), provide roadmaps for healthcare reform and drive many of its constituents towards more effective and innovative means for improving health outcomes. Population health management is a common approach for resolving these challenges but it involves new methods, tools, systems and implementations to correct inefficiencies and improve health outcomes.

Population health tools and computer systems include data exchange, large datasets, and advanced software which are used to supply data scientists and research teams with appropriate information which can then be used by policy makers and change agents. This method helps to set policies around population health as well as intervention strategies which are then used to respond to the needs of a population.

== Policies and Policymakers ==
Policy for population health "sets priorities" &lt;ref name=Milio&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milio|first=N|date=2016-10-10|title=Glossary: healthy public policy*|pmc=1731988|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=55|issue=9|pages=622–623|doi=10.1136/jech.55.9.622|issn=0143-005X|pmid=11511639}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are a "guide to action to change what would otherwise occur".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Policies are based on "social sciences of sociology, economics, demography, public health, anthropology, and epidemiology" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David A|date=2016-10-13|title=Understanding Population Health Terminology|pmc=2690307|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=85|issue=1|pages=139–161|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00479.x|issn=0887-378X|pmid=17319809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and determine how outcomes can be accomplished are implemented at various levels. Such guides determine laws, policies, and ordinances and are defined by policymakers. Examples of policies include "smoking bans, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, seat belt laws, water fluoridation, and restaurant menu labeling".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.improvingpopulationhealth.org/blog/policies-and-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; They may be applied to a commercial establishment such as a restaurant, business workplace or within a city or state level. Policies should be evidence based and require academic studies or research to support the approach. This will assure that the appropriate measures needed for each demographic are promoted to encourage the necessary intervention practices which can be applied to each population or to the nation as a whole.

Policymakers can be classified as both private and public and are defined as someone who is in a position of authority to implement health policies. A public policy maker could be a government official and a private policymaker could be a business owner or administrator. Policymakers are influenced by, and can also be, change agents. Change agents include "legislators in Washington, an attorney general, regulators at the FDA, an advocacy group or other organizations that clearly have influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

== Political strategy ==
The goal for any political strategies surrounding population health is to "improve chances of success for policy adoption and implementation".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Such strategies include the creation of funds to support initiatives and the construction of strategies which limit conflicts of interest in the implementation of public policy.

=== Tobacco Control ===
A political strategy implemented to limit the sale and exposure to tobacco products and restrict the tobacco company's ability to benefit politically from charitable donations is the creation of the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|World Health Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)]] treaty. The legally binding document is supported by numerous countries, government/nongovernment agencies and provides the necessary power to prevent negative influences on population health policies.

== Interventions ==
Interventions in population health "shift the distribution of health risk by addressing the underlying social, economic and environmental conditions"&lt;ref name=Hawe&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawe|first=Penelope|last2=Potvin|first2=Louise|date=2017-02-01|title=What is population health intervention research?|pmid=19263977|journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health = Revue Canadienne De Santé Publique|volume=100|issue=1|pages=Suppl I8–14|issn=0008-4263}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are implemented through "programs or policies designed and developed in the health sector, but they are more likely to be in sectors elsewhere, such as education, housing or employment".&lt;ref name=Hawe/&gt; They are aimed at reducing such things as [[childhood obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], smoking and mental health issues throughout society. The means in which interventions are devised is through extensive research and contributions from medical scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. They are implemented by but are not limited to educators, practicing physicians, business administrators and mental health professionals.

== Approaches and Implementations ==

A typical approach includes assessing the conditions and possible improvements which can be made within the social determinants that have been identified. Each approach is handled at a state or health plan level.

One example was a workplace in China which implemented policies and interventions for their staff to fight depression. By recognizing the importance of mental health, they were able to reduce depression and improve job satisfaction across the company. The company published its research and findings to promote "enterprises taking more responsibility for the provision of mental health services to their employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jing|last2=Buys|first2=Nicholas|last3=Wang|first3=Xinchao|date=2013-05-14|title=Effectiveness of a Workplace-Based Intervention Program to Promote Mental Health among Employees in Privately Owned Enterprises in China|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/pop.2012.0113|journal=Population Health Management|volume=16|issue=6|pages=406–414|doi=10.1089/pop.2012.0113|issn=1942-7891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was the implementation of a smoking cessation program to the province of Ontario. Studies were performed on weekly visit rates to psychiatric emergency departments before and after the implementation. The result was a "15.5% reduction in patient visits for patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurdyak|first=Paul|last2=Cairney|first2=John|last3=Sarnocinska-Hart|first3=Anna|last4=Callahan|first4=Russell C.|last5=Strike|first5=Carol|date=2008-11-01|title=The impact of a smoking cessation policy on visits to a psychiatric emergency department|pmid=19087472|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie|volume=53|issue=11|pages=779–782|issn=0706-7437|doi=10.1177/070674370805301110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequalities and Variance of Implementation ==

As is the common understanding of population health, health inequalities, defined as a "generic term used to designate differences, variations, and disparities in the health achievements of individuals and groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pmc = 1732240 | title =A Glossary for Health Inequalities | authors= Kawachi, I, S Subramanian, and N Almeida-Filho | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 56 | pages = 647–652
 | year = 2002 | pmid=12177079 | doi=10.1136/jech.56.9.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered to correctly implement the most effective policies and interventions. Based on a population and its socioeconomic, geographic, ethnicity and other factors, policies and interventions may vary. Policies implemented for one population may be less effective and more costly than it would be for another similar population. For example, US policies tend to be more costly than European and have less impact. Research has shown that in some instances, "Americans had worse outcomes than their international peers"&lt;ref name=Squires&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Squires|first=David|last2=Anderson|first2=Chloe|title=U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also had "the lowest life expectancy at birth of the countries studied".&lt;ref name=Squires/&gt;

An industry involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources, such as copper and timber, as well as by activities such as farming and fishing. A company in a primary industry can also be involved in turning natural resources into products.
Primary industry tends to make up a larger portion of the economy of developing countries than they do for developed countries. See also service industry, secondary industry.
The '''primary sector''' is concerned with the extraction of raw materials. It includes fishing, farming and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary sector of the economy|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/concepts/primary-sector/|website=Economics Help|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary industry is a larger sector in [[developing country|developing countries]]; for instance, [[animal husbandry]] is more common in countries in [[Africa]] than in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2554153|title=Review of The Primary Sector in Economic Development|first=C. D.|last=Scott|date=2 July 1986|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=53|issue=211|pages=414–416|doi=10.2307/2554153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining in 19th-century [[South Wales]] provides a case study of how an economy can come to rely on one form of activity.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm Mining: it's only a word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123191936/http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm |date=2007-01-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developed country|developed countries]] the primary industry has become more technologically advanced, for instance the mechanization of farming as opposed to hand picking and planting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more developed countries, additional capital is invested in primary means of production.  As an example, in the United States' [[corn belt]], [[combine harvester]]s pick the corn, and sprayers spray large amounts of [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[fungicide]]s, producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques.  These technological advances and investment allow the primary sector to require less workforce and, this way, developed countries tend to have a smaller percentage of their workforce involved in primary activities, instead having a higher percentage involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors.&lt;ref&gt;H Dwight H. Perkins: Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, Vol. 31, No. 1, China's Developmental Experience (Mar., 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed countries are allowed to maintain and develop their primary industries even further due to the excess wealth. For instance, European Union [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] provide buffers for the fluctuating inflation rates and prices of agricultural [[produce]]. This allows developed countries to be able to export their agricultural products at extraordinarily low prices.  This makes them extremely competitive against those of poor or underdeveloped countries that maintain free market policies and low or non-existent tariffs to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm WTO MINISTERIAL OUTCOME IMBALANCED AGAINST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823085546/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm Third World Farmers Hit by Unfair Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909232153/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/international/farmers10-08-2002.htm|title=U.S. subsidies help big business, but crush farmers from developing  countries|author=|date=|website=www.finalcall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such differences also come about due to more efficient production in developed economies, given farm machinery, better information available to farmers, and often larger scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">A '''reception report''' is a means by which radio stations (usually [[shortwave|short-]] and [[Medium frequency|medium-wave]] broadcasters) receive detailed feedback from their listeners about the quality and content of their broadcasts. A reception report consists of several pieces of information which help the station verify that the report confirms coverage of their transmission, and usually include the following information:

*Date, time and frequency (in [[Hertz|kHz]]) of the transmission
*Station name
*Description of the [[interval signal]], if heard
*Programme details
*Name of announcers or programme host, if heard
*Details of the overall signal quality (normally using the [[SINPO]] code)

The listener's location relative to the station is also useful; this indicates how well the station's [[transmitter]] is performing and in which direction(s) its antenna is beaming the signal. The station also evaluates a reception report in light of the listener's [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] and antenna. Upon receipt of a correct report, a broadcaster sometimes issues a letter or [[postcard]] (known as a [[QSL card]]) to the sender, thanking them and confirming that the details are correct.  "QSL" is part of the [[amateur radio]] [[Q code]], meaning "I acknowledge receipt". One aspect of [[DXing]] is collecting QSL cards and letters from stations heard (similar to a [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher's]] "life list"). QSLing a radio station involves writing an accurate reception report, mailing it to the station and awaiting a reply. Since QSLing is a voluntary act on the station's part, several techniques are used to improve a listener's success rate.

==Useful reception reports==
Station engineers and other personnel are primarily interested in whether or not their station is heard, and how well; therefore, a complete and accurate reception report (whether by postal or e-mail) is generally appreciated. To begin, report the frequency, date and time the station was heard. For medium-wave (AM) stations, the time should be that of the [[time zone]] in which the station is located. Thus, if a listener hears stations from the [[Eastern time zone]] of North America (such as Ontario and New York), [[Standard time|EST]] or [[Daylight saving time|EDT]] should be given (depending on the time of year). Stations in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central time zone]] (such as [[Chicago]]) use CST or CDT, which is one hour earlier than Eastern time. If a listener is uncertain of the time zone, they should clearly indicate their local time or even better use [[UTC]]

It is helpful to jot down programming as it is heard. Useful details include:

*[[Station identification]]
*Program name
*Names of station announcers (such as a [[talk show]] host)
*Commercials (good indicators, because the station keeps a [[logbook]] of commercials
*Names of [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|network programs]], such as "[[CNN]] News" or "[[The Sports Network|TSN Sports]]"

The purpose of providing this information is to prove to the station that you heard their program and not that of another station. The more detail a listener can provide, the better the chance of eliciting a QSL. Include information, also, about how well the signal was received. For medium-wave reports, an indication of signal strength and any interference ([[Co-channel interference|co-]] or [[adjacent-channel interference]], with identity of interfering station if possible) is usually sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html Quick Guide to Reception Reports]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531172957/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International shortwave broadcasters are familiar with the [[SINPO]] code:

*'''S'''ignal strength
*'''I'''nterference (includes human-generated noise—for example, power-line hum)
*'''N'''oise ("white [[Noise (radio)|noise"]], or thunderstorm static)
*'''P'''ropagation disturbance ([[fading]])
*'''O'''verall reception quality

Each letter receives a value between 5 and 1, where 5 is the best and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof of what they have heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Writing Useful Reception Reports http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154511/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for [[international reply coupon]]s (IRCs), [[mint stamp]]s from the verifying station's country or "green stamps" (US dollar bills).

'''Recorded history''' or '''written history''' is a [[history|historical narrative]] based on a written record or other documented communication. It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded history begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.

The interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.

== Prehistory ==
{{Further|History of writing}}

[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell1922"&gt;Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.

[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.

More complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vinča signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became "true writing"&lt;ref&gt;Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].

===East Asia===
In China, the earliest history was recorded in [[oracle bone script]] which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = "综述", 中国考古学报第5册(Acta Archaeologica Sinica)|publisher=《考古学报》编辑部|year = 1951 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|B.C. }}, is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }}. The ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551–479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.

[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|B.C. }}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.

===Europe===
[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 B.C. – c. 425 B.C. )&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |date=1979 |page=5|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history" composing his [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5" /&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |date=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C. ]]According to [[John Tosh]], "From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history."&lt;ref name="Tosh59"&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].

===South Asia===
In Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]]. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) "Island Chronicles" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.

A companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' "Lesser Chronicle", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.

The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tripāṭhī|editor1-first=Śrīdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nāga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.

===Middle East===
In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of recording history==
While recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|deadurl=no|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.&lt;ref name=Tosh-58-59&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical method===
The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name="primary source guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=User Education Services|title=Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=12 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, "direct, un-mediated information about the object of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historians use other types of sources to understand history as well. [[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. [[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.&lt;ref name="primary source guide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | title=Glossary, Using Information Resources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | archivedate=28 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }} ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | title=Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | archivedate=12 February 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Head of state|Heads of state]] throughout the world and at all periods of history may be ranked according to characteristics such as length of time holding that position; age of accession or death; or physical attributes. In this way   [[world record]]s in these characteristics may be identified, although the historical basis for such claims is frequently uncertain.

==Shortest serving==

The shortest serving monarch of all time is believed to be [[Louis XIX of France]]. After his father's abdication during the July Revolution on August 2, 1830, he ascended to the throne, but abdicated around 19 minutes later. This reign is disputed, as some historians believe this reign is too short to be valid. The next contender is the unnamed [[daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei]] who was appointed by her grandmother, [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]]. She reigned for a matter of hours until being replaced by Yuan Zhou.

Mexican politician [[Pedro Lascuráin|Pedro Lascuráin]] served as the 34th President of Mexico for a short period of time ranging from 15 to 56 minutes before he quit in a coup d'état in order to make General [[Victoriano Huerta]] the next President.

==Ruling houses==

===Oldest===
Officially, the current [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Akihito]] is the 125th in line from the first emperor [[Emperor Jimmu|Jimmu]], who is variously believed to have reigned in the 1st or 7th century BC. However, the earliest documentary evidence is only for the 29th emperor, [[Emperor Kinmei|Kinmei]] (AD 509–571).

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom is well-documented as being descended from [[Arnulf of Metz]] (c. AD 582–640), forefather of [[Charlemagne]], thus representing a lineage of 47 generations. (See [[Descent of Elizabeth II from the Franks]].)

The [[Ottoman Empire]] lasted for [[Ottoman family tree|36 sultans in 21 generations]], from [[Osman I]] to [[Mehmed VI]] for 623 years. (See [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire]].)

==Post-nominal numbers==
The highest post-nominal number representing a member of a royal house is 75, used by Count Heinrich LXXV [[House of Reuss|Reuss]] (r. 1800&amp;ndash;1801). All male members of the branch were named Heinrich, and were successively numbered from 1 upwards, from the beginning of each century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Russell|editor1-first= Alan|editor2-last=McWhirter|editor2-first= Norris D.|date= 1 October 1987|title= The Guinness Book of Records 1988|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TqcxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=largest+regnal+number&amp;dq=largest+regnal+number&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAmoVChMIktSgxuzUyAIVg1wUCh15fQmm|location= Fleet St., London|publisher= Guinness Superlatives ltd|page= 190|isbn= 0851128688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical attributes==

===Heaviest===
The heaviest monarch is believed to have been [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]], King of [[Tonga]] from 1965 to 2006 who at his peak in 1976 was measured as {{convert|208.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, though he subsequently lost around 40% of his weight.&lt;ref name="GBOR96"&gt;{{cite book | last = McWhirter | first = Norris  | title = [[Guinness Book of Records]]  | publisher = Guinness Publishing | year = 1996  | pages = 181–2  | isbn = 0-85112-646-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallest===
[[Sancho VII of Navarre]] was the tallest head of state. He was the King of [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. His remains were measured to indicate a height of at least {{convert|7|ft|3|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

===Shortest===
[[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Juárez]] of [[Mexico]] was reportedly the shortest world leader, standing at {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.

==Age==

===Youngest===
According to legends, the youngest ruler is [[Shapur II]] who was crowned ''in utero'' when a crown was placed on the belly of [[Hormizd II]] 's wife after Hormizd II died. However, according to [[Shapur Shahbazi]], it is unlikely. Other claims as the youngest ruler include [[John I of France]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] who were both crowned on the day of their birth.

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Modern Egypt'' (4th ed., 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Schøyen Collection''' is the largest private [[manuscript]] collection in the world, mostly located in [[Oslo]] and London. Formed in the 20th century by [[Martin Schøyen]], it comprises manuscripts of global [[provenance]], spanning 5,000 years of history. It contains more than 13,000 manuscript items; the oldest is about 5,300 years old. There are manuscripts from 134 different countries and territories, representing 120 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/aboutus.html ''The Schøyen Collection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of manuscripts—geographic, linguistic, textual and material—even more than its size makes the Schøyen Collection unique. The collection has a website with many items illustrated and described. The provenance of the various cuneiform materials held by the Schøyen Collection remains subject to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html|title=Review of: The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts, 2 vols|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=BMCR|via=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
An [[artificial general intelligence]] having undergone an [[intelligence explosion]] could form a singleton, as could a [[world government]] armed with mind control and social [[Mass surveillance|surveillance]] technologies. A singleton need not directly micromanage everything in its domain; it could allow diverse forms of organization within itself, albeit guaranteed to function within strict parameters. A singleton need not support a civilization, and in fact could obliterate it upon coming to power.

A singleton doesn't necessarily need to be an organisation, government or AI. It could form through all people accepting the same values or goals. These people coming together would form an "agency" in the broad sense of the term according to Bostrom. &lt;ref name=W&gt;Nick Bostrom (2006). [http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html "What is a Singleton?"]. ''Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations'' '''5'''(2): 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A singleton has both potential risks and potential benefits. Notably, a suitable singleton could solve world coordination problems that would not otherwise be solvable, opening up otherwise unavailable developmental trajectories for civilization. For example, [[Ben Goertzel]], an AGI researcher, suggests humans may instead decide to create an "[[AI Nanny]]" with "mildly superhuman intelligence and surveillance powers", to protect the human race from [[existential risks]] like [[nanotechnology]] and to delay the development of other (unfriendly) artificial intelligences until and unless the safety issues are solved.&lt;ref&gt;Goertzel, Ben. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140408142320/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Goertzel-Should-Humanity-Build-a-Global-AI-Nanny-to-Delay-the-Singularity-Until-its-Better-Understood.pdf Should Humanity Build a Global AI Nanny to Delay the Singularity Until It’s Better Understood?]", Journal of consciousness studies 19.1-2 (2012): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Bostrom suggests that a singleton could hold [[Darwinian evolution]]ary pressures in check, preventing agents interested only in reproduction from coming to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom (2004). [http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html "The Future of Human Evolution"]. ''Death and Anti-Death: Two Hundred Years After Kant, Fifty Years After Turing'', ed. Charles Tandy (Ria University Press: Palo Alto, California): 339-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Bostrom also regards the possibility of a stable, repressive, totalitarian global regime as a serious existential risk.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom (2002). [http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html "Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards"]. ''Journal of Evolution and Technology'' '''9'''(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The very stability of a singleton makes the installation of a ''bad'' singleton especially catastrophic, since the consequences can never be undone. [[Bryan Caplan]] writes that "perhaps an eternity of totalitarianism would be worse than extinction".&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Caplan (2008). "[https://books.google.de/books?id=sTkfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA504#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The totalitarian threat]". ''Global Catastrophic Risks'', eds. Bostrom &amp; Cirkovic (Oxford University Press): 504-519. {{ISBN|9780198570509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly [[Hans Morgenthau]] stressed that the mechanical development of weapons, transportation, and communication makes "the conquest of the world technically possible, and they make it technically possible to keep the world in that conquered state". Its lack was the reason why great ancient empires, though vast, failed to complete universal conquest of their world and perpetuate the conquest. Now, however, this is possible. Technology undoes both geographic and climatic barriers. "Today no technological obstacle stands in the way of a world-wide empire", as "modern technology makes it possible to extend the control of mind and action to every corner of the globe regardless of geography and season."&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations|Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace]], 4th edition, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, p 358-365.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau continued on the technological progress:
{{quote|It has also given total war that terrifying, world-embracing impetus which seems to be satisfied with nothing less than world dominion… The machine age begets its own triumphs, each forward step calling forth two or more on the road of technological progress. It also begets its own victories, military and political; for with the ability to conquer the world and keep it conquered, it creates the will to conquer it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations]], p 369-370.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Targeting''', a commonly used technique in [[international health]] and [[public health]], develops a specialized health intervention approach for a specific group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Wray, R. J. (2003). Tailored and targeted health communication: Strategies for enhancing information relevance. American Journal of Health Behavior, 27 (suppl 3), S227-S232.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of people may be identified by various factors, including geography, race/ethnicity, age, health issues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account characteristics the group members share in common, only one version of program materials is used in a targeted health intervention and the intervention materials show features that the targeted population subgroup members prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W., Lukwago, S. N., Bucholtz, D. C., Clark, E. M., &amp; Sanders-Thompson, V. (2002). Achieving cultural appropriateness in health promotion programs: Targeted and tailored approaches. Health Education and Behavior, 30(2), 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of targeting was adapted from [[marketing]]. Target marketing tries to define a subgroup of people with shared characteristics (such as liking of certain product features) as the right group of consumers for a particular product or service. Adopting the same principle, targeted health interventions identify a group of people who are particular vulnerable to certain health risks, intervene to address their health risks and in turn, improve their health. 
From early to mid-1980s, most health information was mass-produced for undifferentiated audience in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and booklets.&lt;ref&gt;. Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; As people are increasingly aware of different characteristics within mass audiences, behavioral scientists began to develop different versions of materials for diverse population subgroups in order for health campaigns to be cost effective while still reaching large number of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., &amp; Glassman, B. (1998). Tailoring communications for primary care settings.Methods of Information in Medicine, 37(2), 171–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M., &amp; Flora, J. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that compared to generic interventions which do not take into consideration the audience characteristics, targeting strategy can be more effective for health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience factors==
Targeting as an intervention strategy is now widely used in the health fields and has been found to help promote behavioral change.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of audience specificity in targeting can vary significantly, ranging from one single broad factor (e.g. interventions targeting women), to combined factors. For example, Gomez, Tan, Keegan, and Clarke (2007) identified South Asians in the U.S. who were less than age 50 and were unemployed or non-citizens as potential population subgroup for targeted mammogram utilization intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, S. L., Tan, S., Keegan, T. HM., &amp; Clarke, C. A. (2007). Disparities in mammographic screening for Asian women in California: A cross-sectional analysis to identify meaningful groups for targeted intervention. BMC Cancer, 7, 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted health interventions have adopted different audience factors, including age (e.g. older smokers&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. D., Noll, E. l., Orleans, C. T., Rimer, B. K., Amfoh, K. &amp; Bonney, G. (1996). Reaching mid-life and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care. Preventive medicine, 25, 346-354.&lt;/ref&gt;), race/ethnicity (e.g. African-Americans&lt;ref&gt;James, S.A., Jamjoum, L., Raghunathan, T.E., Strogatz, D.S., Furth, E.D., &amp; Khazanie, P.G. (1998). Physical activity and NIDDM in African-Americans. The Pitt County Study. Diabetes Care, 21(4), 555–562.&lt;/ref&gt;), socioeconomic status (e.g. low-income women&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, T. R., Rothman, A. J., Salovey, P., Apanovitch, A. M., Pizarro, J., McCarthy, D., &amp;Zullo, J. (2001). The effects of message framing and ethnic targeting on mammography use among low-income women. Health Psychology, 20(4), 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;), professions (e.g. health providers&lt;ref&gt;Mandelblatt, J. S. &amp; Yabroff, K. R. (1999). Effectiveness of interventions designed to increase mammography use: A meta-analysis of provider-targeted strategies. Cancer epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, 8, 759-767.&lt;/ref&gt;), health status (e.g. pregnant women and women with children,&lt;ref&gt;Keintz, M. K., Fleisher, L., &amp; Rimer, B. K. (1994). Reaching mothers of preschool-agedchildren with a targeted quit smoking intervention. Journal of Community Health, 19(1),25–40.&lt;/ref&gt; sensation-seeking adolescents&lt;ref&gt;Palmgreen, P., Donohew, L., Lorch, E. P., Hoyle, R. H., Stephenson, M. T. (2001). Television campaigns and adolescent marijuana use: Tests of sensation seeking targeting. American Journal of Public Health, 91(2), 292-296.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==In international health==
Targeting has been widely used in international health interventions and was found to be effective in promoting behavioral change.

Ahmed, Petzold, Kabir, and Tomson (2006) identified the problem in Bangladesh that there was not enough usage of formal health services among the ultra poor population.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. M., Petzold, M., Kabir, Z. N., &amp; Tomson, G. (2006). Targeted intervention for the ultra poor in rural Bangladesh: Does it make any difference in their health-seeking behaviour? Social Science &amp; Medicine, 63(11), 2899-2911.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to promote greater use of these health services, Ahmed and colleagues carried out a health intervention in Bangladesh targeting ultra poor households in rural areas in order to change their health-seeking behavior. The intervention provided ultra poor households with money for household activities (e.g. raising livestock, vegetables farming) to increase their income. In addition, it provided 18 months of supports, such as skill training (e.g. vegetable cultivation) and counseling information on health services, to make sure that the targeted people were able to make full use of the money and had the resources to use the health services if they chose to. This targeted intervention was found to be effective that it decreased the amount of self-care and increased the use of professional health care among the targeted population.

In another intervention, Lowndes, Alary, Labbe, et al. (2007) targeted male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa, in order to reduce the male clients' [[risky sexual behavior]] and HIV/STI rates.&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; During this peer-education intervention, trained health educators approached male clients at prostitution venues at night, discussed with them HIV and STI transmission risks, educated them about proper condom use, and distributed condoms. Although HIV prevalence remained unchanged, the intervention effectively affected knowledge and there was an increase in the condom use rate among the targeted population.

==Ethical considerations==
Despite its effectiveness in promoting behavioral change, targeting strategy should be used with caution and with careful considerations of ethics. Kass (2001) suggested that interventions targeting already vulnerable segments of the population may face certain ethical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Kass, N. E. (2001). An ethics framework for public health. American Journal of Public Health, 91(11), 1776-1782.&lt;/ref&gt; Potential burden and harm in these health programs may include risks to privacy and confidentiality, risks to liberty and self-determination, and risks to justice. Subgroups who are targeted in interventions take most of the burden from the process (for example, their privacy may be intruded) while the benefits resulted from the health interventions are for the general public (e.g. improvements in mortality). Kass posed the question whether the unequal distribution of burden and benefits is ethical.
Moreover, the evidence of intervention effectiveness may not be strong enough at times. Thus it may not be known for sure whether the benefits the targeted audience may gain from the intervention will outweigh the harms they will be put in. Hence, health experts face another ethical dilemma.

Kass further pointed out that targeting may create stigma that some segments of the population are more vulnerable to certain diseases, which might result in social harms, such as psychological distress and discrimination. For example, although the HIV interventions targeting male clients of female sex workers in Benin&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to HIV prevention, one possible stigma that it may create is that male clients of female sex workers are high risk population of HIV infection. This stigma may create anxiety and panic among the targeted population. On the other hand, if a subgroup were never targeted in interventions, they may not believe that they are at the risk of diseases. People who were not targeted in HIV interventions, e.g. people with regular sex partners, may perceive themselves as not at the risk of HIV infection and hence continue engaging in risky sexual behaviors.

Given the above discussed ethical dilemma that targeted health interventions may face, Kass suggested that, if health programs and health resources are going to be unequally allocated (e.g. targeting ethnic minority groups), they should be done with caution and be based on strong intervention effectiveness evidences.

==Targeting or tailoring? Competing definitions==
While Kreuter and Skinner's (2000) definition of targeting "the development of a single intervention approach for a defined population subgroup that takes into account characteristics shared by the subgroups' members" is now widely accepted in international health, targeting was defined in a few different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand the concept of tailoring in order to capture the idea of targeting, as interventions using targeting strategy were mislabeled as tailoring in some health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-	related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Pasick (1997)defined tailoring as "the adaptation of interventions to best fit the relevant needs and characteristics of a specified target population".&lt;ref&gt;Pasick, R. J. (1997). Socioeconomic and culture factors in the development and use of theory. In K. Glanz, F. M. Lewis, &amp; B. K. Rimer (Eds.), Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research and Practice (pp.425-440). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Eakin and colleagues described tailoring as "a process of producing a video whose content and characters are adapted for or designed to appeal to a particular target population". Both statements would now be considered as a more appropriate definition of "targeting" according to Kreuter and Skinner (2000). The distinction between targeting and tailoring is that targeting is to design information for a defined population subgroup while tailoring is to develop interventions for one specific person based on the individual characteristics.

Another competing definition of targeting was developed by Rimal and Adkin (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R. N. &amp; Adkin, A. D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In A. M. Dorsey, K. I. Miller, R. Parrott, &amp; T. L. Thompson (Eds.), Handbook of Health Communication (pp. 497-513). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that both targeting and tailoring should follow the [[audience segmentation]] process, which is to divide audience into highly homogeneous clusters. They distinguish targeting and tailoring by suggesting that targeting is the selection of communication channel for the health campaign while tailoring is about message design.

Despite the wide acceptance of the Kreuter and Skinner (2000) definition, Rimer (2000 pointed out that, although some "tailored" intervention would now be appropriately labeled as "targeted" intervention, these published projects are out there and the article titles remain as "tailored", which might create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. (2000). Response to Kreuter and Skinner. Health Education Research, 15(4), 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimer suggested that precision of language is important in order to avoid confusion. For people who are trying to understand targeting and tailoring, it is important to keep in mind the inconsistent labeling of targeting and tailoring in earlier published articles and to make critical judgments when reading.

|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M.

|Middle Ages and Renaissance||The incidence of tuberculosis grows progressively in these times, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers move to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Europe, tuberculosis is known as the “king’s evil” and is widely believed that the kings of England and France can cure ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]]'' simply by touching those affected.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Tuberculosis.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].
|-
|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed. Several international conferences are held, focusing on the fundamental, biological, clinical and social aspects of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.theunion.org/who-we-are/history|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1980s onward||Tuberculosis [[antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains appear, provoking a rise in incidence in countries like [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Also, the association with [[AIDS]] has contributed to the rise of tuberculosis in some sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuberculosis (TB) and other mycobacterial diseases: diagnosis, screening, management and data|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-other-mycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Present||Today, tuberculosis continues to be a top infectious disease killer worldwide. However, the death rate has dropped 47% since 1990. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries, with the most severe burden in Africa.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; At least 1 million children fall ill with tuberculosis each year, represent about 11% of all cases.&lt;ref name="ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN|url=http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/childhood_tb_informationsheet.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nationalism sidebar |Types}}

'''Transnationalism''' is a [[social phenomenon]] and scholarly research agenda grown out of the heightened interconnectivity between [[people]] and the receding economic and social significance of boundaries among nation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Pamela|title=Reimagining the Nation and Defining the District: Dominican Migration and Transnational Politics|year=1997|publisher=Patricia Pessar|location=Caribbean Circuits: New Directions in the Study of Caribbean Migration, Center for Migration Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|title=The Transnational Villagers|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vertovec|first=Steven|title=Transnationalism and Identity|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|year=2001|volume=27|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.1080/13691830120090386|url=http://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/estudiospoliticos/article/view/21942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castles|first=Stephen|title=Global Perspectives on Forced Migration|year=2005|publisher=Refugee Studies Centre|location=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Trans-National" was popularized in the early 20th century by writer [[Randolph Bourne]] to describe a new way of thinking about relationships between cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Randolph S.|title=Trans-National America |journal=Atlantic Monthly |issue=118| pages=86–97|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term itself was coined by a colleague in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Randolph S.|title=The Jew and Tran-national America|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster Dictionary states 1921 was the year the term "transnational" was first used in print, which was after Bourne's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transnationalism | title=Definition of TRANSNATIONALISM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnationalism as an [[economic]] process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs.  Economic transnationalism, commonly known as [[globalization]], was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by [[containerization]].  [[Multinational corporations]] could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.

Proponents of capitalists transnationalism seek to facilitate the flow of people, ideas, and goods among [[regions]]. They believe that it has increasing relevance with the rapid growth of capitalist globalization. They contend that it does not make sense to link specific nation-state boundaries with for instance migratory [[labor force|workforces]], globalized [[corporation]]s, global money flow, global information flow, and global scientific cooperation.

However, critical theories of transnationalism have argued that transnational capitalism has occurred through the increasing monopolization and centralization of capital by leading dominant groups in the global economy and various power blocs.  Scholars critical of global capitalism (and its global ecological and inequality crises) have argued instead for a transnationalism from below between workers and co-operatives as well as popular social and political movements.{{sfn|Robinson|2004}}

Transnationalism as concept, theory and experience has nourished an important literature in social sciences. In practice transnationalism refers to increasing functional integration of processes that cross-borders or according to others trans bordered relations of individuals, groups, firms and to mobilizations beyond state boundaries. Individuals, groups, institutions and states interact with each other in a new global space where cultural and political characteristic of national societies are combined with emerging multilevel and multinational activities. Transnationalism is a part of the process of capitalist globalization. The concept of transnationalism refers to multiple links and interactions linking people and institutions across the borders of [[nation-states]]. Although much of the more recent literature has focused on popular protest as a form of transnational activism, some research has also drawn attention to clandestine and criminal networks, as well as foreign fighters, as examples of a wider form of transnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Cerwyn|date=2015-05-27|title=Foreign Bodies: Transnational Activism, the Insurgency in the North Caucasus and "Beyond"|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=27|issue=3|pages=395–415|doi=10.1080/09546553.2015.1032035|issn=0954-6553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that [[diaspora]]s, such as the [[overseas Chinese]], are a historical [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] to modern transnationalism. However, unlike some people with transnationalist lives, most diasporas have not been voluntary. The field of [[diaspora politics]] does consider modern diasporas as having the potential to be transnational political actors and be influenced by transnational political forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kislev|first=Elyakim|title=The transnational effect of multicultural policies on migrants' identification: the case of the Israeli diaspora in the USA|doi=10.1111/glob.12043|volume=15|year=2014|journal=Global Networks|pages=118–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term "transnationalism" emphasizes the ways in which nations are no longer able to contain or control the disputes and negotiations through which social groups annex a global dimension to their meaningful practices, the notion of diaspora brings to the fore the racial dynamics underlying  the [[international division of labor]] and the economic turmoil of [[global capital]]. In an article published in 2006, Asale Angel-Ajani claimed that "there is the possibility within [[diaspora studies]] to move away from the politically sanitized discourse that surrounds transnational studies". Since [[African diaspora]] studies have focused on [[racial formation]], [[racism]], and [[white supremacy]], [[diaspora theory]] has the potential to bring to transnationalism "a varied political, if not radical political, perspective to the study of transnational processes and—globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angel-Ajani|first=Asale|chapter=Displacing Diaspora: Trafficking, African Women, and Transnational Practices|title=Diasporic Africa: A Reader|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What drives transnationalism ==

Different approaches have attempted to explain this. Some argue that the main driver of transnationalism has been the development of technologies that have made transportation and communication more accessible and affordable, thus dramatically changing the relationship between people and places. It is now possible for immigrants to maintain closer and more frequent contact with their home societies than ever before.
However, the integration of international migrations to the demographic future of many developed countries is another important driver for transnationalism. Beyond simply filling a demand for low-wage workers, migration also fills the demographic gaps created by declining natural populations in most industrialized countries. Today, migration accounts for 3/5 of population growth on western countries as a whole. And this trend shows no sign of slowing down. 
Moreover, global political transformations and new international legal regimes have weakened the state as the only legitimate source of rights. [[Decolonization]], coupled with the fall of [[communism]] and the ascendance of [[human rights]], have forced states to take account of persons qua persons, rather than persons qua citizens. As a result, individuals have rights regardless of their citizenship status within a country.
Others, from a neo-marxist approach, argue that transnational class relations have come about which have occurred concomitant with novel organizational and technological advancements and the spread of transnational chains of production and finance.

== Immigrant transnational activities ==

When immigrants engage in transnational activities, they create "social fields" that link their original country with their new country or countries of residence. "We have defined transnationalism as the process by which immigrants build social fields that link together their country of origin and their country of settlement".{{sfn|Schiller|Basch|Blanc-Szanton|1992|p=1}} These social fields are the product of a series of interconnected and overlapping economic, political, and socio-cultural activities:

=== Economic transnational activities ===
Economic transnational activities such as business investments in home countries and monetary [[remittances]] are both pervasive and well documented. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that in 2006 immigrants living in developed countries sent home the equivalent of $300 billion in remittances, an amount more than double the level of international aid. This intense influx of resources may mean that for some nations development prospects become inextricably linked—if not dependent upon—the economic activities of their respective [[diasporas]].

=== Political transnational activities ===
Political transnational activities can range from retained membership in political parties in one’s country of origin and voting in its elections to even running for political office. Less formal but still significant roles include the transfer or dissemination of political ideas and norms, such as publishing an op-ed in a home country newspaper, writing a blog, or lobbying a local elected official. There is also the more extreme example of individuals such as Jesus Galvis, a travel agent in New Jersey who in 1997 ran for a Senate seat in his native Colombia. He was elected and intended to hold office simultaneously in Bogota and Hackensack, New Jersey where he served as a city councilor.

=== Political economy ===
The rise of global capitalism has occurred through a novel and increasingly functional integration of capitalist chains of production and finance across borders which is tied to the formation of a transnational capitalist class.{{sfn|Robinson|2004}}{{sfn|Sklair|2000}} This approach has led to a broader study of corporate networks, the global working class{{sfn|Struna|2009}} and the transnationalization of state apparatuses and elites.{{sfn|Robinson|2012}}{{sfn|Sprague|2012}}

=== Socio-cultural transnational activities ===
Transnationalism is an analytic lens used to understand immigrant and minority populations as a meeting of multiple simultaneous histories.&lt;ref&gt;Arif Dirlik (1996) Asian on the Rim: Transnational Capital and Local Community in the Making of Contemporary Asian America. Amerasia Journal: 1996, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Socio-cultural transnational activities cover a wide array of social and cultural transactions through which ideas and meanings are exchanged. Recent research has established the concept and importance of social remittances which provide a distinct form of social capital between migrants living abroad and those who remain at home.&lt;ref name="Levitt"/&gt; These transfers of socio-cultural meanings and practices occur either during the increased number of visits that immigrants take back to their home countries or visits made by non-migrants to friends and families living in the receiving countries or through the dramatically increased forms of correspondence such as emails, online chat sessions, telephone calls, CDs/ VDOs, and traditional letters.

In the late 1980s, [[ethnic studies]] scholars would largely move towards models of [[diaspora]] to understand immigrant communities in relation to [[area studies]], although lone patterns of international flow would become accompanied by the multiple flows of transnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Okamura (2003) Asian American Studies in the Age of Transnationalism: Diaspora, Race, Community. Amerasia Journal: 2003, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 171-194.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to say that immigrants build social fields that link those abroad with those back home is not to say that their lives are not firmly rooted in a particular place and time. Indeed, they are as much residents of their new community as anyone else.

Transnationalism is criticized for being too far removed from ethnic studies' efforts to empower solidarity in minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Yang Murray (2000) Oral History Research, Theory, and Asian American Studies. Amerasia Journal: 2000, Vol. 26, No. 1, pp. 105-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Okamura (2003) Asian American Studies in the Age of Transnationalism: Diaspora, Race, Community. Amerasia Journal: 2003, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 171-194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asian American Studies]] provides a counterargument in that its inception was based in comparative analysis of the racial discrimination against Asian Americans and Vietnamese during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn K. Omatsu, “The ‘Four Prisons’ and the Movements of Liberation: Asian American Activism from the 1960s to the 1990s,” in Karin Aguilar-San Juan, ed., The State of Asian America: Activism and Resistance in the 1990s (Boston: South End Press, 1994), 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==

Transnationalism has significant implications for the way we conceptualize [[immigration]]. Traditionally, immigration has been seen as an autonomous process, driven by conditions such as poverty and overpopulation in the country of origin and unrelated to conditions (such as foreign policy and economic needs) in the receiving country. Even though overpopulation, [[economic stagnation]], and poverty all continue to create pressures for migration, they alone are not enough to produce large [[international migration]] flows. There are many countries, for example, which lack significant emigration history despite longstanding poverty. Also, most international immigration flows from the global South to the global North are not made up by the poorest of the poor, but, generally by professionals. In addition, there are countries with high levels of job creation that continue to witness emigration on a large scale.

The reasons and promoters for migration are not only embodied within the country of origin. Instead, they are rooted within the broader geopolitical and global dynamics. Significant evidence of geographic migration patterns suggests that receiving countries become home to immigrants from the receiving country's zone of influence. Then, immigration is but a fundamental component of the process of capitalist expansion, market penetration, and globalization. There are systematic and structural relations between globalization and immigration.

The emergence of a [[global economy]] has contributed both to the creation of potential emigrants abroad and to the formation of economic, cultural, and ideological links between industrialized and developing countries that later serve as bridges for the international migration. For example, the same set of circumstances and processes that have promoted the location of factories and offices abroad have also contributed to the creation of large supply of low-wage jobs for which immigrant workers constitute a desirable labor supply. Moreover, the decline of manufacturing jobs and the growth of the service sector, key drivers of the globalization of production, have transformed western economies’ occupational and income structure.

Unlike the manufacturing sector, which traditionally supplied middle-income jobs and competitive benefits, the majority of service jobs are either extremely well-paid or extremely poorly paid, with relatively few jobs in the middle-income range. Many of the jobs lack key benefits such as health insurance. Sales representatives, restaurant wait staff, administrative assistants, and custodial workers are among the growth occupations.

Finally, the fact that the major growth sectors rather than declining sectors are generating the most low-wage jobs shows that the supply of such jobs will continue to increase for the predictable future. The entry of migrant workers will similarly continue to meet the demand. In turn, this inflow provides the raw material out of which transnational communities emerge.

The '''United Regions Organization / Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (ORU Fogar)''' is an [[international organization]], which aims to bring together regions from all over the world and represents them before other international organizations in order to boost a global policy of balanced [[Economic development|development]] and territorial cohesion.

The Organization's main objective is to seek the regions' recognition as major players in [[global governance]]. ORU Fogar defends that states' [[decentralization]] power towards other actors accelerates development; consequently fostering [[democracy]] by the proximity between these new actors and the citizens. ORU Fogar promotes a model based on a strong [[regional government]], with legally recognized capabilities and competences and also budgets in compliance with those competences. Amongst its members, ORU Fogar has important European and Latin American regions, as well as regional governments from Africa and Asia.

The organization acts according to two approaches:
* An integrated approach generated in the territories to design and implement in the field solutions to the new challenges that these territories are facing.
* The promotion of new governance rules at a global level, including the regional scale, allowing the development of this territorial approach.

== Objectives ==
ORU Fogar's founding objectives can be wrapped up into three main topics: To '''raise the voice of regions before all of the international bodies''', through the association of regions from all over the world in order to work together for development; to '''defend a new global governance''' where regions have a relevant role in encouraging the participation of regional governments in the creation of new policies and '''work for regions''' in order for national governments to take into account the regional dimensión and cultural diversity, through the promotion of competitiveness and regional growth, but always trying to follow a sustainable development and respect for climate approach.

== History ==
[[File:Buró ORU Montevideo.jpg|thumb|315x315px|ORU Fogar's Executive Bureau at Montevideo (2015)]]
Facing the new global situation, [[region]]s gathered to achieve a coordinated response to the current challenges in a worldwide association. That meeting was named "Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (FOGAR)", held in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in August 2007. It was conducted on the basis of the "Declaration of the Regions on their participation in the governance of [[globalization]]" signed in [[Marseille]], PACA, [[France]], on the occasion of the first international convention for a regional approach to development. Seventeen networks of regions from all continents were the founders of the Organization, with a representation of more than 900 subnational governments. Since July 2010, membership in ORU Fogar is also opened to regions and [[federated state]]s individually.

'''Willis Clark Conover, Jr.''' (December 18, 1920 – May 17, 1996) was a [[jazz]] producer and broadcaster on the [[Voice of America]] for over forty years. He produced jazz concerts at the [[White House]], the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and for movies and television. By arranging concerts where people of all races were welcome, he is credited with desegregating Washington D.C. nightclubs.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Robert McG. Thomas Jr., [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/us/willis-conover-is-dead-at-75-aimed-jazz-at-the-soviet-bloc.html?pagewanted=1 "Willis Conover Is Dead at 75; Aimed Jazz at the Soviet Bloc"], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 19, 1996. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover is credited with keeping interest in jazz alive in the countries of Eastern Europe through his nightly broadcasts during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Ripmaster 2007" /&gt;

== Youth ==
As a young man Conover was interested in science fiction, and published a [[science fiction fanzine]], ''Science Fantasy Correspondent''. This brought him into contact with [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The correspondence between Lovecraft, who was at the end of his life, and the young Conover, has been published as ''Lovecraft at Last'' (Carrolton-Clark, 1975; reprint 2004).

Conover's father had intended for him to attend [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] and follow his family's tradition of military service. Instead, he attended the [[Salisbury University|Maryland State Teacher's College]] at [[Salisbury, Maryland]], and became a radio announcer for [[WTBO]] in [[Cumberland, Maryland]].

He later moved to Washington, D.C., and focused on jazz in his programming, especially the [[Duke Ellington]] hour on Saturday nights.  His guests on this program and Saturday morning shows included many important artists, such as [[Boyd Raeburn]].

== Voice of America ==

[[File:Conover.poland 1.jpg|left|thumb|Conover's first arrival in Poland (1959)]]
Conover came to work at the [[Voice of America]], and eventually became a legend among jazz lovers, primarily due to the hour-long program on the Voice of America called ''[[Voice of America Jazz Hour]]''. Known for his sonorous [[baritone]] voice, many would argue that he was the most important presenter on Voice of America. His slow delivery and the use of scripts written in "special English" made his programmes more widely accessible and he is said to have become the first teacher of English to a whole generation of East European jazz lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], ''Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2006, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover was not well known in the United States, even among jazz aficionados, as the Voice of America did not broadcast domestically except on [[shortwave]], but his visits to Eastern Europe and [[Soviet Union]] brought huge crowds and star treatment for him.
He was a celebrity figure in the Soviet Union, where jazz was very popular and the Voice of America was a prime source of information as well as music.

In 1956, Conover conducted a series of interviews with jazz luminaries like [[Duke Ellington]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Stan Kenton]], [[Benny Goodman]], and [[Art Tatum]].  His interview with Tatum is noted as "the only known in-depth recorded interview with the pianist".  These interviews were selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as a 2010 addition to the [[National Recording Registry]], which selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2010reg.html | title=The National Recording Registry 2010 | accessdate=April 10, 2011 | publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

He died of lung cancer. He had been a smoker for 57 years.&lt;ref name=CER&gt;James Lester, [http://www.ce-review.org/99/5/music5_lester.html "Willis of Oz"], ''[[Central Europe Review]]'', Vol. 1, No. 5, July 26, 1999. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1990, Conover was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/conover-willis-clark-jr&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[University of North Texas]] announced its Willis Conover Collection would make digitized copies of Conover's programs available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Doug | last=Ramsey | title=The Willis Conover Archive Is Online | series=Rifftides | website=ArtsJournal | url=http://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2015/09/the-willis-conover-archive-is-online.html | accessdate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41055">The '''World Archery Rankings''' is a ranking system developed by the [[World Archery Federation]] for [[Modern competitive archery|international competitive archery]]. It is calculated using a points system and published following major [[World Archery Federation|World Archery]] tournaments.

The ranking system was first developed in 2001, and calculation method updated in 2010. At present, rankings are maintained for:
* '''[[Recurve bow|Recurve archery]]''': ''Men's Individual, Women's Individual, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team''
* '''[[Compound bow|Compound archery]]''': ''Men's Individual, Women's Individual, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team''
* '''Para-archery''': ''Recurve Men W2, Recurve Men Standing, Compound Men W1, Compound Men Open, Recurve Women W2, Recurve Women Standing, Compound Women Open, Visually Impaired Open''
* '''Nations''': ''National rankings based on all disciplines''

From 2006, rankings were calculated for [[Field Archery]], but since 2012 are no longer maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archeryranking.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=652&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==

Each archer or team earns a ranking score for each competition. The ranking scores are calculated through a combination of the ranking factor of the tournament ("Ranking Factor") and points based on the competitor's final position in the competition ("Ranking Score"). The archer's four highest ranking scores are then combined to form their total score ("Added Ranking Score"), which forms the basis of the ranking list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Results/World%20Ranking/WorldRanking_CalculationSystem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228065232/http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Results/World%20Ranking/WorldRanking_CalculationSystem.pdf |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranking Factor===
Only results achieved at official ranking events can count towards the overall rankings. These events include the major [[World Archery Federation]] tournaments ([[Archery at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]], [[World Archery Championships]], [[FITA Archery World Cup|World Cup]]), and other international, regional and national events that have applied and been approved for ranking status.

The tournament ranking factor is calculated on the basis of three sub-factors, Quality, Quantity and Period, which are multiplied together to produce the overall tournament factor. The factor can vary between disciplines at the same event (e.g., the recurve and compound disciplines at the World Championships may have different Ranking Factors).

For instance, the Ranking Factor of a tournament for individuals with 60 archers, of whom 10 are in the top 50, that took place 18 months ago, would be:

'''2.5''' ''("Quality": 9-12 top 50 archers)'' x

'''0.9''' ''("Quantity": 33-64 archers)'' x

'''0.5''' ''("Period": other tournament 12-24 months ago)'' =

'''''1.125'''''

====Quality====
The Quality sub-factor takes into account the level of competition at the tournament. A score is assigned based on the prestige of the event, for the major [[World Archery Federation]] tournaments, and the number of top archers or teams at other competitions (defined as individuals ranked in the top 50 or teams ranked in the top 16). The quality factor points are assigned as follows:

====Period====
The Period sub-factor is dependent on when the competition took place, allowing the Ranking Factor to emphasise the most recent tournaments as follows:

{| cellspacing="1" style="border:1px solid #aaa; font-size:90%;"
|- style="background:#e4e4e4;"

|}

===Ranking Points===

Ranking Points are awarded based on the team or competitor's final position at the competition. This is then multiplied by the Ranking Factor to produce the overall Ranking Score for that team or competitor at that tournament. For instance, an archer who finished 4th in the competition used in the example above would receive the following Ranking Score:

'''1.125''' ''("Ranking Factor")'' x

'''12''' ''("Ranking Points": 4th place)'' =

'''''13.5'''''

A team or competitor's best four Ranking Scores are then combined to produce the Added Ranking Score, which forms the basis of the  rankings list. No more than two Ranking Scores whose period factor is lower than 1 may be used to calculate the Added Ranking Score.

Ranking Points are awarded as follows:

[[File:Indian Navy - World Environment Day - 2016 (1).jpg|thumb|World Environment Day in India]]
'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
For almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving change. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:
===2018===
The theme for 2018 is "Beat Plastic Pollution".

The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a [[list of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]] that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, and is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 22 July 1946. It incorporated the {{lang|fr|[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]|italic=no}} and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its establishment, it has played a leading role in the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable disease]]s, in particular [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; the mitigation of the effects of [[non-communicable disease]]s such as sexual and [[reproductive health]], development, and aging; nutrition, [[food security]] and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking.

The WHO is responsible for the [[World Health Report]], the worldwide [[World Health Survey]], and [[World Health Day]]. The current Director-General of the WHO is [[Tedros Adhanom]], who started his five-year term on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |title=Dr Tedros takes office as WHO Director-General |date=1 July 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The [[International Sanitary Conferences]], originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases, chief among them [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and the [[bubonic plague]]. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892; when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed. Five years later, a convention for the plague was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |title=The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences, 1851–1938 |last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]], and the {{lang|fr|Office International d'Hygiène Publique|italic=no}} were soon founded in 1902 and 1907, respectively. When the [[League of Nations]] was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. After [[World War II]], the United Nations absorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Michael |date=October 2002 |title=A brief history of the World Health Organization |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067360211244X.pdf |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=360 |issue=9340 |pages=1111–12 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11244-x|pmid=12387972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, [[Szeming Sze]], a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, [[Alger Hiss]], the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health.&lt;ref name="Pitt ULS"&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 Sze Szeming Papers, 1945–2014, UA.90.F14.1], University Archives, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302|pmc=1614381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Move towards a New Health Organization: International Health Conference |journal=Chronicle of the World Health Organization |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–11 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |format=PDF |year=1947 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031008/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.&lt;ref name="shimkin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281|pmid=17810349 |pmc=1614381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1016.3166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947/&gt; The first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of {{US$|5 million}} (then {{GBP|1250000}}) for the 1949 year.

===Operational history===
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]
In 1947 the WHO established an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information service via [[telex]], and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] inoculation drive using the [[BCG vaccine]] was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref name="at60"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.&lt;ref name= Fenner2&gt;{{cite book |last=Fenner |first=Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication |series=History of International Public Health |volume=6 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1966, the WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the [[Palace of Nations]] to a newly constructed HQ elsewhere in Geneva.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|title=Construction of the main WHO building|year=2016|website=who.int|publisher=WHO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611011659/http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|archive-date=2018-06-11|dead-url=no|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4&amp;nbsp;million annually to the effort and adopted a new [[disease surveillance]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |first=Vladimír |last=Zikmund  |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |journal=Central European Journal of Public Health |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=55–56 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20586232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |last1=Holland |first=Walter W. |title=Karel Raška – The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

In 1974, the [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] and the control programme of [[onchocerciasis]] was started, an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the [[World Bank]].

In 1977, the first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of "[[Health For All]]" was declared.

In 1986, the WHO began its global programme on [[HIV/AIDS]]. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 [[UNAIDS]] was formed.

In 1988, the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established.&lt;ref name="at60" /&gt;

In 1998, WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced [[infant mortality]], increased life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Stop TB Partnership]] was created along with the UN's formulation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In 2001 the [[measles]] initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] was drawn up to improve the resources available.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt; In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Mu Xuequan |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |website=chinaview.cn |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall focus===
The WHO's Constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution: (a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work; (b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate; (c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services; (d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments; (e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services; (g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries; (i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{As of |2012}}, the WHO has defined its role in public health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* providing technical support, catalyzing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.
* [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] to provide monitoring of vital events (birth, death, wedding, divorce).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/en/|title=Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)|website=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===
The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 5 areas among which funding was distributed.&lt;ref name="20123budget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those five areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

As of 2015, the WHO has worked within the [[UNAIDS]] network and strived to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether [[RTS,S]]/AS01, were a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]s and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]], and since 2005, over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7&amp;nbsp;million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |website=WHO work mediacenter|publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate [[polio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since which partnered WHO with [[Rotary International]], the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), and smaller organizations. {{As of| 2011}}, it has been working to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study was conducted where why Polio Vaccines may not be enough to eradicate the Virus &amp; conduct new technology. Polio is now on the verge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Non-communicable diseases===
Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature deaths from chronic [[noncommunicable disease]]s, [[mental disorder]]s, violence and [[injury prevention|injuries]], and [[visual impairment]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Life-course Sexual and Reproductive Health has published the magazine, ''Entre Nous'', across Europe since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Entre Nous'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715203751/http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | archive-date = 15 July 2017 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | website = euro.who.int | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | oclc = 782375711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental health===
The WHO estimates that 12.6&amp;nbsp;million people died as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in 2012 –  this accounts for nearly 1 in 4 of total global deaths. Environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures, climate change, and ultraviolet radiation, contribute to more than 100 diseases and injuries. This can result in a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An estimated 12.6&amp;nbsp;million deaths each year are attributable to unhealthy environments |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/deaths-attributable-to-unhealthy-environments/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life course and life style===
WHO works to "reduce [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the [[Infant|neonatal period]], [[childhood]] and adolescence, and improve [[Sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]] and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218011849/http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |archive-date=18 February 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for "health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, [[drugs]] and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and [[unsafe sex]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO works to improve nutrition, [[food safety]] and [[food security]] and to ensure this has a positive effect on [[public health]] and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

===Surgery and trauma care===

The WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/ Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/surgery/globalinitiative/en/ |title=Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care |publisher=WHO |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trauma care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/emergencycare/trauma/essential-care/en/ |title=Essential trauma care project |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency work===
The World Health Organization's primary objective in natural and man-made emergencies is to coordinate with member states and other stakeholders to "reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability."&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="AP-20140505"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff Writer--&gt; |title=UN: Spread of polio now an world health emergency |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140505/eu-med-polio-emergency-6e6900dc37.html |date=5 May 2014 |location=London |agency=[[AP News]] |publisher=Mindspark Interactkookve Network, Inc. |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140505"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladstone |first=Rick |title=Polio Spreading at Alarming Rates, World Health Organization Declares |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/world-health-organization-polio-health-emergency.html |date=5 May 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of [[Ebola]] was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=Kate |last1=Kelland |first2=Felix |last2=Onuah |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/us-health-ebola-africa-idUSKBN0G81Q820140808 |title=WHO declares Ebola an international health emergency |location=London/Lagos |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health policy===
WHO addresses government [[health policy]] with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform [[health policy]] options. It oversees the implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]], and publishes a series of [[medical classification]]s; of these, three are over-reaching "reference classifications": the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) and the [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] (adopted in 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (adopted in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]] (adopted in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt; WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their use of and their reporting about their use of research evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, S.J., Lavis, J.N. &amp; Bennett, S., 2009. The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems. Healthcare Policy, 5(1), pp.66–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;
* "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda"; and
* "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".

====Partnerships====
The WHO along with the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development co-operation into practice in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=International Health Partnership |publisher=IHP+ |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work, such as the [[WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/en/ |title=WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231145418/http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874|archivedate=31 December 2016|title=WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy: Seventh Report |website=WHO Press Office |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Interprofessional education#WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice|WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/professionals/coordination/en/index.html |title=WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice |publisher=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, targeted at improving [[health policy]] and [[health system|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/en/index.html |title=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the [[HINARI]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ |title=HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme |publisher=Who.int |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO collaborates with the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. 

WHO created the Civil Society Reference Group on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which brings together other networks that are involved in policy making and the dissemination of guidelines.

WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world.

WHO facilitates technical partnerships through the Technical Advisory Committee on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Technical Advisory Committee on HIV|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which they created to develop WHO guidelines and policies.

====Public health education and action====
Each year, the organization marks [[World Health Day]] and other observances focusing on a specific [[health promotion]] topic. World Health Day falls on 7 April each year, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding. Recent themes have been [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]] (2014), healthy ageing (2012) and [[drug resistance]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/world-health-day/en/ |title=World Health Day – 7 April |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]], and [[World AIDS Day]].

As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/about/en/index.html |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf |title=Accelerating progress towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals |year=2010 |format=PDF |page=2 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data handling and publications===
The World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well-being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/ |title=WHO World Health Survey |publisher=WHO |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health|Study on Global Aging and Adult Health]]'' (SAGE) covering over 50,000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sage/en/index.html |title=WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) |publisher=WHO |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Country Health Intelligence Portal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Health Policy Process|url=http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|accessdate=4 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121222652/http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|archivedate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it.

The WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national [[health system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: a handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/index.htm |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Health Human Resources|health workforces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health |publisher=WHO |year=2009 |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Observatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Health Observatory|url=http://www.who.int/gho/en/index.html|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS), the ''WHO Quality of Life Instrument'' (WHOQOL), and the ''Service Availability and Readiness Assessment'' (SARA) provide guidance for data collection.&lt;ref&gt;See respectively:*{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/index.html |title=Mental Health: WHO-AIMS |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf  |title=WHOQOL-BREF: Introduction, Administration, Scoring and Generic Version of the Assessment |format=PDF |year=1996 |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sara_introduction/en/ |title=Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the [[Health Metrics Network]], also aim to provide sufficient high-quality information to assist governmental decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatishmn/en/index.html |title=What is HMN? |website=Health Metrics Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs, including through the [[Evidence-Informed Policy Network]] (EVIPNet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/rpc/evipnet/en/ |title=Evidence-Informed Policy Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1414&amp;Itemid=931 |title=Policy on Research for Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as [[MiNDbank]], went online. The database was launched on [[Human Rights Day]], and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights, and the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being implemented in different countries.&lt;ref name=MiNDbank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/mindbank-20131210/en/ |title=Mental health information at your fingertips – WHO launches the MiNDbank |publisher=Who.int |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains important international documents and information. The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review policies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health.&lt;ref name="MiNDbank"/&gt;

The WHO regularly publishes a ''[[World Health Report]]'', its leading publication, including an expert assessment of a specific [[global health]] topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/whr/en/index.html |title=The World Health Report |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications of WHO include the ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/en/ |title=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]'' (overseen by EMRO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emro.who.int/emhj.htm |title=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'' (published in collaboration with [[BioMed Central]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human-resources-health.com/ |title=Human Resources for Health |publisher=BioMed Central |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pan American Journal of Public Health]]'' (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/journal/ |title=Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|title=Global health sector strategy on HIV, 2016–2021|website=World Health Organization|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with interim targets for the year 2020. In order to make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic. 

==Structure==
The World Health Organization is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=9 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
[[File:World Health Organization membership status map.png|thumb|right|Countries by World Health Organization membership status]]
{{As of|2016}}, the WHO has 194 member states: all of them Member States of the United Nations except for the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]].&lt;ref name="countries"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/countries/en/ |title=Countries |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.) {{As of|2013}}, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and [[Tokelau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 1, Members of the World Health Organization (at 31&amp;nbsp;May 2009)|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries have been granted [[observer status]]. [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is an observer as a "national liberation movement" recognized by the [[League of Arab States]] under United Nations Resolution 3118. The [[Holy See]] also attends as an observer, as does the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]].&lt;ref name="observerWHO"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xou_nD9jJF0C |title=World Health Organization |first1=Gian Luca |last1=Burci |first2=Claude-Henri  |last2=Vignes |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-411-2273-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Taiwan was invited under the name of "Republic of China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=103148&amp;ctnode=427&amp;mp=9 |title=Taiwan Today, Taiwan delegation to participate in WHA |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".&lt;ref name="countries"/&gt; Liechtenstein is currently the only UN member not in the WHO membership.

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated alongside the other NGOs.&lt;ref name="observerWHO"/&gt;

===World Health Assembly and Executive Board===
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face 2.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.&lt;ref name="governance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of the executive board is Dr. [[Assad Hafeez]].

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.&lt;ref name="burci53"&gt;{{harvnb|Burci|Vignes|2004|pages=53–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognized. For example, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional office]]. Each region also has a regional office.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions|website=|publisher=WHO|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011220426/http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

|}
The head of the organization is the Director-General, elected by the [[World Health Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/|title=WHO Governance|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lasts for 5 years, and Director-Generals are typically appointed in May, when the Assembly meets. The current Director-General is Dr. [[Tedros Adhanom]] Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employees ===
The WHO employs 8,500 people in 147 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we are |url= http://www.who.int/employment/about_who/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the principle of a tobacco-free work environment, the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we need|url=http://www.who.int/employment/who_we_need/en/|publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously instigated the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html |title=Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodwill Ambassadors ===
The WHO operates "[[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassadors]]"; members of the arts, sports, or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO's initiatives and projects. There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors ([[Jet Li]], [[Nancy Brinker]], [[Peng Liyuan]], [[Yohei Sasakawa]] and the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project ([[Craig David]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/goodwill_ambassadors/en/ |title=Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country and liaison offices===
The World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/index.html |title=WHO its people and offices |publisher=WHO |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the [[European Union]], United Nations and a single office covering the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. It also operates the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] in [[Lyon]], France, and the [[WHO Centre for Health Development]] in [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offices include those in [[Pristina]]; the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of Serbia; there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"/&gt; The WR is member of the [[United Nations System|UN system]] country team which is coordinated by the UN System [[Resident Coordinator]].

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices" /&gt; The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title = WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing and partnerships ===
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&amp;nbsp;million), Japan ($58&amp;nbsp;million), Germany ($37&amp;nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&amp;nbsp;million) and France ($31&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title = Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format = PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&amp;nbsp;million, of which $944&amp;nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&amp;nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&amp;nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2002}}, a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal "official relations" – the rest being considered informal in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/livingproofproject/Pages/gavi.aspx |title=Living Proof Project: Partner Profile |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundations |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance |title=World Health Organization's Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research |publisher=Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate=31 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710062352/https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance|archivedate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the World Health Organization headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in 2008.]]
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). A selective reading of this document (clause 3) can result in the understanding that the IAEA is able to prevent the WHO from conducting research or work on some areas, as seen hereafter. The agreement states here that the WHO recognizes the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds that 

"whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations |url = http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]]) to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. They believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |title=World Health Organization Accomodates &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |work=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928232353/http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However as pointed out by Foreman&lt;ref&gt;M.R.StJ. Foreman, Cogent Chemistry, Reactor accident chemistry an update, 2018, 
10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944, https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944&lt;/ref&gt; in clause 2 it states.

“2. In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its agreement with the United Nations together with the exchange of letters related thereto, and taking into account the respective co-ordinating responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized by the World Health Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the primary responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co- ordinating research and development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world without prejudice to the right of the World Health Organization to concern itself with promoting, developing, assisting and co-ordinating international health work, including research, in all its aspects.”

Clearly suggesting that the WHO is free to do as it sees fit on nuclear, radiation and other matters which relate to health.

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&amp;nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |work=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the [[Catholic Church]] remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], has condemned [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict's]] opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermittent preventive therapy ===
The aggressive support of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized |website=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet and sugar intake ===
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916).&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half and said that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News: WHO: Daily sugar intake 'should be halved'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-26449497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 swine flu pandemic===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts and health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/influenza/clinical_evaluation_tables/en/|title=Tables on clinical evaluation of influenza vaccines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pandemic involving the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1 influenza virus]] was declared by the then Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2009/06/who-declares-pandemic-novel-h1n1-virus|title=WHO declares pandemic of novel H1N1 virus|work=CIDRAP|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/|title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abelina A | year = 2011 | title = Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1) The research-based vaccine industry's perspective | url = http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue =  6| pages = 1135–1138 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.042 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 21115061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009120413/http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | archivedate = 9 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and reform efforts===
Following the [[2014 Ebola outbreak]] in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Split WHO in two: strengthening political decision-making and securing independent scientific advice|journal=Public Health Journal|date=February 2014|volume=128|issue=2|pages=188–194|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.021|pmid=24434035|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(13)00291-6/pdf|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of "core capacity" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100&amp;nbsp;million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|title=Report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|title=WHO Calls For $100 Million Emergency Fund, Doctor 'SWAT Team'}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it had received $26.9&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).  WHO has budgeted an additional $494&amp;nbsp;million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_30-en.pdf|title=Reform of WHO's work in health emergency management / WHO Health Emergencies Programme|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|title=WHO Aims To Reform Itself But Health Experts Aren't Yet Impressed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCTC implementation database===
The WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is one of the only mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220023429/http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database/ |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national implementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report "As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (eg, database indicated “yes” when report indicated “no”), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hoffman S.J. |author2=Rizvi Z. | year = 2012 | title = WHO's Undermining Tobacco Control | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9843| pages = 727–728 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61402-0 | pmid=22920746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IARC controversies ===
{{Further|International Agency for Research on Cancer}}
The World Health Organization sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has been criticized for the way it analyses the tendency of certain substances and activities to cause cancer and for having a politically motivated bias when it selects studies for its analysis. Ed Yong, a British science journalist, has criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Beefing With the World Health Organization's Cancer Warnings|last=Yong|first=Ed|work=The Atlantic|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Kuntz, a French director of research at the&amp;nbsp;[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the agency for its classification of potentially carcinogenic substances. He claimed that this classification did not take into account the extent of exposure: for example, red meat is qualified as probably carcinogenic, but the quantity of consumed red meat at which it could become dangerous is not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slate.fr/story/126602/pourquoi-fausses-sciences-gouvernent-monde|title=Pourquoi les fausses sciences gouvernent le monde (et pourquoi il faut mettre un terme à ce règne)|work=Slate|access-date=29 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies have erupted multiple times when the IARC has classified many things as Class 2a (probable carcinogens), including cell phone signals, [[glyphosate]], drinking hot beverages, and working as a barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-idUSKCN1261WS|title=Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=6 October 2016|agency=Reuters|location=London, U.K.|access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block of Taiwanese participation===
Political pressure from China has led to Taiwan being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in both 2017 and 2018 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the [[World Health Assembly|WHO annual assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China warns Taiwan of continued lockout from WHO assembly|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/china-warns-taiwan-of-continued-lockout-from-who-assembly/2017/05/21/0a486d66-3e58-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Bows to China Pressure, Contravenes Human Rights in Refusing Taiwan Media|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/95982|website=international.thenewslens.com|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, 172 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] wrote to the Director General of the World Health Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Members Push for Taiwan's Participation at World Health Assembly|url=https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/172-members-push-for-taiwans-participation-at-world-health-assembly/|website=foreignaffairs.house.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel expenses===
According to [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], the WHO routinely spends about $200&amp;nbsp;million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Malaria]] combined. In 2016, [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of WHO from November 2006 to June 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 May 2017|location=Geneva|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed in a $1000 per night hotel room while visiting West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/1cf4791dc5c14b9299e0f532c75f63b2/AP-Exclusive:-Health-agency-spends-more-on-travel-than-AIDS| title=Health agency spends more on travel than AIDS| first=Maria| last=Cheng| date=22 May 2017| accessdate=27 June 2017| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Mugabe's role as a goodwill ambassador ===
On 21 October 2017, the Director General [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]] appointed former Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]] as a [[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|WHO Goodwill Ambassador]] to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe.

The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41702662|title=Robert Mugabe's WHO appointment condemned as 'an insult'|date=21 October 2017|work=''BBC News''|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://theglobeandmail.com/news/world/shock-as-zimbabwes-mugabe-named-who-goodwill-ambassador/article36681266/ | title=WHO chief 'rethinking' appointment of Zimbabwe's Mugabe as 'goodwill ambassador' after widespread condemnation | work=The Globe and Mail | date=21 October 2017 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41713919 | title=WHO cancels Robert Mugabe goodwill ambassador role |work=''BBC News''| date=22 October 2017 |  accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World headquarters ==
The seat of the organization is in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. It was designed by Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and inaugurated in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/modernizing-who-headquarters.pdf|title=MODERNIZING THE WHO HEADQUARTERS IN GENEVA|website=who.int|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization launched an international competition to redesign and extend its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/design-contest-opens-for-world-health-organisation-headquarters/8664906.article|title=Design contest opens for World Health Organisation headquarters|work=Architects Journal|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references. Readers need to see the resources for themselves, to see such things as prediction variation, stability, and source. If you are of a mind to do something, just elaborate on the text and spread the references out. It's what I'd do if I had the time, but this exercise has used up as much time as I can spare--&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldPopProspects&gt;

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Five billion===
'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

===Six billion===
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which the [[world population]] reached six billion.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19991012/aponline181217_000.htm |title=World Population Hits 6 billion| author=Edith M.

Demographers do not universally accept this date as being exact.  In fact there has been subsequent research which places the day of six billion nearer to 18 June or 19 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~galen/popclk.html |title=Population Clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Programs division of the United States Census Bureau estimated that the world population reached six billion on 21 April 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  United Nations Population Fund spokesman Omar Gharzeddine disputed the date of the Day of Six Billion by stating, "The U.N. marked the '6 billionth' [person] in 1999, and then a couple of years later the Population Division itself reassessed its calculations and said, actually, no, it was in 1998."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News |url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/28/8525681-7-billion-people-how-do-they-know |title=Cosmic Log – 7 billion people?

==National and regional population==
{{See also|List of population milestones by country}}
National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s. Commentators in countries with high [[immigration]] have pointed out that a population milestone may be reached by an immigrant rather than [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/australias-population-reaches-24-million/7170274|title=Australia's population hits 24 million people, ABS clock shows|date=2016-02-16|work=[[ABC Online]] |quote=The ABS said it was unclear whether the 24 millionth Australian was a newborn or a migrant|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/baby-reed-is-one-in-23-million-almost/story-fngr8hax-1226627384262|title=Baby Reed is one in 23 million as Australia's population hits a milestone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location= Sydney, Australia |quote=He said the 23rd millionth person could be a newborn but could equally be a person coming to work in Australia or a returning backpacker who had been away for more than a year.|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
