      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Antilabe''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀντι "mutually" or "corresponding", λαβή, "grip" or "handle") is a [[rhetoric]]al technique in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] or [[closet drama]], in which a single [[Line (poetry)|verse line]] of dialogue is distributed on two or more [[Character (arts)|characters]], voices, or entities. The verse usually maintains its [[Metre (poetry)|metric]] integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented ("[[dropped line]]") to show the unity of the verse line.

{{Quotation|
'''BRUTUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
:Peace then. No words.
'''CLITUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
::::::::I'll rather kill myself.|
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]|[[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']]}}

These are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in [[blank verse]]:

:Peace '''then'''. No '''words'''. I'll '''ra'''ther '''kill''' my'''self'''.

==In Ancient Greek drama==

"The device originated in [[tragedy|classical tragedy]] as a means of heightening dramatic tension."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, David. ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama''. Volume 1. 1972, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "It figures in almost all the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R. B. ''Greek Tragic Style: Form, Language and Interpretation''. Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sophokles’ ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'', for example, "as ''Kreon'' seizes ''Antigone'' (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of ''antilabe'' in which ''Oedipus'', ''Kreon'', and the chorus participate."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Lowell. ''Theatrical Space and Historical Place in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus''. Maryland, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996,  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "In ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' (1502-3), ''antilabe'' occurs as ''Orestes'' tries to induce ''Aegisthys'' to enter the house so that ''Orestes'' can kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, John E. Jr. ''The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama''. Facts on File (Library of World Literature) 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the plays of [[Aeschylus]], with the possible exception of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca drama==

"Dialogic exchanges using both ''[[stichomythia]]'' and ''antilabe'' are common in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They occur in all the tragedies except ''Phoenissiae''."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, A. J. ed. ''Seneca: Medea: Edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary''. Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Renaissance drama==

David Eggenberger notes that "[the device] was frequently utilized by [[Renaissance]] dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example from Shakespeare is:

{{Quotation|Death?
::My lord?
::::A grave.
::::::He shall not live.|''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', 3.3}}

A '''barker''' also known as a carnival barker was a person who attempted to attract patrons to entertainment events, such as a [[circus]] or [[funfair]], by exhorting passing public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=barker definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPsqBaD?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing attractions of show and emphasizing variety, novelty, beauty, or some other feature believed to incite listeners to attend entertainment. A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as "talkers". {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Perhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s  classic stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], a supporting protagonist from the [[1978 in film|1978]] musical film ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' portrayed by [[Nipsey Russell]]. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s non-musical play ''[[Liliom]]'', on which ''Carousel'' is based.

==In popular culture==
Also the film ''[[The Barker]]'' from 1928 stands for this profession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10503">{{Nihongo||弁士|'''Benshi'''}} were [[Japan]]ese performers who provided live [[narrator|narration]] for [[silent film]]s (both [[Japanese film]]s and [[Western world|Western]] films). ''Benshi'' are sometimes called {{Nihongo4||活動弁士|katsudō-benshi}} or {{Nihongo4||活弁|katsuben}}.&lt;ref&gt;All these forms are abbreviations of {{Nihongo4||活動写真弁士|katsudō-shashin-benshi}}, where {{Nihongo4||活動写真|katsudō-shashin}} means "moving pictures", i.e., an old term for films, and {{Nihongo4||弁士|benshi}} is an orator or public speaker; see {{Cite encyclopedia |title=katsuben |script-title=ja:活弁 |encyclopedia={{Nihongo4||広辞苑|Kōjien}} | edition = 5th | publisher = {{Nihongo4||岩波書店|Iwanami shoten}} | year = 2000 |language=Japanese |postscript = ;}} {{Cite encyclopedia |title=benshi |script-title=ja:弁士 |language=Japanese |encyclopedia = {{Nihongo3|New Japanese-English Dictionary|新和英大辞典|Shin-waei-daijiten}} | edition = 5th | publisher = {{Nihongo4||研究社|Kenkyūsha}} | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==

During silent films, the ''benshi'' stood to the side of the screen and introduced and related the story to the audience. In theatrical style, ''benshi'' often spoke for the characters on-screen and played multiple roles. Stemming from the traditions of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[Noh]]'' theaters, the benshi's narration and general commentary were an important part of the Japanese silent film experience. The ''benshi'' also provided translation for foreign (mostly American) movies.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, Isolde. ''A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film''. New York: Continuum, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8264-1709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like in the West, Japanese silent films were often accompanied by live music (in addition to the ''benshi''). However, unlike Western films, which tended to have a [[theatre organ]] as accompaniment, Japanese films had a score which supported the traditional Japanese instruments of a ''kabuki'' play. Since ''benshi'' performed without external amplification, they had to carefully coordinate with the orchestra to be heard. At that time, theaters typically seated 1000, so a trademark of successful ''benshi'' was the ability to project their voices into large spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Dym, Jeffery (2008). ''A Brief History of Benshi (Silent Film Narrators)''. {{cite web |url=http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/a_brief_history_of_benshi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504044648/http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/a_brief_history_of_benshi |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous benshi active in the silent era include [[Musei Tokugawa]] (at the [[Aoikan]] and [[Musashinokan]] theaters), Saburō Somei (at the [[Denkikan]]), Rakuten Nishimura, [[Raiyū Ikoma]] (at the Teikokukan), [[Mitsugu Ōkura]], and [[Shirō Ōtsuji]].

In the 1995 film ''[[Picture Bride (film)|Picture Bride]],'' [[Toshirō Mifune]] portrays a ''benshi'' who traveled to sugar cane plantations in Hawaii during the early 20th century.

== Influence on film aesthetic ==

As the film industry and art form developed in Japan, the presence of a ''benshi'' came to be part of the film. Benshi read the intertitles on silent films and voiced all on-screen characters. Perhaps most significantly for filmmakers, ''benshi'' would add their own commentary, explaining what was happening in a shot or describing what had happened in confusing edits or sudden transitions. Some ''benshi'' were known to interpret and add to a script, for example reciting poetry to accompany a moving visual.

In addition, it was traditional for the ''benshi'' to introduce the film, even giving a brief lecture about the history of the setting. This meant that filmmakers could assume that a live narrator, accustomed to improvisation, would be present at the showing to explain scenes or even explain missing scenes or unfilmed action.

Perhaps because most early Japanese films were simply ''kabuki'' plays adapted to film, the characterization style ''benshi'' performed roles strongly influenced by the narrators in ''kabuki'' or a ''noh'' chorus—a grave, dramatic, exaggerated style. Due to the influence of ''kabuki'', audiences were not distracted by a single ''benshi'' voicing male and female roles, regardless of the gender of the ''benshi''.

== Influence on film industry ==

In 1927, there were 6,818 ''benshi'', including 180 women.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, David A. (1990). ''A History of Narrative Film'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''benshi'' were famous in their own right and garnered great acclaim. The presence of a ''benshi'' was the aspect of the film presentation that drew in the audience, more so than the actors appearing in the film, and promotional posters would frequently include a photo of the ''benshi'' announcing the movie.

The silent film era lasted until the mid-1930s in Japan in part due to ''benshi'', despite the [[sound film|introduction of sound]] in full-length films in the late 1920s. The adoption of this new technology was slowed by the popularity and influence of the ''benshi'' (in addition to the high costs to the cinemas and production companies). Though the tradition has mostly faded, there are a few remaining active ''benshi'' in Japan (e.g., [[Midori Sawato]]).

== Benshi in other cultures  ==

* ''Benshi'' were present in [[Cinema of Korea|Korea]] from the first decade of the twentieth century where they were called "byeonsa" (변사).&lt;ref&gt;Maliangkay, Roald H.

* In the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], during the early years of the Brezhnev era, the availability of foreign films was severely restricted. [[Goskino|The USSR State Committee for Cinematography]] held closed-door screenings of many Western films, open mainly to workers in the film industry, politicians, and other members of the elite. Those screenings were interpreted simultaneously by interpreters who specialized in films, where an effective conveyance of humour, idioms, and other subtleties of speech were required. Some of the most prolific "[[Gavrilov translation|Gavrilov translators]]" began their careers at such screenings.

== New benshi practice(s) ==

The underlying concept of benshi, live narration of film, continues to work its way into performance practices. The actual practice of "benshi" is most commonly referenced in relation to live film narration largely due to it having been and when the practice was more formalized and financed. As evidenced by the (above) listings of "benshi" in other cultures, the art of cinema accompanied by a live performer was as international then as it is now. 

There are groups in the United States seeking to revive this form and to continue exploring the possibilities of altering the form in the spirit of experimentation from which the practice emerged.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Likewise, new attempts to subvert traditional notions of storytelling and film watching are underway. Some performers interject commentary into films, drawing from a century of social critique, often presenting popular films along with new dialog and narrative intended to juxtapose their ideas with those of the audience. While some have adopted the term "[[Neo-Benshi]]", other performers have chosen to adopt the title "movieteller" as an alternative. They believe it emphasizes the multicultural past and future(s) of the form, while inviting further experimentation with the medium, such as a live narration of one's own films, the implementation of instruments as narrative devices, or any instance where a human contingent mediates between an audience and an image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9205">The '''blow book''', better known as a '''magic coloring book''' in modern variations, is a classic [[magic trick]] that has been performed for hundreds of years. It was most popular from the [[16th]] to the [[19th]] century, when variations of the concept were a staple of the [[publishing|book publishing]] trade. It has been referred to as the oldest example of a manufactured [[Theatrical property|prop]] used for magic. It remains a common trick today, albeit mostly performed for children, preferably at birthday parties or other events due to the visual nature of the illusion.

==Effect==
The magician presents a book and [[Shuffling|riffles]] through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a [[Card flourish|flourish]] is performed, normally involving [[audience participation]], originally having an audience member blow on the outside of the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed completely into different images depending on the nature of the book.

==History==
The blow book is one of the oldest magic tricks. It has a history that is well-documented in historical sources,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=9}} because the trick is based on a device that was only really practical after the widespread introduction of the [[printing press]] in 1450, which created a market for inexpensive paper and binding that the trick relies upon.

The earliest known mention of the concept was by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1550, who described the trick by mentioning "conjurors show different and always unlike pictures in one and the same book".{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}} Another early mention is by [[Reginald Scot]] in his book ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', published in 1584. This work examined witchcraft and revealed the tricks involved, ultimately concluding that witchcraft was not real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clements.umich.edu/exhibits/online/bannedbooks/entry2.html "Reginald Scot, The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584)"] Clements Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Almond, [http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx "England's First Demonologist: Reginald Scot and 'The Discoverie of Witchcraft'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114907/http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx |date=August 26, 2014 }}, I.B.Tauris, 2011, inside cover&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this discussion he mentions the use of blow books, and goes on to describe how to prepare a book that the magician would then "whew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, etc."{{sfn|Scot|1584|p=283}} He realized that the preparation might be beyond the capabilities of many would-be magicians, and directs his readers to "buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of W. Brome in Powles churchyard", the earliest known example of a magic prop for sale. William Broome of St. Paul's in London was active between 1577 and 1591.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} A similar description of the blow book was published in French the same year by Jean Prévost.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=10}}

The blow book is mentioned in ''[[Hocus Pocus Junior]]'', the earliest known collection of magic tricks in the [[English language]], published in London in 1635. In this text the concept is called a "iugling booke" ("juggling book") or "booke for Waggery". It contains a complete description of how to prepare a blow book. The author suggests presenting the book by saying "this booke is not painted thus as some of you may suppose, but it is of such a property, that whosoever bloweth on it, it wil give the representation of whatsoever he is naturally addicted unto". He further mentions that in order for the trick to work, one must use a "bold and audacious countenance, for that must be the grace of all your trickes". Many of the tricks in the book feature the magician or an audience member blowing on the prop; this was a common fixture of the trade.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}} The trick continues to appear in many books on magic through time, often with references to where to buy copies; in ''The Whole Art of Legerdemain'' of 1748 it's mentioned that "the blowing Books ... may have them at my Shop on little Tower-hill".{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}

None of these very early examples of blow books are known to exist today. The earliest surviving examples are a Belgian version from the 16th century,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=15}} and French and Italian books from the second half of the 18th century.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} By the 19th century prices on printed materials had dropped so much that the trick was quite well known, and it was not uncommon for magicians of the period to hand them out after their performances.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=12}} [[Quaker Oats]] even gave out a version in their cereal.&lt;ref&gt;The Print Collector's Newsletter, 1995, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept has never gone out of print for long, and modern examples remain widespread today, along with descriptions on how to make your own. Modern versions are typically in the form of children's [[coloring book]]s and remain popular, even appearing on [[The Wiggles]].{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220-223}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwCdRbJEJmU The Wiggles - Magic: Coloring Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical resemblance of the blow book to the early animation concept known as a [[flip book]] has been a subject of some consideration in animation circles. Whether the blow book inspired the flip book remains an unanswered question.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}}

==Description==
The most basic version of the blow book is based on alternating pages being different widths. The book is assembled by alternating the different pages, wide, narrow, wide, narrow (etc.), and then binding them together. Images of one type, black and white for instance, are drawn on every set of facing pages with narrow on the left and wide on the right. The alternate set of images, color in this example, are drawn on the alternate sets of pages with the wide page on the left and narrow on the right. The result is a series of alternating images on sets of facing pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

To perform the trick, the book is held by the binding in one hand and riffled with the other; for [[right handed]] magicians this will normally mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is riffled two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220&amp;ndash;223}}

More complex versions of the same basic concept can be used to have multiple sets of pages with different images. In these cases the pages are wider or narrower in a pattern along the entire length of the outer edge, creating a number of "hot spots" where the book can be riffled to cause different pages to appear. ''Hocus Pocus'' creates a similar concept by using small pieces of paper pasted to the pages to create the same effect, allowing the magician to grasp the tabs while they riffle. This version allows any number of pages per flip, the ''Pocus'' version using sets of eight pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Casting television''' is a competition [[television program]] where the winner wins a recording contract, or takes part in a competition.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

'''Central Park of Culture and Leisure named after Shcherbakov''' is a [[park|recreation park]] in [[Donetsk]]. It is located in [[Voroshylovskyi Raion]], in the west it matches with [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]], and in the north there is the Second city [[pond]].

Park was open in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldonetsk.info/en/central-recreation-park-shcherbakova-donetsk|title=The central recreation park of A.S. ShCherbakova in Donetsk - Donetsk: Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[rides]], [[playgrounds]], alleys for hiking and other recreational facilities available for visitors.
The park is named after [[Alexander Shcherbakov|Alexander Sergeevich Shcherbakov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrainehotelsonline.com/en/travel-Parks-Donetsk-Shcherbakova-Park/Shcherbakova-Park-Donetsk.html|title=Shcherbakova Park in Donetsk, photo and description Shcherbakova Park attraction of Donetsk, excursions to Shcherbakova Park, entertainment in Donetsk, Shcherbakova Park - the main attraction of Donetsk|first=Ukraine Hotels|last=Online|website=www.ukrainehotelsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the Secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee in 1938. However, the original name was different – at first the park was named after [[Pavel Postyshev|Pavel Petrovich Postyshev]], but the park was renamed after the last had been arrested.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/139|title=Парк им. Щербакова в Донецке - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the park==
The park is located in Skoromoshnaya [[gully]], which was the meeting place for workers of [[Yuzovsky metallurgical plant]] and the nearby [[coal mines]] in the 19th century. A [[travelling circus]] stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a  park, and in September 1932  10 000 [[Komsomol]] members and the city [[pioneer movement|pioneers]] started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.
In 1933 the alleys were established lined with [[chestnut tree]]s, [[lime tree]]s and [[Populus|poplar]]s. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. [[Amusement rides]] started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park "Medium Ponds", landscape park "Urban forest" and the "Upper" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the [[parterre]], which is the basis of the composition. The [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]] is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which [[pavilions]] were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of [[columns]] with [[cornices]]; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of [[tree]] and [[Shrub|shrub species]], and the 1955 edition "Donbass Parks" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk [[journalists]] established "Alley of Journalists". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, "Donetskproekt" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and [[rosary]] with variety of roses was made.

==Sculptures==
The sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of [[Joseph Stalin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/167|title=Парк культуры имени отдыха (товарища Щербакова) - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands.  In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball.  Stadium "Shakhtar" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/stalino/142|title=Архитектура довоенного Сталино - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a [[jar]] was placed on the banking of the "First" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the "Good Angel of Peace" was established in the Park as international symbol of [[patronage]]. On the statue basis the names of famous [[krainians|Ukrainian]] [[Patrón|patrons]] are carved: [[Nickolay Tereshchenko]], [[Bogdan Khanenko]], [[Vasiliy Tarnovskiy]], [[Rinat Akhmetov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html Остров&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131552/http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/ukraina/2008/09/01/519234.html|title=В Донецке русские художники золотом написали имя Ахметова|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/daily/130808/51296/ В парке им.

==Fountains==
The fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a [[parapet]]. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331030957/http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Children's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The [[train]] consisted of two coupled together [[trams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzd-ussr.ru/towns/donezk/|title=Донецк. Детская железная дорога|website=www.dzd-ussr.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the [[World War II]] outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt.

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

== Style ==
Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

'''Coin magic''' is the manipulating of [[coin]]s to entertain audiences.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;

 | isbn = 0-89471-623-9}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2008-01-06--&gt;Money Magic, pp. 175-221.&lt;/ref&gt; Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered [[close-up magic]] or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as [[card magic]], as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.

==Elements==
Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. [[handkerchief]]s, [[glasses]]) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of [[sleight of hand]] and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.

==Sleights and tricks==
{{Confusing|date=June 2010}}
&lt;!-- This section may need a more detailed description for each act. Comment from User:Davtra --&gt;

Some classic coin magic effects:
*Coin vanish - making a coin seemingly vanish.
*Coin production - making a coin seemingly appear.
*Transposition - making two coins switch places

Some classic coin magic plots:
*[[Miser's Dream]] - Grabbing multiple coins from thin air. Popularized by T. Nelson Downs, who would drop coin after coin into a borrowed top hat.
*Coins Across - The magical transfer of multiple coins from one hand to another.
*Three fly - A coins across type effect involving three coins ''visually'' transferring from one hand to another.
*Matrix - Impossibly moving four coins under the cover of playing cards.
*Chink-a-chink - A bare-handed Matrix.
*[[Coins Through Table]] - Coins penetrate through the surface of the table.
*Coin Bite - Taking a bite out of a coin then visually restoring it right in front of the spectator.
*Spellbound - Visually changing one coin into another, while only showing one coin at all times.
*Coins to Glass - Similar to coins across - coins transfer from one hand to a glass.
*Tenkai Pennies - A two coin routine where one coin travels from one hand to the other.
*Coin to bottle - A coin is slammed into a sealed bottle.

A sampling of coin sleights and moves:
*[[Palming]] - A form of concealment.
*[[Sleeving]] - A form of concealment.
*Lapping - A form of ditching a coin.
*[[The French Drop]] - a retention of vision coin vanish involving the Passing of a coin from one hand to the other than making it disappear.
*The Muscle Pass - Shooting a coin from one hand to the other, this can be done in such a way that can make the coin look as if it’s defying gravity

==Coin magicians==
Some magicians widely known for coin magic include:
* [[Thomas Nelson Downs]] (considered, along with J.B. Bobo, one of the magicians key to the development and teaching of modern coin magic)
* [[J.B. Bobo]] (author of Modern Coin Magic, a core reference and starting point for coin magicians)
* [[Tony Slydini]] (a well-known magician whose style of magic transformed close-up magic including his impressive coin routines)
* [[Dai Vernon]]
* [[Ed Marlo]]
* [[David Roth]] (most important developer of coin magic in the twentieth century and inventor of the standard plots common in current coin magic)
* [[Larry Jennings]]
* [[Michael Ammar]] (one of the most prolific publishers and teachers, an experienced all around magician, including coin work)
* [[Dean Dill]] (coin magician and inventor who has appeared on television and also works as a barber)
* [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]]
* [[Shoot Ogawa]] (Last Vegas restaurant performer known for highly stylized, high-difficulty, impressive coin magic)
* [[Apollo Robbins]] (contemporary of Shoot Ogawa and co-contributor to a number coin teaching materials)
* [[David Stone (magician)|David Stone]] (talented performer and teacher of fast-paced, flashy coin magic)
* [[Rocco Silano]]
* [[Jay Sankey]]
* [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]] (author of Chip Tricks, a magician and mentalist who has authored various magic instructional videos)
* [[Luis Piedrahita]]
* [[Michael Rubinstein]]
* [[Mike Gallo]]
* [[Chris Kenner]]
* [[Paul Cummins]]

==Performance==
Although some coin magic use [[gimmick]]s (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.

==In literature==
Canadian novelist [[Robertson Davies]] devotes a good part of his ''[[The Deptford Trilogy|Deptford Trilogy]]'' to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, [[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]], details his life and career.

In the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[American Gods]]'', the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.

In the [[Dean Koontz]] novel ''[[From the Corner of His Eye]]'', a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.

[[Stock character|Thieves, wizards, and jesters]], in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. [[Coin walk|Rolling a coin across the knuckles]] (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[Belgariad]]'', and [[Mat Cauthon]] and [[Thom Merrilin]] in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[Wheel of Time]]'' do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of [[Pirates of the Caribbean]]. Also, [[Vila Restal]] in the [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Blake's 7]]'' mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

The '''comedy of manners''' is a form of [[comedy]] that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through [[stock characters]] such as the ''[[miles gloriosus]]'' ("boastful soldier") in [[ancient Greek comedy]] or the [[fop]] and [[rake (character)|rake]] of English [[Restoration comedy]], which is sometimes used as a synonym for "comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), which satirized the [[Victorian morality]] of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.

The comedy of manners was first developed in the [[New Comedy]] period of [[ancient Greek comedy]] and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright [[Menander]]. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|ancient Roman playwrights]], such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the [[Renaissance]]. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright [[Molière]], who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' in plays such as ''[[L'École des femmes]]'' ([''The School for Wives''], 1662), ''[[Tartuffe]]'' ([''The Imposter''], 1664), and ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' ([''The Misanthrope''], 1666).

== Early examples ==
The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. [[Horace]]'s [[Satires (Horace)|Satire 1.9]] is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' might be considered the first comedy of manners In [[England]], but the genre really flourished during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. [[Restoration comedy]], which was influenced by [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[comedy of humours]], made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time.  The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of [[William Wycherley]] (''[[The Country Wife]]'', 1675) and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] (''[[The Way of the World]]'', 1700). In the late 18th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', 1773) and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (''[[The Rivals]]'', 1775; ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', 1777) revived the form.

The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists [[Noël Coward]] (''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', 1925) and [[Somerset Maugham]] and the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], as well as various [[British sitcom]]s.  The ''[[Carry On film]]s'' are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners 
style.

== Twentieth-century examples ==

The term ''[[comedy of menace]]'', which British drama critic [[Irving Wardle]] based on the subtitle of ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'' (1958), by [[David Campton]], is a jocular play-on-words derived from the "comedy of manners" (''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent).&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Susan Hollis Merritt, ''Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter'' (Durham &amp; London, 1990: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinter's play ''[[The Homecoming]]'' has been described as a mid-twentieth-century "comedy of manners".&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' (1999), [[David Mamet]] chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme).  Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class.  Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.

Other contemporary examples include [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Room with a View]]'', [[Barbara Pym]]'s ''[[Excellent Women]]'', [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s ''[[As Bees in Honey Drown]]'', ''[[The Country Club (play)|The Country Club]]'', ''[[The Little Dog Laughed (play)|The Little Dog Laughed]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'' by [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and [[Jimmy Perry]], and the [[Jeeves|Jeeves and Wooster]] series by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. The television program ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17294">'''Comic book therapy''' is a form of [[art therapy]] in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific [[comic book]]s, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses.

Both forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.

Comic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMullin|first=Juliet|date=2016-06-01|title=Cancer and the Comics: Graphic Narratives and Biolegitimate Lives|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maq.12172/abstract|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=149–167|doi=10.1111/maq.12172|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warson|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-04-01|title=Healing Pathways: Art Therapy for American Indian Cancer Survivors|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|journal=Journal of Cancer Education|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|issn=0885-8195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czerwiec|first=M.

== Comic Book Therapy and Graphic Medicine ==
{{main|Graphic medicine}}

Graphic medicine, originally coined by [http://myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams], is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It owes its success in part to the rise of [[medical humanities]], an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as "graphic pathologies", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.

Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.

The general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.

== History ==
The foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/history-of-comics/|title=The History of Comics: Decade by decade {{!}} The Artifice|website=the-artifice.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of ''The Funnies #1'' that the first collection of comics material came about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]], [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]], [[Peanuts]],'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]].''

Professionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicmedicine.org/a-short-history-of-art-comics/|title=A Short History of "Art" Comics {{!}} Graphic Medicine|last=Williams|first=Ian|date=|work=Graphic Medicine|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics #1'']], the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=M|date=2017|title=Graphic Novels: A Brief History, Their Use in Business Education, and the Potential for Negotiation Pedagogy|url=|journal=Negotiation and Conflict Management Research|volume=10|pages=324–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Current Uses in Today's Medical Setting ==
Since its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=M.J|date=1971|title=The use of graphic images in psychotherapy|url=|journal=American Journal of Art Therapy|volume=10|pages=153–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=E|date=1997|title=The symbolic graphic life-line: Integrating the past and present through graphic imagery|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=14|pages=261–267|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=A.J.|date=2017|title=Using comics to communicate about health: An introduction to the symposium on visual narratives and graphic medicine|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=32|pages=523–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jawad|first=Muna|date=2015-12-01|title=Comics are Research: Graphic Narratives as a New Way of Seeing Clinical Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=369–374|doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.

=== Therapeutic Tool ===

==== Creating a comic book ====
One form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=M.J.|date=2004|title=Comics as Art Therapy|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=21|pages=42–43|doi=10.1080/07421656.2004.10129317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"/&gt; Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, M.J. &amp; Myers, K.R.|first=|date=|title=Graphic medicine: use of comics in medical education and patient care.|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|pages=574–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reading a comic book ====
Another form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[eating disorder]]s, and so on. Popular novels include ''Cancervixen: a True Story'' by [[Marisa Acocella Marchetto]], ''Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me'' by [[Sarah Leavitt]], and ''Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me'' by [[Ellen Forney]]. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described  within the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karno|first=M.|last2=Brunon|first2=J|last3=Arch|first3=M|last4=Waldron|first4=P|date=1977|title=Therapeutic use of generative graphics|url=|journal=Art Psychotherapy|volume=4|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.

=== Educational Tool ===
Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmond|first=S.W.|last2=Echevarria|first2=M|date=|title=Healthcare Transformation and Changing Roles for Nursing|journal=Orthopedic Nursing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=12–25|doi=10.1097/NOR.0000000000000308|issn=0744-6020|pmc=5266427|pmid=28107295}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu/medical-education/md-program|title=M.D. Program {{!}} Medical Education|website=medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael J.|last2=Myers|first2=Kimberly|last3=Watson|first3=Katie|last4=Czerwiec|first4=M. K.|last5=Shapiro|first5=Dan|last6=Draus|first6=Stephanie|date=2016-12-01|title=Creativity in Medical Education: The Value of Having Medical Students Make Stuff|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=475–483|doi=10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8588">'''Comics poetry''' is a hybrid creative form that combines aspects of [[comics]] and [[poetry]]. It draws from the [[syntax]] of comics, [[image|images]], [[Panel (comics)|panels]], [[Speech balloon|speech balloons]], and so on, in order to produce a literary or artistic experience akin to that of traditional poetry.

== History ==

Comics poetry traces its origins to [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, [[concrete poetry]], and poets who combined images and text such as [[Kenneth Patchen]]. In the mid-2000s, a number of artist-poets began publishing independently of one another, referring to what they were doing expressly as comics poetry. According to artist and scholar Tamryn Bennett, "The term comics poetry can be applied to a growing field of works that fall outside of traditional definitions of both comics and poetry. These works include Warren Craghead’s ''How To Be Everywhere'' (2007); [[Matt Madden]]’s ''Comic Sestina'' (2004), [[Michael Farrell (poet)|Michael Farrell]]’s ''BREAK ME OUCH'' (2006); as well as a host of comics poetry collections by [[Bianca Stone]], Alexander Rothman, Paul K. Tunis, Gary Sullivan, John Hankiewicz, [[Anders Nilsen (cartoonist)|Anders Nilsen]], Derik Badman, Eroyn Franklin, [[Franklin Einspruch]], Sommer Browning, Kimball Anderson, Mohit Trendster, Kevin Czapiewski, Malcy Duff and [[Julie Delporte]], among others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Tamryn|title=Comics Poetry: The Art of the Possible|url=https://cordite.org.au/scholarly/comics-poetry/|website=Cordite Poetry Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

Use of the terms "comics poetry" and "poetry comics" is widespread among its practitioners. Alexander Rothman, editor-in-chief of ''Ink Brick'', has written, "I call the work that I make and publish 'comics poetry.' ...at the end of the day, more than any other practitioner, a poet is just dealing with words.... Words aren’t necessary for comics, but of course they’re there to use. Panels aren’t necessary, but they’re also there to use. Where the poet’s toolbox contains every imaginable arrangement or manipulation of words, the cartoonist’s holds analogs for the visual elements of the page."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Alexander|title=What Is Comics Poetry?|url=https://indianareview.org/2015/06/what-is-comics-poetry-by-alexander-rothman/|website=Indiana Review|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrissy Williams, editor of ''Over the Line: An Introduction to Poetry Comics'', said in an interview, "I generally say 'poetry comic' by the way, not to give any priority to the poetry, but rather to avoid any confusion with 'comic poems,' which are already their own very different hilarious genre of poem. ... the genre needs to be defined fundamentally as an inextricable combination of both comics and poetry, neither of which should be dispensable. In the best poetry comics, I believe, the piece would fail utterly (or at best be horrifically diminished) if you removed either the poetry or the artwork from the composition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elkin|first1=Daniel|title=Parsing Poetry Comics — An Interview with Chrissy Williams|url=http://comicsbulletin.com/parsing-poetry-comics-interview-chrissy-williams/|website=Comics Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamryn Bennet has written, "Like [comics poet] Derik Badman, I use the term ‘comics poetry’, as opposed to ‘graphic poetry’, ‘comics-as-poetry’, or ‘poetry comics’, as it refers to the origins of the form rather than the sequential narratives of graphic novels. As Badman explains, ‘Comics poetry isn’t poetry as text with comics images; it’s the whole comic as poetry. The images, the words, the structure, the rhythm, the page, all of it is used together to create the poetry, to create comics in a poetic register."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Tamryn|title=Comics Poetry: The Art of the Possible|url=https://cordite.org.au/scholarly/comics-poetry/|website=Cordite Poetry Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comics poetry" can be used to differentiate the genre from written poems later interpreted in comics form, such as the work of [[Dave Morice#Poetry Comics|Dave Morice]], which is also called "poetry comics."

'''Cup-and-ball''' (or '''ball in a cup''') or '''ring and pin''' is a traditional children's toy. It is generally a wooden handle, to which a small ball is attached by a string, and which has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including '''boliche''' in Spain and '''balero''' in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the '''bilboquet'''. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called ''[[kendama]]'' is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity.

==History==

The game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then.
===Americas===

[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 067.JPG|thumbnail|Baleros at a [[tianguis]] in [[Uruapan]], [[Michoacan]], Mexico]]
[[File:Balero Demonstration showing a common method of landing the cup on the stick.webm|thumb|Balero demonstration in Mexico showing a common technique of landing the cup on the stick.]]

In North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Mohave people|Mohave]] variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Other variants include those played by the [[Inuit]] of what is now [[Labrador]], with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Ring and pin games in general were known as ''ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk'' in [[Inuit languages|Inuit dialects]].&lt;ref name="Blanchard1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendall Blanchard|title=The Anthropology of Sport: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGeLoS1pWA4C&amp;pg=PA148|date=1 January 1995|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-89789-330-5|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Bole Jeanne L Enfant Au Bilboquet.jpg|thumb|Jeanne Bôle's ''L'Enfant au Bilboquet'' (around 1880)]]

The cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Leibs&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports and Games of the Renaissance|author=Andrew Leibs|pages=84,147–148|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=0-313-32772-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played by King [[Henry III of France]] as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability.&lt;ref name="Freer1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Walker Freer|title=Henry III, King of France and Poland: His Court and Times. From Numerous Unpublished Sources, Including Ms. Documents in the Bibliotheque Impériale, and the Archives of France and Italy, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjTAAAAMAAJ|year=1888|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=10}} - ''"it is lamentable to read of the pitiful imbecility which could induce the king, the day following his indignant protest, to sally forth from the Louvre at the head of a disorderly troop, and to parade the streets of the capital playing with a cup-and-ball.''&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} such as the Marquis de Biévre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Strand Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67UvAAAAMAAJ|year=1907|publisher=G. Newnes|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had its golden age during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] — among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] mentions the game early in his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying "If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=The Confessions of J.

===Iberian world===

The game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora, often known as '''boliche'''. The name varies across many countries — in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] it is called '''capirucho'''; in [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Mexico]] it is called '''balero'''; in [[Spain]] it is '''boliche'''; in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] it is called '''bilboquê'''; in [[Chile]] it is '''emboque'''; in [[Colombia]] it is called '''coca'''; and in [[Venezuela]] the game is called '''perinola'''.&lt;ref name="CIVILA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Civila|title=El balero|publisher=Open Publishing|language=Spanish|url=http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|accessdate=3 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914195227/http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|archivedate=14 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term ''zingo paya'' for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zingopaya.com/|title=The Zingo Paya Society|author=|date=|work=zingopaya.com|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline|date=February 2016}}

===England===

This game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as [[Jane Austen]] is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called ''Bilbo Catcher''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

There is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw40080/Charlotte-Mercier-Miss-playing-with-Cup-and-Ball|title=NPG D5676; Charlotte Mercier ('Miss playing with Cup and Ball') - Portrait - National Portrait Gallery|author=|date=|work=npg.org.uk|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other.

===Japan===

The game of [[kendama]] is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century.

===Germany===

In 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their [[Yo-yo|Yo-yos]] and [[Kendama|Kendamas]], began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy.

==Gameplay==

The main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging.

There are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as ''la simple'', ''la doble'', ''la vertical'', ''la mariquita''.

The '''''Cypria''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Κύπρια}} ''Kúpria''; [[Latin]]: ''Cypria'') is a lost [[epic poetry|epic poem]] of ancient [[Greek literature]], which has been attributed to [[Stasinus]] and was quite well known in [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] (ii.117) refers to it.&lt;/ref&gt; and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the [[Epic Cycle]], which told the entire history of the [[Trojan War]] in epic hexameter verse. The story of the ''Cypria'' comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the ''[[Iliad]]''; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic [[dactylic hexameter]]s.

==Date and authorship==
The ''Cypria'', in the written form in which it was known in [[classical Greece]], was probably composed in the late seventh century BC,&lt;ref&gt;"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgement of Paris]] on the Chigi vase" (Burkert 1992:103). On the [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Orientalizing style|proto-Attic]] [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]] of ca. 640 BC called the [http://www.wisc.edu/arth/ah300/13-myth/33.image.html Chigi "vase"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Paris is identified as ''Al[exand]ros'', as he was apparently called in ''Cypria''.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted&lt;ref&gt;In his Preface to ''Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica''&lt;/ref&gt; "were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by [[Homer]]," one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of ''Cypria'' as post-Homeric, in effect a "[[prequel]]". "The author of the ''Kypria'' already regarded the ''Iliad'' as a text. Any reading of the ''Kypria'' will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the ''Iliad'' in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lykaon]] to [[Lemnos]] or the kitting out of [[Achilles]] with [[Briseis]] and [[Agamemnon]] with [[Chryseis]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Dowden]], "Homer's Sense of Text" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''116''' (1996, pp. 47-61). p 48, noting that the observation had been made by Eric Bethe, in ''Homer: Dichtung und Sage II: Odysee, Kyklos, Zeitbestimmung'', 1922:202.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison can be made with the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the ''Iliad'' as text.

The stories contained in the ''Cypria'', on the other hand, were fixed&lt;ref&gt;W. Kullmann's term ''Faktkanon'', the "canon of facts" is useful in distinguishing fixed narrative content— the list and sequence of facts— from fixed, [[Canon (fiction)|canonic texts]].&lt;/ref&gt; much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating [[oral tradition]]s associated with the [[Homer]]ic epics also apply to the ''Cypria''. Many or all of the stories in the ''Cypria'' were known to the composer(s) of the ''Iliad'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The ''Cypria'', in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the ''Iliad''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911: "[[Stasinus]]"&lt;/ref&gt; though there is an overlap in events from the death of [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]], including the catalogue of Trojan allies.{{sfn|Pinder|1995}} J. Marks observes that "Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the ''Kypria'' simply ended with the death of Palamedes."{{sfn|Pinder|1995|p=2}}

The title ''Cypria'', associating the epic with [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, (Burkert 1992:103) noting Mesopotamian parallels, concludes "these observations must then point to that epoch when Cyprus, though rich and powerful, was still formally under Assyrian domination".&lt;/ref&gt; demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition&lt;ref&gt;Recorded in [[John Tzetzes]]' ''Chiliades'' xiii.638.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been given by [[Homer]] as a dowry to his son-in-law, a [[Stasinus of Cyprus]] mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by [[Pindar]]. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the ''Cypria'' was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see [[Cyclic Poets]]).

It is possible that the "[[Trojan Battle Order]]" (the list of [[Troy|Trojans]] and their allies, of ''[[Iliad]]'' 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'') is abridged from that in the ''Cypria'', which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.

==Manuscript tradition==
In current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the ''Cypria'''s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the ''[[Chrestomathy]]'' attributed to an unknown "Proclus" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian [[Eutychius Proclus]], or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Chrestomathy'' itself was preserved in the ninth-century Patriarch [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]]' renowned ''Bibliotheca'' or ''Myriobiblon'', codex 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.

==Content==
What follows embeds reports of known content of the ''Cypria'' in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.

The poem narrates the origins of the [[Trojan War]] and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992: 101-04. Compare ''[[Atra-Hasis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seven Against Thebes|Theban war of the Seven]] ensues.

The ''Cypria'' described the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]; in the [[Judgement of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Paris is called ''Alexandros'' in quotations of ''Cypria'' and in the surviving synopsis.&lt;/ref&gt; among the goddesses [[Athena]], [[Hera]], and [[Aphrodite]]: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]].

Then Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and [[Helenus]] foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders [[Aeneas]] to sail with him, while [[Cassandra]] prophesies the outcome. In [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] the Trojans are entertained by the sons of [[Tyndareus]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]], and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen&lt;ref&gt;"In the Cypria, Nemesis was Helen's mother, born after Zeus raped the goddess, who had done her best to escape him." {{cite journal|last1=Scodel|first1=Ruth|title=Stupid, Pointless Wars|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|date=2008|volume=138|pages=219–235|doi=10.1353/apa.0.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her [[dowry]] back to his home of [[Troy]] with an episode at [[Sidon]], which Paris and his men successfully storm.

In the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of [[Idas]] and [[Lynceus]], are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.

[[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother [[Agamemnon]]. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] in a digression tells Menelaus how [[Epopeus]] was destroyed after seducing the daughter of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], the story of [[Oedipus]], the madness of [[Heracles]], and the story of [[Theseus]] and [[Ariadne]]. In gathering the leaders, they detect [[Odysseus]]' feigned madness.

The assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], where the prophet [[Calchas]] warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of [[Teuthras]] in [[Mysia]] and sack it in error for Ilium: [[Telephus]] comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by [[Achilles]]. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at [[Skyros]] and marries [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidameia]], the daughter of [[Lycomedes]], then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.

When the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to appease the goddess [[Artemis]] and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.
Artemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the [[Tauri]], making her immortal.

Next they sail as far as [[Tenedos]], where while they are feasting, [[Philoctetes]] is bitten by a snake and is left behind in [[Lemnos]]. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the [[Troad]] is repulsed by the Trojans, and [[Protesilaus]] is killed by [[Hector]]. Achilles then kills [[Cycnus]], the son of [[Poseidon]], and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.

Achilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and [[Thetis]] contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by
Achilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills [[Troilus]]. [[Patroclus]] carries away [[Lycaon (Troy)|Lycaon]] to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives [[Briseis]] as a prize, and Agamemnon [[Chryseis]].
Then follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.

==Reception==
The ''Cypria'' was considered to be a lesser work than [[Homer]]'s two masterpieces: [[Aristotle]] criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.

The '''Entertainments National Service Association''' ('''ENSA''') was an organisation set up in 1939 by [[Basil Dean]] and [[Leslie Henson]] to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during [[World War II]]. ENSA operated as part of the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]]. It was superseded by [[Combined Services Entertainment]] (CSE) which now operates as part of the [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation]] (SSVC).

The first big wartime variety concert organised by ENSA was broadcast by the [[BBC]] to the Empire and local networks from RAF Hendon in north London on 17 October 1939. [[Adelaide Hall]], [[The Western Brothers]] and [[Mantovani]] were amongst those entertainers appearing on the bill. A [[Newsreel]] of this concert showing [[Adelaide Hall]] singing ''[[We're Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line]]'' accompanied by Mantovani and His Orchestra exists.&lt;ref&gt;''Mantovani: A Lifetime in Music'' by Colin MacKenzie, page 78: {{ISBN|978-1905226191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Despite many extremely talented entertainers and movie stars working for ENSA, the organisation was necessarily spread thin over the vast area it had to cover. Thus many entertainments were substandard, and the popular translation of the acronym ENSA was ''"Every Night Something Awful"''.

ENSA plays a modest role in the 1944 motion picture [[Love Story (1944 film)|Love Story]] in which [[Margaret Lockwood]] stars as a concert pianist who makes an ENSA tour to North Africa and the Mediterranean region.

The 1959 film ''[[Desert Mice]]'' follows the fictional escapades of an ENSA troop starring Sid James assigned to the Africa core.

''Chaos Supersedes ENSA'', a mini-series (1980), was written and directed by [[Patrick Garland]] for [[Thames Television]].

The television sitcom ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' concerned the misadventures of a group of soldiers providing entertainment for an army barracks in [[India]].  These were known as the ''[[Concert Party (entertainment)|Concert Party]]'' and were not ENSA members at all as they were all members of the Royal Artillery and were members of the Army (in fact in the early episodes, they were all in danger of being sent to the front by the Sergeant Major ([[Windsor Davies]].)

ENSA also featured in the television sitcom ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', in the episode "How I Won the War".

The only known ENSA theatre to have survived in its original condition is the Garrison Theatre at [[Hurst Castle]] in the [[New Forest#New Forest National Park|New Forest National Park]]. Created by servicemen in 1939, the proscenium arch still bears the badge and grenades of the [[Royal Artillery]], and the curtains still hang from an original galvanised gas pipe. Shows are presented from time to time by the Friends of Hurst Castle.

In the ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' episode entitled "Camping In", Mr. Grainger told a story of being a member of ENSA which Mr. Humphries said stood for "Every Night Something awful 'Appens".

In the popular [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode "[[Museum Piece]]", ENSA is revealed to be using the rifles [[Captain Mainwaring]] so desperately seeks.

In the [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Up Pompeii]]'' episode "[[Lysistrata the Peace Treaty]]", The main character Lurcio ([[Frankie Howerd]]) is conscripted into the army. He is told by Captain Bumptius that he will be assigned to "ENSA". Lurcio responds that it is not that bad and starts going over show ideas. Captain Bumptius then tells him it stands for the "East Naples Suicide Army"!

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

An '''innuendo''' is a [[wikt:hint|hint]], [[wikt:insinuation|insinuation]] or [[wikt:intimation|intimation]] about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging  (also called '''insinuation'''), that works obliquely by [[allusion]]. In the latter sense the intention is often to [[insult]] or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.

According to the ''[[Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary]]'', an innuendo is "an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude", such as:'' "innuendos about her private life" ''or'' "The song is full of sexual innuendo".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094326/http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo |date=2015-05-18 }} (7th Edition; electronic version)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''sexual innuendo''' has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" [[double entendre]] by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: "We need to go deeper" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an [[intimate part]].

In the context of [[Defamation|defamation law]], an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.

==Film, television and other media==
Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. [[British sitcoms]] and comedy shows such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC News|date=February 1, 1999|quote=The innuendo was loud and clear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227013009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Round the Horne]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|title=A return to unalloyed joy|author=Dominic Cavendish|date=31 Oct 2003|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|quote=...a censor-baiting mixture of absurd spoofs, yarns, links and character-turns, laced with end-of-the-pier innuendo and erudite-infantile wordplay.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924212749/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|title=Only The Brits: Not Christmas Without Pantomime|publisher=NPR|date=December 25, 2011|quote=No panto is complete without a dose of smutty innuendo for the adults and some contemporary political jokes.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101101932/http://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animal Flyer.jpg|thumb|A male cat paying a "call" on a female cat, who then serves up kittens, insinuating that the "result" of children is predicated on a male "catcall"]]

Numerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.

Many American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue.{{fact|date=January 2012}} Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

On ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stop Defacing Signs.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[stop sign]] ironically defaced with a plea ''not'' to deface stop signs.]]

'''Irony''' ({{ety|grc|''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía|dissimulation, feigned ignorance}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', v. sub {{lang|grc|εἰρωνεία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in its broadest sense, is a [[rhetorical device]], [[literary technique]], or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 

Irony can be categorized into different types, including: ''verbal irony'', ''dramatic irony'', and ''situational irony''. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of [[simile]], used in [[sarcasm]], and some forms of [[litotes]] can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, as identified by historian [[Connop Thirlwall]], include dialectic and practical irony.&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Henry Watson Fowler]], in ''[[The King's English]]'', says, "any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same." Also, Eric Partridge, in ''[[Eric Partridge|Usage and Abusage]]'', writes that "Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant."

The use of irony may require the concept of a ''double audience''. Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear &amp; shall not understand, &amp; another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more &amp; of the outsiders' incomprehension.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"&gt;Fowler, H. W., ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'', 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''incongruous'' and applied to "every trivial oddity" in situations where there is no double audience.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"/&gt; An example of such usage is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gassner, J., Quinn, E., ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''{{'s}} secondary meaning for ''irony'': "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |title="irony" at dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218045412/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. {{Anchor|Incongruity_plus_human_folly}} It is often included in definitions of irony ''not only'' that incongruity is present ''but also'' that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ''ironic'' to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that "suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Free Dictionary'' under ''ironic'': http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic&lt;/ref&gt;

On this aspect, ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') has also:&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "irony" entry, second definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things. (In French, ''ironie du sort'').}}

==Origin of the term==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=irony |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |accessdate=18 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010710/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|1=The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character [[Eiron]], a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character [[Alazon]]. The Socratic irony of the [[Platonic dialogues]] derives from this comic origin.}}

According to Richard Whately:&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; "Rhetoric", ''Encyclopedia Metropolitan'', I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the ''OED'' entry)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[[Aristotle]] mentions ''Eironeia'', which in his time was commonly employed to signify, not according to the modern use of 'Irony, saying the contrary to what is meant', but, what later writers usually express by [[Litotes]], i.e. 'saying less than is meant'.}}

The word came into English as a [[figure of speech]] in the 16th century as similar to the French ''ironie''. It derives from the Latin ''ironia'' and ultimately from the Greek ''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía, meaning ''dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Situational irony - Baker Street tube station.jpg|thumb|A "No smoking" sign surrounded by images of a smoking [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[Baker Street tube station]]]]

''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' distinguishes between the following types of irony:&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Preminger, A. &amp; Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan,

*'''Cosmic''' irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, "general [irony] of the world."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;
*'''Verbal''' irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
*'''Situational''' irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect.
*'''Dramatic''' irony and '''tragic''' irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it.

===Verbal irony===
According to ''A glossary of literary terms'' by Abrams and Hartman,&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Verbal irony''' is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. H., &amp; Harpham, G. G., ''A glossary of literary terms'', 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced ''intentionally'' by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, "I'm not upset!" but reveals an upset [[emotional]] state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.

In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. "We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".
&lt;ref&gt;
Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 135. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic [[simile#irony|similes]] are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means ''A'' but that eventually conveys the meaning ''not A'':
* as soft as concrete
* as clear as mud
* as pleasant as a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]]
* "as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake" (Kurt Vonnegut from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'')

The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.

====Verbal irony and sarcasm====
A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and [[sarcasm]].

Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s entry for [[sarcasm]] does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:
{{Quote|1=A figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.}}

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' has "Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm"; while the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' entry is:
{{Quote|1=Sarcasm: 1&amp;thinsp;: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain. 2 a&amp;thinsp;: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual.}}

Partridge in ''[[Usage and Abusage]]'' would separate the two forms of speech completely: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The psychologist Martin, in ''The Psychology of Humour'', is quite clear that irony is where "the literal meaning is opposite to the intended" and sarcasm is "aggressive humor that pokes fun".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., ''The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach'', Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement "What a nice day" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites [[Winston Churchill]], who is supposed to have said, when told by [[Bessie Braddock]] that he was drunk, "But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.

Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you." The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.

Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term ''sarcasm'' is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant &amp; Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some [[psycholinguistic]] theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that [[sarcasm]] ("Great idea!", "I hear they do fine work."), [[hyperbole]] ("That's the best idea I have heard in years!"), [[understatement]] ("Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer..."), [[rhetorical question]]s ("What, does your spirit have cancer?"), [[double entendre]] ("I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and [[jocularity]] ("Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices ([[trope (literature)|tropes]]) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt &amp; Gibbs, 2000).

====Verbal irony and echoic allusion====
Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a [[speech act]] by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Deirdre. "The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?." Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic markers]] such as prosody, tone, or pitch,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. "Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech." Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.&lt;ref&gt;González-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. "Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony." Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:
* Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know.
* Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken.
From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of "I just must have been mistaken" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. [[Connop Thirlwall]] in his 1833 article ''On the Irony of [[Sophocles]]'' originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184251/http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, ''A Study of Sophoclean Drama'', p. 258: "The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, "On the Irony of Sophocles," by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirlwall's original article appears in ''Philological Museum'' (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines dramatic irony as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|1=the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

According to Stanton,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., "Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances", ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420–426, The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)
—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the ''contrary'' of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

For example:
* In ''[[City Lights]]'', the audience knows that [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.&lt;ref&gt;
Clausius, C., ''The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy'', P. Lang, 1989, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, P., ''Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach'', Continuum, 2004, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Othello]]'', the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, W. C., ''A Rhetoric of Irony'', University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Rhetoric_of_Irony.html?id=jbgufPEUD6QC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]], ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]'', The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22–23.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cask_of_Amontillado.html?id=4b6PnHfQ1y8C]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, A., ''Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels'', Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Parallel_Lives_of_Jesus.html?id=6qDZ3Aie08EC]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tragic irony====
Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines this as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

[[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[legend]]s that most of the plays dramatized. [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, Claire. ''Irony''. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|1=Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama.... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome.... In Sophocles' ''Oedipus the King'', for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.}}

Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 125. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Guide_to_Ancient_Greek_Drama.html?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''Romeo and Juliet'', when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.&lt;ref&gt;William, J., ''Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/CliffsComplete_Romeo_and_Juliet.html?id=c7MyAImulJ0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
Lars Elleström writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Situational irony'' ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Elleström, L., ''Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music and the Visual Arts'', Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example:
*When [[Reagan assassination attempt|John Hinckley attempted to assassinate]] [[Ronald Reagan]], all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W. Hinckley, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020803230701/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html |date=2002-08-03 }} by Doug Linder. 2001 Retrieved 9 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 138. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she'd had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for [[intelligence]], only to discover he is already a [[genius]], and the [[Tin Woodman]] longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of [[love]]. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering [[coward]], turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in [[Emerald City]] believed the Wizard to be a powerful [[deity]], only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*In [[O. Henry]]'s story "[[The Gift of the Magi]]", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts.  The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. "The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled." &lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; ''Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader'', Routledge, 2007, p. 59.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cosmic irony}}Cosmic irony (irony of fate)====
The expression cosmic irony or "irony of fate" stems from the notion that the gods (or the [[Moirai|Fates]]) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.

According to Sudhir Dixit, "Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile [[deus ex machina]] in Hardy's novels." In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' "there are several instances of this type of irony."&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, S., ''Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2001, p. 182.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hardys_Tess_Of_The_Durbervilles.html?id=n45KUGyNsYQC]&lt;/ref&gt; One example follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, Thomas]], ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', Oxford World's Classics, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.

====Historical irony====
When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s ''The New York Times'' repeatedly scorned [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]. In 1924, it lamented "the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern." In 1925 it said "the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast." Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|title=Puzzles|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011533/http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the "[[First World War]]" was  called by [[H. G. Wells]] "the war that will end war",&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]], ''The War That Will End War'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became "[[the war to end war]]" and "the war to end all wars", and this became a widespread truism, almost a [[cliché]]. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the [[Vietnam War]], where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the [[Viet Cong]] (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the [[Viet Minh]] in its fight against Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="Neale, Jonathan page 17"&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 17, {{ISBN|1-898876-67-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to ''The Irony of American History'', [[Andrew Bacevich]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Bacevich, A., in Niebuhr, R., ''The Irony of American History'', University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=After 9/11, the Bush administration announced its intention of bringing freedom and democracy to the people of the Middle East. Ideologues within the Bush administration persuaded themselves that American power, adroitly employed, could transform that region ... The results speak for themselves.}}

Gunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemists]] searching for an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]].&lt;ref name="Jack Kelly 2005"&gt;Jack Kelly ''Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World'', Perseus Books Group, 2005, {{ISBN|0465037224}}, 9780465037223: pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical irony also includes [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions|inventors killed by their own creations]], such as [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.

In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of [[divine providence]] to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.

Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:

*In the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1856, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbacher, D. E., ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'', Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90.

*In the [[Kalgoorlie]] (Australia) gold rush of the 1890s, large amounts of the little-known mineral [[calaverite]] (gold telluride) were ironically identified as [[fool's gold]].

When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Kean, S., ''The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements'', Random House, 2011, pp. 226–228.

==Use==

===Comic irony===
Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect.  This may also be combined with [[satire]].  For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.

Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' begins with the proposition "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. "Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial."&lt;ref&gt;Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; ''Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 77. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chick_Lit.html?id=lMjey3Bese0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''[[The Third Man]]'' is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; ''Ethics at the Cinema'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ethics_at_the_Cinema.html?id=QdP_xLImIugC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about performances of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: "Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R., in ''The Shakespearean  International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century'', Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Shakespearean_International_Yearbook.html?id=ZQ3LrE-Iy-kC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic irony and metafiction===
Romantic irony is "an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "romantic irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Dane writes "From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony." He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: "But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J. A., ''The Critical Mythology of Irony'', University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5 [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Critical_Mythology_of_Irony.html?id=6EAw-H8zvDkC]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as [[Don Quixote]] and [[Tristram Shandy]], Douglas Muecke points particularly to [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1964 play, ''[[Marat/Sade]]''. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, "The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the "audience" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, "in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press", while "in England ... [it] is almost unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. pp. 178–180]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a book entitled ''English Romantic Irony'', Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Anne K., ''English Romantic Irony'', Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_romantic_irony.html?id=M_C1AAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=Romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program. Ontologically, it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic. No order, no far goal of time, ordained by God or right reason, determines the progression of human or natural events.... Of course, romantic irony itself has more than one mode. The style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer.... But however distinctive the voice, a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming.}}

Similarly, [[metafiction]] is: "Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "metafiction" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.

Gesa Giesing writes that "the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony." Giesing notes that "There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;Giesing, G., ''Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark'', GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafictional_Aspects_in_Novels_by_Murie.html?id=4gRwgvoY_ysC]&lt;/ref&gt;

For examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed "What is metafiction?". These include:

"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best" - ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''

"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ..." - ''The death of the novel and other stories'' by [[Ronald Sukenick]]&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, P., ''Metafiction: The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction'', Routledge, 2002, p. 1.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafiction.html?id=O2MkrWv6RIUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'' refers to [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, B., ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108–109.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Postmodern.html?id=PoKi_TnntzcC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socratic irony===&lt;!--'Socratic irony' redirects here--&gt;
{{Main article|Socratic method}}
'''Socratic irony'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is "the dissimulation of ignorance practised by [[Socrates]] as a means of confuting an adversary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. ''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' defines it as "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more".

Zoe Williams of ''The Guardian'' wrote: "The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots."&lt;ref name="Guardian Online: The Final Irony"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Online: The Final Irony |publisher=Guardian |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=12 December 2010 |location=London |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230808/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, ''[[Columbo]]''.  The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent.  His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion.  As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating.  With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G. ''How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony as infinite, absolute negativity===
Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S, ''The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates'' (1841), Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is taken from [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'', and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] ("On Incomprehensibility"), [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stendhal]], and the 20th century [[deconstruction]]ist [[Paul de Man]] ("The Concept of Irony"). In Kierkegaard's words, from [[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|title=Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Concept of Irony|author=|date=|website=sorenkierkegaard.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222139/http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple [[litotes]]—must, in Kierkegaard's words, "swallow its own stomach". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other [[postmodern]] tropes as the cause of "great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony and awkwardness===

The '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from "saying what one doesn't mean" into a "general stance of&amp;nbsp;detachment&amp;nbsp;from life in general",&lt;ref&gt;Kotsko, Adam, ''Awkwardness.'', O-Books, 2010, pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, ''[[Seinfeld]]'') relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.

The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, [[Millennials]], are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipsters]] are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|title=How to Live Without Irony|first=Christy|last=Wampole|date=17 November 2012|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325230612/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speakers of English complain that the words ''irony'' and ''ironic'' are often misused,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|title=Learning to love Alanis Morissette’s ‘irony’ - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|website=bostonglobe.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125191124/http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|title=irony - Origin and meaning of irony by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614210204/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|archivedate=14 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song [[Ironic (song)|"Isn't it Ironic?"]] cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, D., ''Senior Year: A Father, A Son, and High School Baseball'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92.

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tim Conley cites the following:
"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word "ironically", as it opens a sentence:
# By a tragic coincidence
# By an exceptional coincidence
# By a curious coincidence
# By a coincidence of no importance
# You and I know, of course, though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun
# Oddly enough, or it's a rum thing that
# Oh hell! I've run out of words to start a sentence with."&lt;ref&gt;Conley, T., ''Joyces Mistakes: Problems of Intention, Irony, and Interpretation'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 81.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punctuation==
{{main article|Irony punctuation}}
No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an [[Irony punctuation|irony punctuation mark]] was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or [[percontation point]], which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or [[sarcasm]]. French writer [[Hervé Bazin]] suggested another ''pointe d'ironie'': the Greek letter ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' {{lang|el|Ψ}} with a dot below it, while [[Tom Driberg]] recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Houston, K., ''Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks'', W.

Examples of [[misogyny]] exist in many published forms, within multiple cultures and well-observed works.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj. [http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/taj_hashmi/Popular_Islam_and_Misogyn1.pdf Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh]. Retrieved October 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advances in the modern era have contributed proficient means to media and marketing to the resultant [[mass media]] in the 21st century. The merging of '''misogyny and mass media''' has made numerous examples where studies have concluded correlations between misogynous messages, both obvious and [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]]. Corresponding physical appearance of violence and hateful conduct may be seen relative to exposure.&lt;ref name= "Dietz" /&gt;

==Music, violence, and aggression==


Messages containing [[misogynous]] views are found commonly in the media.&lt;ref name="Nagayama"&gt;Nagayama Hall, Gordon C.

Dietz states that the concept of [[masculinity]] has come to be associated with sexual aggression.&lt;ref name="Dietz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dietz | first1 = Tracy L | year = 1998 | title = An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior | doi = 10.1023/A:1018709905920 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 425–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that audiences of unpunished violent behavior, compared to audiences of punished violent behavior are more likely to take part in violence.&lt;ref name="Wester" /&gt; Some musical themes and [[lyrics]] can be compared to the negative attitude toward women found within some [[pornographic movies]] and magazines.&lt;ref name="Nagayama" /&gt; This negative attitude and acceptance of [[Violence against women|violence towards women]] shows the possible likelihood of rape or sexual coercion.&lt;ref name=" St.Lawrence"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = St | first1 =  | last2 = Lawrence | first2 = Janet S. | last3 = Joyner | first3 = Doris J. | year = 1991 | title = The Effects of Sexually Violent Rock Music on Males' Acceptance of Violence against Women | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00477.x | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 49–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer and Greitemeyer found that men who listened to sexually aggressive music reported that their relationship with women was more troublesome.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Peter | last2 = Greitemeyer | first2 = Tobias | year = 2006 | title = Music and Aggression: The Impact of Sexual-Aggressive Song Lyrics on Aggression-Related Thoughts, Emotions and Behavior Toward the Same and the Opposite Sex | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1165–175 | doi=10.1177/0146167206288670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media Violence research has found that aggressive music adds an accessibility of aggressive related attitudes and emotions.&lt;ref name="Fischer" /&gt; Roberta Hamilton in her book ''Does Misogyny Matter?'' (1987) stated,"Misogyny is not a word useful simply for describing particularly nasty bits of behavior, but rather it directs us to a set of relations, attitudes, and behaviors that are embedded within all social relations"(p.&amp;nbsp;123).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Roberta. Does Misogyny Matter?: Its Reproduction and Its Consequences for Social Progress. Kingston, Ont.: Programme of Studies in National and International Development, Queenś University, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;  Violence in the form of linguistics is in fact a form of physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gorsevski | first1 = Ellen W | year = 1998 | title = The Physical Side of Linguistic Violence | url = | journal = Peace Review | volume = 10 | issue = 4| page = 513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;

Rubin, West and Mitchell (2001) found that many studies have seen consumers of [[rap]] and [[heavy metal music]] as having more hostile attitudes, higher sexual activity and more drug use than consumers of other music.&lt;ref name= "Fischer" /&gt;

=== Gangsta rap ===
[[File:Eminem performing live at dj hero party.jpg|thumb|upright|Eminem performing live at the ''[[DJ Hero]]'' Party in Los Angeles]]
Themes of misogyny can be seen in much [[gangsta rap]] (GR) music. This music elevates degradations of women such as rape, torment, and violence. In a study conducted by Armstrong in 2001, he found after examining 490 GR songs, that 22 percent contained violent and misogynist lyrics.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = Edward G | year = 2001 | title = Gangsta Misogyny: A Content Analysis of the Portrayals of Violence Against Women in Rap Music, 1987–1993 | url = | journal = Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 96–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wester, Crown, Quatman, and Heesacker state that, "The increasing popularity of GR, coupled with documentation of society's increased [[sexism]],&lt;ref&gt;Faludi, 1991; Zillmann &amp;Bryant, 1982, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;Koss et al. 1994; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] 1993&lt;/ref&gt; sexual assault&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, 1993; Malamuth, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of degradation of women&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Dworkin]], 1979, 1988; MacKinnon, 1985, 1989, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that perhaps GR is partly to blame for an increase in anti-female attitudes and behaviors. It is difficult to tell whether GR directly causes misogynous attitudes or if it serves to increase preexisting anti-female cultural values.&lt;ref name="Wester" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Jennings, and Dolf Zillmann. Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. Mahwah, NJ: L. Elbaum Associates, 2002. web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faludi, Susan. Backlash: the Undeclared War against American Women. New York: Anchor, 1992. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine A. Women's Lives, Men's Laws. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP.2005. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malamuth | first1 = Neil M | year = 1981 | title = Rape Proclivity Among Males | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 138–54 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1981.tb01075.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea. "Against the Male Flood: Censorship, Pornography and Equality." Harvard Women's Law Journal (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between rap music and other types of music is that the [[lyrics]] are generally the main focus of attention.&lt;ref name="Nagayama" /&gt; Rappers seem to commit themselves to worst impulses by telling their stories in the first-person.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

In a study conducted by Barongan and Hall (1995), they had male college students listen to rap music with misogynous or neutral song lyrics. After listening to the different music, they viewed three different vignettes. These vignettes were either sexual-violent, neutral, or assaultive. Then the students were asked to choose one of the three vignettes to show a female. Those who had listened to the misogynous music were significantly more likely to show the female the assaultive vignette.&lt;ref name="Fischer" /&gt;

Regarding gangsta rap [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] states that, "The harder that you are, sad to say, the more you sell".&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, James T. IV. 1993. "Female Rappers Go With the Gangsta Flow." USA Today (October 5): 6D.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hip-hop ===
Misogyny was not found in [[rap music]] until the 1980s even though it had been in the commercial market for 10 years.  Some artists such as [[2 Live Crew]], [[Ice-T]], and [[N.W.A.]] integrated misogynous lyrics into their rap songs. Women are reduced to objects – specifically objects that are only good for abuse, sex and for the most part are just trouble for men within misogynous rap. Using such misogynistic lyrics allows degradation of their female counterparts while boosting themselves up.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = Terri M. | last2 = Fuller | first2 = Douglas B. | year = 2006 | title = The Words Have Changed but the Ideology Remains the Same Misogynistic Lyrics in Rap Music | url = | journal = Journal of Black Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 938–57 | doi=10.1177/0021934704274072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance of misogyny can be seen in many rap lyrics. For example, in N.W.A's "She Swallowed It" (1991) gives a clear description;&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"One Less Bitch." Efil4zaggin. Ruthless/Priority. CDL 57126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes of physical harm can be seen in Too $hort "All My Bitches Are Gone"(1993);&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1993a. "All My Bitches Are Gone." Get In Where You Fit In. Jive/Zomba. 01241-41526-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Eminem]] is well known for his rap music containing extremely misogynous lyrics. In 2002 his Album ''The Eminem Show'' sold 7.4 million copies.&lt;ref name="Fischer" /&gt;

=== Heavy metal ===
In a study conducted by Lawrence and Joyner, it was found that people exposed to sexually violent or [[heavy metal music]] were found to have a higher tendency on sex-role stereotyping in comparison to those who listened to classical music.&lt;ref name="St.Lawrence" /&gt; Researchers suggest that; distrust, assault, and negative regard for women are common attitudes experienced by fans of different types of rock music.&lt;ref name="St.Lawrence" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = Jeffery | year = 1991 | title = Heavy Metal Music and Reckless Behavior Among Adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 573–92 | doi=10.1007/bf01537363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inconclusive link ===
Most violent lyrics are not heard due to the fact a large number of listeners are not actually listening to the lyrics. This is very different from video-based media, in which the audience can see the violent message very clearly. It has also been found that some rock lyrics are so distorted that people just assume what they are actually saying. A majority of people often listen to just the music and not the lyrics while some listen to it while focusing on other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Craig A., Nicholas L. Carnagey, and Janie Eubanks.

Research of rap music also suggests that it may contain positive images. Zillman et al. proposed that rap music is used as a way to fight oppression from the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zillmann | first1 = D. | last2 = Aust | first2 = C. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = K. | last4 = Love | first4 = C. | last5 = Ordman | first5 = V.Pope | year = 1995 | title = Radical rap: Does it further ethnic division? | url = | journal = Basic and Applied Social Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 1–2| pages = 1–25 | doi=10.1080/01973533.1995.9646098}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found by Kubrin that 68 percent of all gangsta rap's focal point is about respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kubrin | first1 = C | year = 2005 | title = Gangstas, thugs, and hustlas: Identity and the code of the street in rap music | url = | journal = Social Problems | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 360–378 | doi=10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Kate | last2 = Dixon | first2 = Travis L. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Yuanyuan | year = 2009 | title = Controversial Rap Themes, Gender Portrayals and Skin Tone Distortion: A Content Analysis of Rap Music Videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 134–56 | doi=10.1080/08838150802643795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "cultural response to historic oppression and racism, [and] a system for communication among black communities throughout the United States."

==Violent and aggressive videos==

===In music===
[[Image:AMTV.png|thumb|''[[AMTV]]'', the name of MTV's music programming since 2009]]
Felson, professor of crime, law, and justice and sociology at Penn State, states that a crowd of onlookers enjoys a street fight just as the Romans enjoyed the [[gladiators]].&lt;ref name="Felson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felson | first1 = Richard B | year = 1996 | title = Mass Media Effects on Violent Behavior | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 103–28 | doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found frequently in ''MTV'' music videos are images of crime, sex, dance, visual abstraction and violence.

Violence and sex or the combination of the two, are most often used for a [[Shock value|shocking effect]] on viewers.&lt;ref name="Andsager" /&gt;

==== Rock ====
In a content analysis of rock music videos, Vincent, Davis and Boruszkowski found that 57 percent showed women in a "patronizing" way (such as; victims, sex objects, and stupid) and 20 percent of them were found placed in traditional sex roles (domestic, motherly, and submissive), another eight percent demonstrated women receiving violence from a male. The amount where women were shown as equal to men was only fourteen percent.&lt;ref name= "Vincent"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vincent | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Davis | first2 = D.

==== Rap ====
Johnson et al. found that women portrayed in sexually inferior roles in rap music videos have increased girls’ acceptance of teen dating violence. They also found that these videos did not increase boy's acceptance of teen violence.&lt;ref name="Kalof"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalof | first1 = Linda | year = 1999 | title = The Effects of Gender and Music Video Imagery on Sexual Attitudes | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 139 | issue = 3| pages = 378–385 | doi=10.1080/00224549909598393 | pmid=10410622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Ashburn | first3 = L. | last4 = Reed | first4 = W. | year = 1995 | title = Differential gender effects of exposure to rap music on African American adolescents' acceptance of teen dating violence | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 597–605 | doi=10.1007/bf01544683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers-Flanagan found that not only are women shown in a position of submission to men, they are also shown in a more negative light than men in rap music videos.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Kate | last2 = Dixon | first2 = Travis L. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Yuanyuan | year = 2009 | title = Controversial Rap Themes, Gender Portrayals and Skin Tone Distortion: A Content Analysis of Rap Music Videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 134–56 | doi=10.1080/08838150802643795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommers" /&gt; Conrad et al. found that recent (2009) rap music videos emphasize themes of misogyny, materialism and women tend to be placed in a position of objectification.&lt;ref name="Conrad" /&gt;

In addition to women being placed in objectified positions, they are "criticized and loved at the same time for being covered up versus being scantily dressed."&lt;ref name="America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rebollo-Gil|first1=Guillermo|last2=Moras|first2=Amanda|title=Black Women and Black Men in Hip Hop Music: Misogyny, Violence and the Negotiation of (White-Owned) Space|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=2012|volume=1|issue=45|pages=118–32|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00898.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the rap industry are most commonly only mentioned by the media when it is to further stigmatize men, or to promote the stereotype that all black women are on welfare or are gold-diggers.&lt;ref name="America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rebollo-Gil|first1=Guillermo|last2=Moras|first2=Amanda|title=Black Women and Black Men in Hip Hop Music: Misogyny, Violence and the Negotiation of (White-Owned) Space|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=2012|volume=1|issue=45|pages=118–32|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00898.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
In a 1998 study conducted by Tracy L. Dietz, professor of [[Sociology]] &amp; [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Central Florida]], sampled 33 prominent Nintendo and Sega games and found that nearly 80 percent of the video games had some violence and aggression as part of the main strategy or object. Dietz claimed that violence was directed specifically towards women in 21% of the games sampled. Also in 28 percent of the games women were, according to Dietz, seen as sex objects and in 41 percent of the games there were no female characters. Overall Dietz asserted that most video games minimize the role of females or leave females out of the game all together, and that when females were shown they were usually depicted in a supporting role to men or dependent upon the male. Women were also seen as contributing less than males and were their sex objects. Dietz stated that these depictions of women may allow boys and girls to internalize and accept the thought that women are victims, weak, and sex objects.&lt;ref name= "Dietz" /&gt;

==Violent pornography==
By making misogyny sexual, pornography teaches misogyny to its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte. "Pornography." The Johns Hopkins University Press 9.2 (1997): 165–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative effects from pornography have been thought to occur due to a violence component, and not to a sexual component. Males who have been previously enraged by a female are more likely to produce aggression against a female after being shown pornography depicting violence.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Padgett | first1 = Vernon R. | last2 = Jo Ann | first2 = Brislin-Slütz | last3 = Neal | first3 = James A. | year = 1989 | title = Pornography, Erotica and Attitudes toward Women: The Effects of Repeated Exposure | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 479–91 | doi=10.1080/00224498909551529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of sex and aggression is increasingly being shown within pornographic material, therefore could be a possible trigger for aggressively willing men to physical assault accessible women.&lt;ref name= "Donnerstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donnerstein | first1 = Edward | last2 = Berkowitz | first2 = Leonard | year = 1981 | title = Victim Reactions in Aggressive Erotic Films as a Factor in Violence against Women | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 710–24 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.4.710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general's commission found that viewing of sexually aggressive pornography is causally connected to sexual violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.porn-report.com/521-sexually-violent-material.htm | title=''Attorney General's Commission on Pornography'' | publisher=United States Attorney General | date=July 1986 | accessdate=9 April 2015 | at=sec 5.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence portrayed in pornography as pleasurable to the victim may increase approval of sexual coercion, there by relating to sexual violence.&lt;ref name="St.Lawrence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koop"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koop | first1 = Everett C | year = 1987 | title = Report of the Surgeon General's Workshop on Pornography and Public Health | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 944–45 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.42.10.944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, E.

This theme can be seen to give reason for violence and decrease general inhibitions against aggression.&lt;ref name="Donnerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry, K ''Female sexual slavery''.

=== Usenet ===
Barron and Kimmel found that [[Usenet]] contains less consensual sex and more coercive sex in the scenes depicted. Within Usenet it was found that 62.7 percent of the scenes had a male perpetrators and only 42.4 percent of the scenes contained female perpetrators. Victims within Usenet was found to be females 84.7 percent of the time. At nearly no expense Usenet offers the greatest access to the largest number of viewers.&lt;ref name=Barron&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barron | first1 = Martin | last2 = Kimmel | first2 = Michael | year = 2000 | title = Sexual Violence in Three Pornographic Media: Toward a Sociological Explanation | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 161–68 | doi=10.1080/00224490009552033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influencing misogyny ===

A summary of the effects of pornography research by Linz and Donnerstein (1989) concluded that depictions of sexual violence in the media, under some conditions, promote antisocial attitudes and behavior. Linz and Donnerstein focused on the detrimental effects of exposure to violent images in pornography portraying the myth that women enjoy or in some way benefit from rape, torture, or other forms of sexual violence. Other research has found similar outcomes (e.g., Allen et al., 1995). The viewing of coercive pornography relates to the strongest acceptance of [[rape myths]], i.e. women want to be raped, women "ask for it", women want to be forced. Considering the commodification and objectification argument, concern exists that repeated exposure to coercive pornographic stimuli relates to increasingly negative attitudes toward women.  More frequent use increased the dehumanizing effect of Internet pornography and led to more acceptance of violence toward women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of long-term exposure to violent and sexually degrading depictions of women|pmid=3210143|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.758|journal=J Pers Soc Psychol|year=1988|volume=55|issue=5|pages=758–68|vauthors=Linz DG, Donnerstein E, Penrod S}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography has been found to desensitize societies to violence against women, inspiring rapes and contributing to the sexual subordination of women to men (2009).  Making their materials, pornographers exploit existing inequality between the sexes to coerce women and children to perform unwanted or dangerous sexual acts as a form of prostitution. Existing legal regulations in democratic societies have not approached pornography with these realities in mind, but usually rather as a right protected by freedom of expression, or as an "obscene" expression offending the public rather than harming any particular group. In rare but important instances, pornography has legally been seen as a harmful practice violating women's human or democratic rights to equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND EQUALITY DEFICIT: Legal Challenges to Pornography and Sex Inequality in Canada, Sweden, and the U.S.|url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Waltman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies consistently show that after exposure to pornography and other forms of misogynistic media depicting degradation of women and rape, including hip hop and rap, viewers show attitudes that are less sympathetic to rape victims and more tolerant and accepting of violence toward women – in effect, such behavior becomes more "normalized" and "mainstreamed. It's desensitizing and addictive potentials are well-documented in its users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lionlamb.org/mediaviolencefactsheet.pdf|title=The Influence of Media Violence on Youth|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206052957/http://lionlamb.org/mediaviolencefactsheet.pdf|archivedate=February 6, 2005|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2003|volume=4|number=3|authors=Craig A.

== Internet misogyny ==
Internet misogyny is enacted in different forms and on different platforms. When one objectifies or harasses online, they are likely doing so anonymously and using shaming tactics to stigmatize the victim's identity or body. In this anonymity, the objectifier averts all real-life responsibility while nonetheless enforcing real-life consequences for the woman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Levmore, Saul X., and Martha Craven Nussbaum.&amp;nbsp;''The Offensive Internet: Speech, Privacy, and Reputation''. Harvard University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic of anonymity fosters Internet objectification because it allows the objectifier to create a desired situation where the woman deals with the responsibilities instead of the objectifier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Monsters vs. Aliens''''' is a [[media franchise]] created by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. The franchise began with the 2009 film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' and has since grown to include a short film, two television specials, a television series, and a video game.

The franchise involves a group of monsters who are assigned by the [[US Government]] to defend [[Earth]] from various [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] and [[supernatural]] threats.

==Feature film==
{{main|Monsters vs. Aliens}}
''Monsters vs. Aliens''  is a 2009 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] 3-D [[science fiction]] [[action comedy]] [[film]]. It was DreamWorks Animation's first feature film to be directly produced in a [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3-D format instead of being converted into 3-D after completion, which added $15 million to the film's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Susan |last= Wloszczyna |title=First look: ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' is the ultimate; a 3-D 'first' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-03-10-monsters-aliens_N.htm |work=USA Today|date= March 11, 2008|accessdate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled for a May 2009 release, but the release date was moved to March 27, 2009. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray September 29, 2009, in North America and included the easter egg to the upcoming movies and previews. The film features the voices of [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Conrad Vernon]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Paul Rudd]].

===Possible sequel===
In April 2011, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies, like ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', and ''[[Megamind]]'', saying that these films "all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/04/dreamworks-pins-hopes-on-kung-fu-panda-2-after-first-quarter-earnings-fall-short-125845/|title=DreamWorks Animation Pins Hopes On 'Kung Fu Panda 2' After 1Q Earnings Fall Short|last=Lieberman|first=David|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==

===''B.O.B.'s Big Break''===
''B.O.B.'s Big Break'' is a 3D animated short film. The short premiered on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in 2D on September 26, 2009, and was released 3 days later in 2D and 3D on the ''Monsters vs Aliens'' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and the double DVD pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smash Hit Comedy, MONSTERS VS.

B.O.B., Dr. Cockroach, PhD, and The Missing Link are trying to outwit Captain W.R. Monger to escape from Area 52, the government's top-secret holding cell. Cockroach's escape attempt by feeding B.O.B. a chemical mixture to turn him into a bomb instead results in B.O.B. temporarily acquiring the ability to read minds, and allowing them to find out about a secret exit from Area 52. Unfortunately, the plan fails when B.O.B. smashes the jet they were using to escape believing it to be a [[piñata]], with the resulting explosion erasing B.O.B.'s new power.

Following the cliff hanger at the end of ''Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space'', the mutated carrot has spawned hundreds of zombie carrots which once they bite a victim they take control of the subject's mind. Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat the carrots and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots (specifically because B.O.B. has no brain and thus is immune to the carrots' mind control powers), which B.O.B eventually, albeit reluctantly, does. At the end of the short, B.O.B. is turned into a giant zombie carrot.

Susan and the fellow monsters go back to Susan's home in Modesto, California; just in time for Halloween celebrations. Susan spends time with her parents, while the other monsters join in trick-or-treating and collect a large amount of candy. Later, it is revealed that the monsters came to destroy mutant pumpkins disguised as Jack-o-lanterns. When the pumpkins begin to eat children's candies to grow larger, the monsters and children defeat them by throwing excessive candy to bloat them up and explode them. But, in a [[twist ending]], some of the pumpkin "blood" (a green goo that mutated the ordinary pumpkins) falls into a planting of carrots, causing a mutant carrot to be formed.

'''The Museum of Particularly Bad Art Exhibition''' (MOPBA) is an annual event held on [[Chapel Street]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] celebrating poor [[art]] forms, primarily in the forms of [[painting]]s and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. MOPBA relies on a core group of art pieces owned by [[Helen Round]] but the public are invited to enter pieces that are their own or that have been found that are considered poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/eish/kitsch-becomes-an-artform-in-australia-418024|title=Kitsch becomes an artform in Australia - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/er-dette-arets-verste-kunstverk_-1.7300495|title=Er dette årets verste kunstverk?|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event primarily is a charity event that funds three charities within the [[City of Stonnington|Stonnington]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694559243.html|title=Art that's no oil painting - Arts - www.theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The entries from the public are judged by meeting one point on the selection criteria. Selection points for entry of an art piece into MOPBA are:

* Completely devoid of technical skill ([[Colour]], [[Lightness (color)|tone]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[shading]]);
* Unusual, poor or tasteless subject matters;
* Passion of the [[artist]] but is driven by an [[Amateur|uneducated hand]];
* An instinctual feeling that the art piece is poor.

==History==

[[Image:Windsor Junkie.jpg|left|300px|thumbnail|''Windsor Junkie circa 1896'' - Itchiball Prize Winner 2005.]]
The founder of MOPBA is [[Helen Round]]. In the early 1990s, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' reported on the [[Museum of Bad Art]] in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], United States. At this point of her life, Round was in the process of establishing a retail shop named "Fat Helen’s Bric a Brac shop", that was to specialise in the [[kitsch]], inane and tasteless.  It was also a hobby of Round's to peruse [[op shop]]s, [[garage sale]]s and [[Market (place)|market]]s. She was inspired by what she came across in these places and commenced her pursuit of collecting and preserving the mediocre. Round started collecting in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Particularly Bad Art: About|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=2|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/kunst-in-melbourne-museum-der-haesslichkeiten-a-583180.html|title=Kunst in Melbourne: Museum der Hässlichkeiten|date=9 October 2008|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Round  has collected 200 examples of original art of poor taste. Of notable fame is the original portrait of [[actor]] [[Scott Baio]] that Round located in an op shop in the suburb of [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/suzanne-carbone/amanda-needs-love/2005/08/02/1122748636560.html|title=Amanda needs to be loved - Carbone &amp; Money - Opinion - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;

The Exhibition awards the Itchiball Prize to the submitted art piece that is considered by the public to be the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/deepend/dreadful-art/3339714|title=Dreadful art|date=8 August 2006|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a play on words and parody of the '[[Archibald Prize]]', Australia's most important [[portrait]]ure painting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Itchyball Prize|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=8|website=Museum of Particularly Bad Art|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">''''' Naissance du Cité'''''' was a "popular [[spectacle]]" held at the [[Vélodrome d'hiver]] on 18 October 1937 as part of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]].&lt;ref name="Art in France"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Christopher|title=Art in France, 1900-1940|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300099088|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22Birth+of+a+City%22+Leger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jxYeIQmBM8&amp;sig=XNjIYa8n8m8_tardBqzWtKpGNyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFq-XVt_HZAhUBWsAKHTSrBFsQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Birth%20of%20a%20City%22%20Leger&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[auteur]] for the event was [[Jean-Richard Bloch]]

The spectacle was based around the story of an oil-rich colony led by an engineer which was threatened by an imperialist power. However, following the intervention of the [[League of Nations]], there was a decision to pool the world's resource and an era of endless peace was ushered in. The drama unrolled to the sound of horns and sirens, radio news flashes and during the finale not only were there wrestling matches and athletic events, but the  cycle track of the Vélodrome d'hiver was used for a cycle race. There was a chorus - achieved by amplifying the voice of radio announcer, but original plans to project a film onto a big screen were dropped, in favour of an enormous back drop designed by [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref name="Art in France"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">'''Neo-[[Benshi]]''' is the practice of producing live alternate voice-overs for movies.

The art form’s acknowledged starting point is in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other East Asian nations during the silent film era. [[Benshi]] is a Japanese word referring to the oral "interpreter" who performed a live narrative accompaniment to silent movies, in lieu of showing intertitles with dialogue, etc. In Korean the practice is known as pyônsa. Currently, it is finding a resurgence among experimental poets in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles.

==Movietelling==
Movietelling is a reinstatement, or retelling, of the film narrator practice(s). Long time practitioner and one of the foremost scholars on the subject of live film narration, Walter Lew, coined this phrase with the intention of reviving and revamping what he considers to have been an international practice, finding its roots throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. In January 2008, Walter Lew, along with several poets and video artists, began shadoWord productions, an organization dedicated to the practice, as well as the evolution, of Movietelling.

{{literature}}
A '''play''' is a form of [[literature]] written by a [[playwright]], usually consisting of [[dialogue]] and singing between [[Character (arts)|characters]], intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theater]], to [[Community theatre]], as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably [[George Bernard Shaw]], who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term "play" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/play "Play"]: [[Dictionary.com]] website. Retrieved on January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres==
[[File:P culture.svg|thumb|right|upright|Symbol of theatre]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. [[Comedy|Comedies]] were one of the two original play types of [[Ancient Greece]], along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', or for a more modern example the skits from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchon.tripod.com/indexGREEKTH.html|title=THE ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA &amp; THEATRE HISTORY PAGE|publisher=anarchon.tripod.com|accessdate=2008-06-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatrehist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates001.html|title=Origin of Comedy|publisher=www.theatrehistory.com|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farce====
{{Main article|Farce}}
A generally nonsensical genre of play, [[farce]]s are often acted and often involve  humor. An example of a farce includes [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', or [[Mark Twain]]'s play ''[[Is He Dead?]]''.

====Satirical====
{{Main article|Satire}}
A [[satirical|satire]] play takes a comic look at current events  people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out [[corruption]]. An example of a satire would be [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.

====Restoration comedy====
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.F.|title=Marriage of Convenience and the Moral Code of Restoration Comedy|journal=Essays of Criticism|date=1962|pages=370–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content.  However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.

It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in [[Molière]]’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ornament of Action|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre.  This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century.  However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Styan|first1=J.L.|title=Restoration Comedy in Performance|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon" /&gt;

===Historical===
{{Main article|History (theatrical genre)}}
[[File:An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London]]

These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by [[William Shakespeare]]. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and William Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production.  Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.

By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|title=American Musical Theatre|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

===Theatre of Cruelty===
This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.”  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.

Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.

His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.

Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.

One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.

Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "[[musical theatre|musical]]", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used.

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A '''poetry reading''' is a public oral [[recitation]] or performance of [[poetry]].

==Background==
Voice is an active, physical thing in oral poetry. It needs a speaker and a listener, a performer and an audience. It is a bodily creation that thrives in live connection.
The voice is the mechanism by which a "poet's voice" comes alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hirsch, Edward|title=Voice – A Poet's Glossary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=New York|year=2014|isbn=9780151011957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciting a poem aloud the reciter comes to understand and then to be the 'voice' of the poem.&lt;ref name=Hollander&gt;{{cite book|author=Hollander, John|title=Committed to Memory|publisher=Riverhead Books|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9781885983152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As poetry is a vocal art, the speaker brings their own experience to it, changing it according to their own sensibilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pinsky, Robert|title=The Art of Poetry (Interview with Downing and Kunitz)|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; intonation, the matter of sound making sense; controlled through pitch and stress, poems are full of invisible italicized contrasts.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Reading poetry aloud also makes clear the "pause" as an element of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pinsky, Robert|title=Reading Aloud|publisher=New Yorker|date=April 27, 2009|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/reading-aloud-with-robert-pinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The hearing knowledge we bring to a line if poetry is a knowledge of patterns of speech we have known since we were infants." Every speaker intuitively course through manipulations of sounds, almost as if we sing to each other all day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pinsky, Robert|title=The 'Sounds of Poetry'|publisher=Farrer Strauss &amp; Giroux|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=0374266956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after three millennia of writing, poetry retains its appeal to the ear, the silent reading eye thereof, thereafter, hears what it is seeing.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Sound that was imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems in performance.&lt;ref name="HallThankYouNewYorker"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hall, Donald|title=Thank You Thank You|work=New Yorker|date=October 26, 2012|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/thank-you-thank-you|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public reading is typically given on a small stage in a [[café]]&lt;ref&gt;'The Poetry Place' at Covent Garden London. {{cite web|url=http://poetrysociety.org.uk/poetry-cafe|title=The Poetry Cafe|work=The Poetry Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bookselling|bookstore]], although reading by prominent poets frequently are booked into larger venues such as [[amphitheater]]s and college auditoriums, 'to take poetry public'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpoetry.net/about|title=Words Alive: Taking Poetry Public}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry readings almost always involve poets reading their own work or reciting it from memory but readings often involve several readers (often called "featured poets" or "featureds"), although normally one poet is chosen as a "[[headliner (performances)|headliner]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox, Charles|title=What is the difference between a poetry slam and a poetry reading?|work=Quora.com|date=February 2011|url=https://quora.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-poetry-slam-and-a-poetry-reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

American poet [[Donald Hall]] described the increase in emphasis on public readings of poetry in the United States in a 2012 ''New Yorker'' magazine blog post where he recounted it a phenomenon that grew in the last half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="HallThankYouNewYorker"/&gt;

Hall, who speculates that the change may have been due to the star power of [[Dylan Thomas]], wrote, "It used to be that one poet in each generation performed poems in public. In the twenties, it was [[Vachel Lindsay]], who sometimes dropped to his knees in the middle of a poem. Then Robert Frost took over, and made his living largely on the road."&lt;ref name="HallThankYouNewYorker" /&gt; Hall suggests that poetry readings have shifted the focus of poetry more towards sound, adding that "In concentrating on sound, as in anything else, there are things to beware of. Revising a poem one morning, I found myself knowing that a new phrase was repellent, but realized it would pass if I intoned it out loud. Watch out. A poem must work from the platform but it must also work on the page."&lt;ref name="HallThankYouNewYorker" /&gt;

==Poetry slam==

A [[poetry slam]] is a competitive format that has become increasingly popular, especially in the [[United States]], since its inception in the 1980s. A "slam" is the art of poetry presented in public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Brief Guide to Slam Poetry|publisher=American Academy of American Poets|location=New York|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-slam-poetry|date=May 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the "[[open mic]]" event variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poetry.about.com/od/livepoetry/a/openmic.htm|author=Holman, Bob|title=Open Mic: The Definition|work=About.com|location=New York|access-date=2016-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303162012/http://poetry.about.com/od/livepoetry/a/openmic.htm|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a basic repertoire has been extended to refer to groups which focus mainly on performing standard works, as in [[repertory theater]] or repertoire [[ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Ripley410112.gif|right|thumb|370px|[[Robert Ripley]]'s ''Believe It or Not'' (January 12, 1941)]]
'''''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''''' is an American franchise, founded by [[Robert Ripley]], which deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper [[Panel (comics)|panel]], the ''Believe It or Not'' feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic book]]s, a chain of museums, and a book series.

The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-based [[Ripley Entertainment|Ripley Entertainment, Inc.]], a division of the [[Jim Pattison Group]], is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.

Ripley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, ''Champs and Chumps'', and it premiered on December 19, 1918, in the ''[[New York Globe]]''. Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to ''Believe It or Not''.  When the ''Globe'' folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York Evening Post]]''. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by [[Associated Newspapers (U.S.)|Associated Newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Neal. ''A Curious Man: The Strange &amp; Brilliant Life of Robert "Believe It Or Not!" Ripley'' (Crown/Archetype, 2014), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the ''Globe''). That same year, Ripley hired [[Norbert Pearlroth]] as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Norbert Pearlroth, 89, Researcher For 52 Years For 'Believe It Or Not' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/obituaries/norbert-pearlroth-89-researcher-for-52-years-for-believe-it-or-not.html |quote=Norbert Pearlroth, who combed hundreds of thousands of books in the New York Public Library over 52 years as sole researcher for ''Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' died of heart and kidney diseases Thursday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn.

Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York American]]'' and was picked up by the [[King Features Syndicate]], being quickly syndicated on an international basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''A Curious Man'', pp. 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included [[Paul Frehm]] (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), [[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|Bob Clarke]] (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of ''Believe It or Not!'' for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as did [[Wally Wood]] and [[Ernie Kovacs]], who also did a recurring satire called "Strangely Believe It!" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'', John Hix's ''[[Strange as it Seems]]'', and Gordon Johnston's ''[[It Happened in Canada]]''. The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/ripleysbelieveitornot |title=Ripley's Believe It or Not Comic Strip on |website=Gocomics.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.

''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was "a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mendelson, Lee |title=Charlie Brown &amp; Charlie Schulz |year=1970 |publisher=The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for ''Peanuts''' [[Snoopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles M.|last=Schulz|title=Around the world in 50 years: Charlie Brown's anniversary celebration|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1994|page=11|isbn=978-0-8362-1766-7|authorlink=Charles M.

The people whose items are featured in such books as [[Ripley's Believe It or Not Annual|''Strikingly True'']], have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. "Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me."&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maynard's Spooky Action...An Interview with Edward Meyer from Ripley's Believe It or Not|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-161-19-nov-2011|website=[[The Skeptic Zone]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated.&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"/&gt;

==Radio==
On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought "Believe It or Not" to [[radio]], the first of several series heard on [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}. Pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by [http://www.otr.com/ripley_on_radio.html Ripley On Radio], Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's ''Saturday Party'', Ripley was the host of ''[[The Baker's Broadcast]]'' from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. ''See America First with Bob Ripley'' (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into ''See All the Americas'', a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on [[World War II]]. ''Romance, Rhythm and Ripley'' aired on CBS in 1945, followed by ''Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook'' (1947–48).

Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from [[Buenos Aires]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matineeclassics.com/radio/1930/ripleys_believe_it_or_not/details/ |title=Old Time Radio Shows - Ripley's Believe It or Not!

As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall cigarettes]] and [[General Foods]]. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to [[television]].

==Films, television, Internet, and computer game==
The newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows.

===Film===
* Ripley hosted a series of two dozen ''Believe It or Not!'' theatrical short films between 1930 and 1932 for [[Warner Bros.]] [[Vitaphone]].

*He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, ''Seasons Greetings'' (1931), with [[Ruth Etting]], [[Joe Penner]], [[Ted Husing]], [[Thelma White]], [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], and others.
* Ripley's short films were parodied in a 1939 [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] titled ''Believe It or Else''. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by [[Tex Avery]] and written by [[Dave Monahan]], it featured a running gag in which [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)#Egghead|Egghead]] (a prototype [[Elmer Fudd]]) appeared to declare, "I don't believe it!"  On 5 November of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, ''Fresh Fish'', was released. Written by [[Jack Miller (writer)|Jack Miller]], this cartoon's running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, "Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?"
*[[20th Century Fox]] produced another [[film short]] titled '''Acquitted By The Sea''', released September 27, 1940, produced by [[Truman Talley]] and directed by [[Earl Allvine]]. This told an unusual story involving the ''[[Titanic]]''.

====Planned film====
On October 4, 2004, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film would be produced by [[James Jacks]] and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, "It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened." Jacks also said, "We want to turn it into an ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', a goofy version, as played by [[Johnny Depp]]. When they saw we had the writers from ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt|Larry Flynt]]'', they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]-type movie with one of their characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=Paramount Telling Ripley Tale: Believe It or Not|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/04/paramount-telling-ripley-tale|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=IGN|date=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2005, it was announced that [[Tim Burton]] would direct the film, with [[Jim Carrey]] starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey May Believe|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/29/burton-carrey-may-believe|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jacks, [[Sean Daniel]] and [[Richard D. Zanuck]] were also to serve as producers for the film.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011/&gt; Zanuck spent six weeks in China to [[Location scouting|scout filming locations]] for the project.&lt;ref name=Borat/&gt;

On June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's ''Believe It or Not'' column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project, ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Gardner|first2=Chris|title=Burton takes rain check on Par pic|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/burton-takes-rain-check-on-par-pic-1200337853/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey put 'Believe' on hold|url=https://variety.com/2006/more/news/burton-carrey-put-believe-on-hold-1200337840/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Oedekerk brings 'Ripley' back to life|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/oedekerk-brings-ripley-back-to-life-1117955948/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding.&lt;ref name=Borat&gt;{{cite news|title=Borat's New-er Look|url=https://variety.com/2007/voices/columns/borats_newer_lo-1200571196/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Carrey lights up 'Phillip Morris'|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/carrey-lights-up-phillip-morris-1117966194/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton Off Believe It or Not?

In October 2008, [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Siegel|first2=Tatiana|title=Chris Columbus in talks for 'Ripley's': Paramount wants director for long-delayed film|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/chris-columbus-in-talks-for-ripley-s-1117994548/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Eric Roth]] was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Eric Roth takes on Ripley project: Jim Carrey remains attached to topline|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/eric-roth-takes-on-ripley-project-1118030181/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum in Bangalore - Jim Ankan Deka photo.jpg|thumb|Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum at Innovative Film City in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].]]
When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933, it was labeled Ripley’s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who "fainted" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], and [[Cleveland]]. In [[New York City|New York]], the famed [[Times Square]] exhibit opened in 1939 on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].

{{as of|2010|12}}, there are 32 Ripley's ''Believe It or Not!'' Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of ''Believe It or Not!'', are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]] and [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. Others are constructed oddly, such as the [[Orlando, Florida]] Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking.
Expected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the [[Netherlands]], at Dam square in [[Amsterdam]].

Prior to becoming home to his vast collections from his many travels, "The Castle", as it is known, was once a hotel which played host to many famous guests, including Ripley himself and author/owner [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]. It was originally a [[Moorish Revival style]] mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home. Its popularity and success led Ripley's associates to open new establishments throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is also rumored to be haunted. Segments of the most recent Ripley's TV series were filmed here, including the opening credits.

It looks as if it has survived a major earthquake. Its interior and exterior feature cracks throughout, adhering to the theme. The Ripley's Company has since opened several other attractions in the area, including a "four-dimensional" theater, a state-of-the-art aquarium, a haunted factory, several arcades, two miniature golf courses, and a mirror maze all of which carry the Ripley's brand name and signature logo.

==Inaccuracies==
Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their [[television]] show, where they often say "If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real". However, two claims{{specify|date=December 2010}} appearing in their books have been dubbed "myths" by  [[MythBusters]].[Which ones?] One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], has had its accuracy called into question by [[Snopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/misxlate/toux.asp |title=Ma Sacrée Toux! |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ripley's'' has reported the urban legend of [[Frank Tower]] - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], [[RMS Empress of Ireland|RMS ''Empress of Ireland'']], and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] - as being factual.  However, this story has been debunked by several sources.&lt;ref name= TitanicForDummies&gt;{{Citation | author = Spignes, Stephen J.  | title = The Titanic For Dummies | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jqO__ScTpnMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9781118206508&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MjzxUqmrK6_lygGWqoCwBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20clark&amp;f=false | work = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | date = 2012 | accessdate = 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= EncyTintanica&gt;{{Citation | author = Molony, Senan | title = On the Trail of 'Lucky' Tower | url = http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/lucky-tower.html | work = Encyclopedia Titanica | date =  2004 | accessdate = 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Schoolgirl Strikers'''''|スクールガールストライカーズ|Sukūrugāru Sutoraikāzu}} is a Japanese [[social network game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]].

== Plot ==
The newly established private high school for girls, Goryoukan Academy, has a hidden face that people on the outside don't know about. The world you know is under threat by aliens, named "Oburi" (apparitions). These enemies are too strong for normal humans, and are especially threatening due to the fact that they can travel through to the 'fourth' dimension where they can be safe. For some reason, certain young girls are able to harness the power to transverse these dimensions, and enter a 'fifth' dimension - a [[multiverse|parallel universe]].

The only ones capable of fighting this enemy of mankind are girls known as "Strikers", who have the ability to sense the fifth dimension. Goryoukan Academy is actually an organization that seeks out girls who are more than meets the eye and trains them up for the "Fifth Force", a combat force created to subjugate the Oburi.

There are endless amounts of parallel universes, all of which are similar but run in their own way. The Strikers are able to fight the Oburi by searching these alternate worlds for alternative "[[Memory card]]" (Memoca) costumes that are usable by them and effective against the "Oburi".

You have been chosen by a mysterious person to lead a group of 5 girls in defeating an enemy that is threatening to destroy the world. Why you were chosen and who you are yourself is a mystery...

Schoolgirl Strikers is a card collecting mobile game with [[Role-playing game|RPG]] and [[visual novel]] influences. It was released in 2014 and is available for iOS and Android devices. Some of the things that make Schoolgirl Strikers different from your average card collecting game are the special story missions and the 3D battle system; along with the ability to dress the girls up as you see fit. The way the battle system as a whole works is also quite different; you can choose any girls you want (limited to 5 at a time) to be in your team as long as you have at least one card of them. Then you add main and sub "Memocas" to them instead of just simply putting the cards themselves in a battle deck. The main Memocas also affect the girls' appearances in battle.

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===
{{Main|Video game writing}}
With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.
* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)&amp;mdash;[[John Turturro]] plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on [[William Faulkner]]).
* ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this comedy written by [[Barry Primus]] and [[J. F. Lawton]], [[Robert Wuhl]] is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script - but no career. [[Martin Landau]] is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Eli Wallach]] - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this satire of the Hollywood system, [[Tim Robbins]] plays a movie producer who thinks he’s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.
* ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'' (2002)&amp;mdash;[[Nicolas Cage]] portrays real-life screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] (as well as his fictional brother, Donald) as Kaufman struggles to adapt an esoteric book ([[Susan Orlean]]’s real-life nonfiction work ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' ) into an action-filled Hollywood screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| title=Interview with Charlie Kaufman| publisher=chasingthefrog.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810022733/http://chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| archivedate=2007-08-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dreams on Spec]]'' (2007)&amp;mdash;The only documentary to follow aspiring screenwriters as they struggle to turn their scripts into movies, the film also features wisdom from established scribes like [[James L. Brooks]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Gary Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/entertainment/et-scriptland18 | title=Producers, writers face huge chasm: Compensation for digital media and residuals for reuse of content are major issues as contract talks begin |journal=Los Angeles Times |date= July 18, 2007 |author=Jay A. Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Seven Psychopaths]]'' (2012)&amp;mdash;In this satire, written and directed by [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Colin Farrell]] plays a screenwriter who is struggling to finish his screenplay ''Seven Psychopaths'', but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a Shih Tzu owned by a vicious gangster.
* ''[[Trumbo (2015 film)|Trumbo]]'' (2015)&amp;mdash;Highly successful Hollywood screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]], played in this [[biopic]] by [[Bryan Cranston]], is targeted by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for his socialist views, sent to federal prison for refusing to cooperate, and [[House Un-American Activities Committee#Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] from working in Hollywood, yet continues to write and subsequently wins two Academy Awards while using pseudonyms.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E. Biederman|edition=5th|author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser |author5=Charles J. Biederman |author6=Kenneth J. Abdo |author7=Scott D. Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to [[Orson Scott Card]] and others, "showing" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{refimprove|date=August 2008}}
A '''spoiler''' is an element of a disseminated summary or description of any piece of [[fiction]] that reveals any [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, the details of the conclusion of the plot, including the climax and ending, are especially regarded as spoiler material. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer would not want to know beforehand. Because enjoyment of fiction depends a great deal upon the suspense of revealing plot details through standard narrative progression, the prior revelation of how things will turn out can "spoil" the enjoyment that some consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced. Spoilers can be found in message boards, articles, reviews, commercials, and movie trailers.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==On the Internet==
The term spoiler was introduced in the early days of the Internet, and came to prominence in [[newsgroup]] conversations. It is still common in [[internet]] articles and [[social media]] discussions. Early rules of [[netiquette]] insisted that spoilers could and should be normally avoided, but if the posting of "spoiling" information was unavoidable, it be preceded by a warning such as "SPOILER ALERT", or the spoiler itself has to be masked so that it can not be visible to any but those keen for details and not fazed at the thought of such potentially plot-revealing information.

Sometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately (see below), and some unwitting readers have had [[literature]], [[film]]s, [[television]] programmes and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing "spoiled".&lt;ref name=howsoon&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Jicha |url=http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |title=How soon is too soon for spoilers? |date=2009-01-23 |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |accessdate=2016-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203105208/http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common demand, especially among internet users, to have protection against accidentally seeing material considered to include "spoiler" information, even in the internet version of settings where such material has conventionally and historically appeared, such as discussion groups or literary reviews. As a result of this level of objection to spoilers, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]] may post them purely for their own pleasure, finding amusement in believing they are completely ruining a narrative experience for others. On reputable websites, these can be reported to [[forum moderator|moderators]] and such posts taken down, the posters blacklisted, but only after the fact. Most such websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Some{{who|date=January 2016}} have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up "closed" websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.

On [[Usenet]], the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as 'spoiler space' – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line [[Dumb terminal|terminal]]. A simple cipher called [[ROT13]] is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.

Some producers actively seed bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' orchestrated a "disinformation campaign" where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.&lt;ref name=foilers&gt;{{cite news | author = Hugh Hart | url = https://www.wired.com/2009/01/new-lost-season | title = Spoiler Wars Heat Up as Lost Returns | date = 2009-01-21 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning, although it previously did prior to 2006. Matthew Prichard, the grandson of [[Agatha Christie]], criticized Wikipedia for giving away spoilers in the play "The Mousetrap". Andrew Jarecki, the producer of ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]'', a documentary, argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts. The plot of ''Catfish'' had been posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film had been shown at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]]. Jay Walsh, a [[Wikimedia Foundation]] spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is intended to be an exhaustive knowledge source, so it would have spoilers.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Noam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/business/media/18spoiler.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1284931453-Cougj2fpRsBoD+tJX2gG5g Spoiler Alert: Whodunit? Wikipedia Will Tell You]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 17, 2010. Retrieved on August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some internet forums and reference sites, such as [[TV Tropes]] and the [[IMDb]] FAQ section, have optional spoiler tags covering major plot details. The information underneath may be revealed by highlighting the text or, in the case of IMDb, rolling over the spoiler tag.

In 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story "spoiled" enjoyed the story more than the subjects who didn't know the ending in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer, Jonah. "[https://www.wired.com/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don't Spoil Anything]." ''[[Wired (magazine)]]''. August 10, 2011. Retrieved on October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some applications that prevent users from reading spoilers, such as [[TVShow Time]]'s [[Google Chrome extension]], which, once set up, blocks posts on [[social media]] about episodes that the user has not seen.

==In print or other media==
One of the first print uses of the terms was in the April 1971 issue of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |title=National Lampoon Issue #14 |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Table of Contents |date=April 1971 |publisher=[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207072228/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article entitled "Spoilers," by [[Doug Kenney]], lists spoilers for famous films and movies.

[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Ebert]] in 2007]]
In 2005, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote an article entitled "Critics have no right to play spoiler" which contained spoilers and spoilers warnings.&lt;ref name="CST01"/&gt; Ebert wrote:

:The characters in movies do not always do what we would do. Sometimes they make choices that offend us. That is their right. It is our right to disagree with them. It is not our right, however, to destroy for others the experience of being as surprised by those choices as we were. A few years ago, I began to notice "spoiler warnings" on Web-based movie reviews -- a shorthand way of informing the reader that a key plot point was about to be revealed. Having heard from more than a few readers accusing me of telling too much of the story, I began using such warnings in my reviews.

Ebert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying "If you have not yet seen ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' and know nothing about the plot, read no further" and later said, "Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit." Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled ''[[The Crying Game]]'' and also noted a detail about the film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. Ebert also mentioned two films alongside ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''.&lt;ref name="CST01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050129/COMMENTARY/501290301 |title=Critics have no right to play spoiler |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Roger Ebert |date=2005-01-29 |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebert additionally criticized two commentators, [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Michael Medved]] (the latter of whom had "for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic"), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character's life decision. "[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?" Ebert asked. "The [[separation of church and state]] in [[United States of America|America]] was wisely designed to prevent [[religions]] from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs."&lt;ref name="CST01" /&gt;

In an interview about his ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 [[Marvel Comic]] adaptation ''[[The Gunslinger Born]]''), [[Stephen King]] was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone's experience of the comic. "There are no spoilers!", King replied, "You might as well say 'I'm never gonna watch ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' again because I know how it comes out'".

The executive producer of ''Doctor Who'', [[Steven Moffat]], expressed disappointment with fans who revealed spoilers after a leaked copy of "The Impossible Astronaut" was made available online before the episode's first television broadcast.

In April 2015, the [[Under the Gun Theater]] created ''Swarm of Spoilers'', a parody show based on [[George R.R. Martin]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the [[HBO]] television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed ''Swarm of Spoilers'', stated: "I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title," though he went on to say, "There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [''Swarm of Spoilers'']." &lt;!-- Is this referring to Christenfeld &amp; Leavitt, 2011? --&gt; The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]].&lt;ref name="Redeye Purdom"&gt;Purdom, Gwendolyn [http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/theater/redeye-swarm-of-spoilers-game-of-thrones-chicago-20150331-story.html Under the Gun Theater produces on 'Game of Thrones' parody show].

==Plot==
The series tells the story of five students, Yuta Hoshitani, Toru Nayuki, Kaito Tsukigami, Kakeru Tengenji, and Shu Kuga as they struggle to enter the Musical Department of Ayanagi Academy, an elite school for aspiring musical performers. They want to be accepted to the Star Frame Class, which is directly taught by the members of the Kao Council, the most talented students from the Musical Department who stand at the top within the academy. Luckily, they are spotted by Itsuki Otori, one of Kao Council members who puts them on his Star Team.

==Characters==

===Team Otori===
;{{nihongo|Yuta Hoshitani|星谷 悠太|Hoshitani Yūta}}
:{{voiced by|[[Natsuki Hanae]]}}
:Hoshitani is the bright and cheerful member of Team Otori. In the fall of his 2nd year in middle school, he was deeply touched by a certain high schooler's performance. Following that student who was wearing an Ayanagi Academy musical department uniform, he enters Ayanagi. In middle school he was in the ordinary department, and is basically an amateur concerning musicals and theater. However, his motivation and absorption of skills is top notch, and is a mood-maker who can be bright and optimistic no matter how hard the obstacle is. His roommate is Toru Nayuki.

;{{nihongo|Toru Nayuki|那雪 透|Nayuki Tōru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kensho Ono]]}}
:Nayuki is the kind and gentle member of Team Otori that Hoshitani met during the entrance ceremony, and later on they find out that they are roommates. He initially had no intention of applying for the music department, only auditioning because of Hoshitani, but he came to love performing and becomes one of Hoshitani's closest friends. He has stage fright, which can be repelled by letting him drink a special tea which is a specialty of the Nayuki family.

;{{nihongo|Kaito Tsukigami|月皇 海斗|Tsukigami Kaito}}
:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]}}
:With his father as a famous director, his mother as one of the most prolific theatrical actresses in Japan, and his older brother a musical genius, it was only natural for Tsukigami to enter Ayanagi. However, he greatly dislikes being compared to his family, especially his older brother who is an alumnus of Ayanagi. Though coming off as stiff and somewhat strict, Tsukigami gradually comes to care greatly for his companions especially after Hoshitani stands up for him, followed by his fellow teammates. He aims to become an actor. His roommate is Shu Kuga.

;{{nihongo|Kakeru Tengenji|天花寺 翔|Tengenji Kakeru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}}
:As a famous Kabuki actor from a well-known family, Tengenji has pride issues, looking down upon those who are not in the same class as him. Because he's lived in a world full of adults from a very young age, he is bad at communicating with peers, and does not fully understand the concept of friends, but because of the kindness and that Hoshitani showed him, he learns how to appreciate others. Due to being popular, he has gained a lot of female fans, and there have been rumors that the noise from his dorm room came from bringing women in. These rumors are proven false upon the introduction of Tavian, Tengenji's pet cat that he loves dearly.

;{{nihongo|Shu Kuga|空閑 愁|Kuga Shū}}
:{{voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}
:Kuga is the quiet and aloof member of Team Otori. After the death of his father, Kuga wanted to make his mother happy by imitating the musicals he saw on television, which led to him pursuing the musical world. According to Toraishi, being late for the musical department auditions has caused Kuga to be a member of Team Otori even though he had the skills to become a member of Team Hiragi. He gets along fairly well with his fellow members although maintains his silent demeanor. He works part-time at a bar with a piano, because he wanted to work in a place with something musical-related. His piano skills are self-taught, while his drawing skills are poor. His roommate is Kaito Tsukigami.

===Team Hiragi===
;{{nihongo|Rui Tatsumi|辰己 琉唯|Tatsumi Rui}}
:{{voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]}}
:Tatsumi is the leader of Team Hiragi who attended the same middle school as Tsukigami and Nayuki. He has always wanted to surpass Tsukigami even at a young age. Though he is kind, he is very confident in his and his team's skills, claiming not to see Team Otori as threats. He is childhood friends with Eigo Sawatari, and they were often called "Princess" and "Knight".

;{{nihongo|Eigo Sawatari|申渡 栄吾|Sawatari Eigo}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yuuma Uchida]]}}
:Sawatari is the serious and mature member of Team Hiragi who attended the same middle school as Tsukigami and Nayuki. He is good at observing and analyzing music. He is childhood friends with Rui Tatsumi, and they were often called "Princess" and "Knight".

;{{nihongo|Akira Ugawa|卯川 晶|Ugawa Akira}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]}}
:Contrary to his angelic appearance, Ugawa is Team Hiragi's little devil. His bratty personality often causes him to clash with Tengenji and Tsukigami, but he listens to Tatsumi whenever he asks him to stop. However, according to Team Hiragi, he's not really a bad guy even though he has a bad mouth.

;{{nihongo|Izumi Toraishi|虎石 和泉|Toraishi Izumi}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kenn (Japanese actor)|KENN]]}}
:Toraishi is the fashionable and flirty member of Team Hiragi. With a handsome face, he is very popular among women, even taking them out using Kuga's motorcycle. Though he resembles a delinquent, he is actually a caring guy. He is childhood friends with Kuga.

;{{nihongo|Seishiro Inumine|戌峰 誠士郎|Inumine Seishirō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]}}
:Similar to Hoshitani, the bright and friendly Inumine is Team Hiragi's mood maker. Though he is an airhead and a bit idiotic at times, he has a natural talent for music and a well-toned body. He often sings out of nowhere. His family runs a Chinese restaurant.

===Team Yuzuriha===
;{{nihongo|Riku Ageha|揚羽 陸|Ageha Riku}}
:{{voiced by|[[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]}}

;{{nihongo|So Hachiya|蜂矢 聡|Hachiya Sō}}
:{{voiced by|Kengo Takanashi}}

===Team Sazanami===
;{{nihongo|Ren Kitahara|北原 廉|Kitahara Ren}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yūichirō Umehara]]}}

;{{nihongo|Koki Nanjo|南條 聖|Nanjō Kōki}}
:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]}}

===Kao Council===
;{{nihongo|Itsuki Otori|鳳 樹|Ōtori Itsuki}}
:{{voiced by|[[Junichi Suwabe]]}}
:An elite born into the branch family of Ayanagi Academy's chairman clan, but has no care for status or glory. With the reason of "they look interesting", he picks up Hoshitani and the other four during the musical department auditions. Adept at hiding his true feelings, so everyone around him think of him as a "strange senpai". His skills are top notch. A genius and a nonconformist.

;{{nihongo|Tsubasa Hiragi|柊 翼|Hīragi Tsubasa}}
:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Hirakawa]]}}
:Heir to the Hiragi clan, who have been chairmen for Ayanagi Academy. As the top student in the musical department, he feels it is his job to extract the talented starts bearing the Ayanagi brand. So serious that he is not accommodating at all. Acknowledges Otori's talent more than anyone else, and feels that he has more talent than even himself, so he worked behind the scenes to have Otori enter Kao Student Council. He is livid concerning Otori's unprecedented acts that can jeopardize the position including adding Hoshitani et al into the star slots.

;{{nihongo|Kyoji Akatsuki|暁 鏡司|Akatsuki Kyōji}}
:{{voiced by|[[Showtaro Morikubo]]}}
:Confident that no one knows more about the school's policies than he does, Akatsuki cannot forgive anything that disgraces Ayanagi Academy's traditions or taint Hiragi's name. He has a bad temper and isn't bothered by this as he sees no reason to go out of his way to be polite. Akatsuki holds a grudge against Otori for what he did to Hiragi years before.

;{{nihongo|Lion Christian Yuzuriha|楪゠クリスチアン゠リオン|Yuzuriha Kurisuchian Rion}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kōsuke Toriumi]]}}
:Flamboyant and energetic, Yuzuriha is the mood maker of the Kao Council. Compared to the other members, he acts a bit more childish but still takes his duties as a member of the Kao Council seriously. He was born in France but moved to Japan before starting school at Ayanagi Academy.

;{{nihongo|Sakuya Sazanami|漣 朔也|Sazanami Sakuya}}

[[File:Cptvdisplay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Flat-screen televisions for sale at a consumer electronics store in 2008.]]
'''Television''' ('''TV'''), sometimes shortened to '''tele''' or '''telly''', is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in [[monochrome]] ([[black and white]]), or in colour, and in two or [[3D television|three dimensions]] and sound. The term can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] ("TV show"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]] for advertising, entertainment and news.  

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] tape, [[Hard disk drive|local disks]], DVDs, [[flash drives]], high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, and cloud [[digital video recorders]] has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on [[Cloud computing|the cloud]].  At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].

In 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), [[OLED]] displays, and [[plasma display]]s was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="cepro.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|author=Julie Jacobson|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs|author=Marshall Honorof|work=Tom's Guide|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/lg-electronics-expects-oled-tv-market-gradually-replace-led-tv-market|title=LG Electronics expects the OLED TV market to gradually replace the LED TV market|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new Smart TVs run on Android TV|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart TV]]s with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/internet-tv-and-the-death-of-cable-tv-really/ |title=Internet TV and The Death of Cable TV, really |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals, but a [[Digital television transition|transition]] to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.

==Etymology==
The word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''τῆλε'' (tèle)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over [[telegraph]] or telephone wires".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=30 December 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The abbreviation "TV" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean "a television set" dates from 1941.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The use of the term to mean "television as a medium" dates from 1927.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The slang term "telly" is more common in the UK. The slang term "the tube" or the "boob tube" refers to the bulky [[cathode ray tube]] used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is "idiot box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thompson, Robert|title=1985: Television Transformed 1.0|work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 October 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/media/1985-television-transformed-1-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the United States, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"&gt;Johnson, Richard (2018).

Retrieved November 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The “small screen”, as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the “[[Feature film|big screen]]” was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"/&gt;

[[Facsimile transmission]] systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. [[Alexander Bain]] introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. [[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 13, 22. {{ISBN|978-0-8240-7782-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word  ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constantin PERSKYI|url=https://www.histv.net/perskyi-1900|title=Télévision au moyen de l'électricité|agency=Congrès Inographs by Telegraph|work=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=20 September 1907|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Arthur Korn]], among others, made the design practical.&lt;ref name="Sending Photographs by Telegraph"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E4DA1331E733A25757C2A9649C946697D6CF "Sending Photographs by Telegraph"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, 20 September 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision à distance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

[[File:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Baird in 1925 with his televisor equipment and dummies "James" and "Stooky Bill" ''(right)''.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505–506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].

In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Pathé]] established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41–45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]], then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television". Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Léon Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/rca_story_brewster.html | title=Early Electronic Television RCA TV Development: 1929 – 1949 | publisher=Early Television Museum | accessdate=20 February 2016 | author=Brewster, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in [[Shizuoka University]], Hamamatsu Campus. His research in creating a production model was halted by the United States after Japan lost [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp"&gt;[http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101180643/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ |date=1 January 2016 }}, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissectors]] and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, English [[physicist]] [[J. J. Thomson]] was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the "Braun" tube.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]], with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1908 [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he described how "distant electric vision" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device,&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.&lt;ref name="sfmuseum"/&gt; In 1929, the system was improved further by the elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422211543/http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0648.xml/complete The Philo T. and Elma G.

[[File:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application;&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1&amp;nbsp;million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel, ''The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television'', Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243–244. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0759-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

American television broadcasting, at the time, consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941.&lt;ref name="Everson4"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, 1 December 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C.

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, "Color Television", [http://www.google.com/patents?id=7pNDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=color+television&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1936&amp;as_maxm_ap=12&amp;as_maxy_ap=1941&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007 U.S. Patent 2,480,571], filed 7 September 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was first demonstrated to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;Current Broadcasting 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColorTVSuccess&gt;"Color Television Success in Test", ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1940, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''The New York Times'', 5 September 1940, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=JScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color]", ''Popular Science'', December 1940, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November.&lt;ref name="ColorTVSuccess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "CBS Demonstrates Full Color Television," ''Wall Street Journal'', 5 September 1940, p. 1. "Television Hearing Set," ''New York Times'', 13 November 1940, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] "compatible". ("Compatible Color", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", of [[West Side Story]], 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE]]'s relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Due to [[data compression]] digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522191336/http://www.disabled%2Dworld.com/artman/publish/digital%2Dhdtv.shtml | archivedate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese [[consumer electronics]] firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the [[consumer electronics]] industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the [[computer industry]] (joined by the [[film industry]] and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816184950/http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2009 |title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html|title=What's the Difference between "Interlaced" and "Progressive" Video? – ISF Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"/&gt;

[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access.

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) or with [[Web TV]]. [[Internet television]] refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems – terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

3D television conveys [[depth perception]] to the viewer by employing techniques such as [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] display, [[free viewpoint television|multi-view]] display, [[2D-plus-depth]], or any other form of [[3D display]]. Most modern 3D [[television set]]s use an [[active shutter 3D system]] or a [[polarized 3D system]], and some are [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045734/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html| archivedate= 19 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. Many 3D television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.According to DisplaySearch 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45&amp;nbsp;million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3D TV-sales growth |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |newspaper=globalpost.com |date=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724082049/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future looks flat for 3D TV|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/future-looks-flat-for-3d-tv-20130814-2rv1q.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is 3D TV dead?

[[File:UHF TV Antenna 001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A modern high gain UHF Yagi [[television antenna]]. It has 17 directors, and one reflector (made of 4 rods) shaped as a [[corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]].]]
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by television stations, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177–179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104116/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 |date=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160139/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for [[cord cutters]]. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.

===Cable television===

[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coaxial cable]] is used to carry cable television signals into cathode ray tube and flat panel television sets.]]
Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Satellite television===
{{main article|Satellite television}}

[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|DBS satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex.]]
Satellite television is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using broadcast signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet television===
{{main article|Streaming television}}
{{Distinguish|Smart television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}

Internet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the [[digital distribution]] of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or "telly", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]], which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use [[LED-backlit LCD display|LEDs]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology – The Source for Critical Information and Insight. – IHS Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

====CRT====
{{main article|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A 14-inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns]]
The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a [[vacuum tube]] containing one or more [[electron gun]]s (a source of [[electrons]] or electron emitter) and a [[fluorescent]] screen used to view images.&lt;ref name="crthistory"/&gt;
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

In television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of [[video projector]] technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded [[Emmy Awards]] in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of [[digital cinema]] projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221025534/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2014|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma====
{{main article|Plasma display}}

A [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called "[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

====LCD====
{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}
[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]
Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.

====OLED====
{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}
[[File:LG전자, 깜빡임 없는 55인치 3D OLED TV 공개(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]]. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display resolution===
[[File:8K UHD, 5K, 4K UHD, FHD and SD.svg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Comparison of 8K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], 4K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], [[High-definition television|HDTV]] and [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolution]]

====LD====
{{main article|Low-definition television}}

Low-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).

====SD====
{{main article|Standard-definition television}}

Standard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html|title=Digital Television|date=28 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.

====HD====
{{main article|High-definition television}}

High-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:
* [[1080p]]: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
* [[1080i]]: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;
* [[720p]]: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame

====UHD====
{{main article|Ultra-high-definition television}}

Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or [[XVGA#UHD (4K) (3840×2160)|UHD]]) includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] (2160p) and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]] (4320p), which are two [[digital video]] formats proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU). The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] announced on 17 October 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/what-is-ultra-hdtv/ | title = What is Ultra HDTV? | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-4k-and-8k-ultra-hd/ | title = The Ultimate Guide to 4K Ultra HD | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market share===
North American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. {{asof|2011}}, 48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of {{convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="martin20111227"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/business/tv-prices-fall-squeezing-most-makers-and-sellers.html | title=Plummeting TV Prices Squeeze Makers and Sellers | work=The New York Times | date=27 December 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2011 | author=Martin, Andrew | pages=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
{{See also|Television show}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

# Original run or First run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.
# [[Broadcast syndication]]: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, TV stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].

===Genres===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  "[[quality television]]", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are "quality television", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.

]]

Around the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2&amp;nbsp;million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9&amp;nbsp;billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 – Markets, Trends Facts &amp; Figures (2008–2013)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008–09)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
{{main article|Television advertisement}}

TV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") to fund their programming.&lt;ref name="Hornick"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917000611/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml |date=17 September 2010 }} "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.

[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]

The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a "daypart"). In many countries, including the United States, television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.

The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, 6 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNBT/Bulova test pattern|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:コマーシャルメッセージ|コマーシャルメッセージ (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 24 November 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
Since inception in the US in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940–1949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200852/http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &amp;#124; Quiz Show Scandal &amp;#124; People &amp; Events &amp;#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.

US advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
Broadcast advertising is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/General-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf General Commercial Communications Code] and [http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Childrens-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf Children’s Commercial Communications Code], referenced in: {{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/index.php/2010/05/bai-launches-revised-broadcasting-codes/|title=BAI launches Revised Broadcasting Codes|date=May 2010|publisher=Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2016}};&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* [[Belgium]] ([[RTBF]])
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
* Ireland ([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* [[Norway]] ([[NRK]])
* [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])

The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8&amp;nbsp;million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Licence types and costs|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

Other than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/abc-spent-nearly-50m-on-redundancy-payouts-after-coalition-budget-cuts-hit | title=ABC spent nearly $50m on redundancy payouts after Coalition budget cuts hit | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |受信料|Jushinryō}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

===Broadcast programming===
{{main|Broadcast programming}}
{{see also|TV listings (UK)}}
Broadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.

==Social aspects==
{{Main article|Social aspects of television}}
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|American family watching television, circa 1958]]
Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  "Imaginary Friends." ''Scientific American''. 28 July 2009.  Web.  26 March 2010.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=imaginary-friends&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many advantages. The article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2006|title=The Good Things About Television|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

===Consumption===
{{main|Television consumption}}

==Negative impacts==
With high lead content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=3 July 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828072528/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''[[The Journal of Human Resources]]'' found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernæs, Ø., Markussen, S., Røed, K. 2017. Television, Cognitive Ability, and High School Completion. J. Human Resources. doi: 10.3368/jhr.54.2.0316.7819R1. http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2017/10/02/jhr.54.2.0316.7819R1.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Incredibles''''' is an American [[media franchise]] created by Pixar Animation Studios. [[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed both films, and [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] are part of the cast. The first film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was released in November 2004 and received acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The second film, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released in June 2018, received mostly positive reviews and set the record for best opening weekend for an animated film with $183 million. The series has grossed a combined $1.873 billion worldwide.

==Films==

===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===
{{main|The Incredibles}}
A family of superheroes, while trying to live a quiet suburban life after superheroes are deemed illegal, are forced into action to save the world.

===''Incredibles 2'' (2018)===
{{main|Incredibles 2}}
In an effort to reinstate the public's trust in superheroes, Helen (Elastigirl) is chosen by a telecommunications corporation to pull off a publicity stunt while her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for their kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack.

===Future films===
Following the release of ''Incredibles 2'', director [[Brad Bird]] acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story (franchise)#Toy Story 4|Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird’s film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. "There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else."&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles. "I wouldn't ever rule it out," said producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] of a potential third film. "And if past is prologue, it'll be another 14 years — and a lot of people will probably need oxygen to make a third one."&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/|title=Could there be an Incredibles 3? Director Brad Bird weighs in|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Snetiker|first=Marc|date=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==
===''Jack-Jack Attack'' (2005)===
{{Main article|Jack-Jack Attack}}
A short film was released on March 15, 2005 on the first film's DVD release, entitled ''Jack-Jack Attack.'' Bird returned to write and direct the short. It was originally conceived to be part of the first film, but decided to make it into a short. The short takes place during the events of the first film and follows Kari as she babysits Jack-Jack while discovering his newly awakened superpowers in the process.

===''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' (2005)===
{{main article|Mr. Incredible and Pals}}
Another short film titled ''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' was also included on the first film's DVD release. The short is a fictional episode of a low-budget 1960s animated series in the style of ''[[Clutch Cargo]].'' It follows Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and their rabbit pal Mister Skipperdoo's attempt to prevent a bridge from being destroyed. [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] appear in character as Mr. Incredible and Frozone respectively in the short's commentary track.

===''Auntie Edna'' (2018)===

A short film entitled '' Auntie Edna'' was released on October 23, 2018 included with the digital release of ''Incredibles 2''  and on November 6, 2018 with the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. In a similar manner to ''Jack-Jack Attack'', the short follows Edna during the events of ''Incredibles 2'' as she babysits Jack-Jack while coping with his newly discovered powers.

==Video games==
===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===
{{main|The Incredibles (video game)}}
A video game developed by [[Heavy Iron Studios]] and published by [[THQ]] based on the [[The Incredibles|2004 film]] was released on October 31, 2004 for [[PlayStation 2]], [[mobile phone]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].

===''The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer'' (2005)===
 {{main|The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer}}
A video game presented as a direct continuation of ''The Incredibles'' (until ''Incredibles 2'' rendered it non-canon), released in October 24, 2005 for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Xbox, once again developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ. The game takes place after the events of the film and follows Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they face off against the Underminer as he prepares his attack on the Earth's surface.

===''Lego The Incredibles'' (2018)===
{{main|Lego The Incredibles}}
A [[Lego]] video game adaptation based on the events of the first two films was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] on June 15, 2018 for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] coinciding with the release of ''Incredibles 2''.

===Other miscellaneous titles===
''The Incredibles'' have made appearances in other Disney-related video games, including [[The Incredibles: When Danger Calls]],
A PC game featuring several minigames released in 2004. They also appeared in all three ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' games in which characters from the films appear as playable characters, with [[Disney Infinity (video game)|the first game]] featuring a play set based on the franchise, and ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney–Pixar Adventure]]'' for [[Xbox 360]], Xbox One, and [[Windows 10]], which includes missions from various Pixar films including ''The Incredibles''.

==Production==
===Production for the first film===
''The Incredibles'' as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during a period in which he tried to break into film.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"&gt;
{{cite video| people = Brad Bird, John Walker | title =The Incredibles. Special Features: Making of The Incredibles | medium = [[Blu-ray Disc]]| publisher = Buena Vista Home Entertainment |year = 2011 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGNint&gt;{{cite news|last=Patrizio|first=Andy|title=An Interview with Brad Bird|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird|accessdate=July 27, 2013|newspaper=IGN|date=March 9, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195157/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird|archivedate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; During this time, Bird had inked a production deal with [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and was in the process of directing his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"/&gt; Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; He stated, "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie."&lt;ref&gt;Paik, Karen. (2007) ''To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios,'' Chronicle Books LLC, pg. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; After the box office failure of ''The Iron Giant'', Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"&gt;Price, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"&gt;Price, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a [[Traditional animation#Cels|2D cel animation]].&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; When ''The Iron Giant'' became a [[box office bomb]], he reconnected with old friend [[John Lasseter]] at [[Pixar]] in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him.&lt;ref name="IGNint"/&gt; Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"/&gt; Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in [[computer animation]]. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000,&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. ''The Incredibles'' was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch06"&gt;Price, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it would be the company's first film in which all characters are human.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"&gt;Price, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="The dad is always expected in the family to be strong, so I made him strong. The moms are always pulled in a million different directions, so I made her stretch like taffy.

Babies are unrealized potential."|source=–&amp;nbsp;Brad Bird, writer and director of ''The Incredibles''.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch05"&gt;Price, p. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Bird/Bird_Interview.htm|title=Brad Bird - Interview|publisher=MichaelBarrier.com|date=February 27, 2005|accessdate=July 31, 2012|author=[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Production for the second film=== 
Following the first film, [[Brad Bird]] directed his next film for Pixar, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to ''The Incredibles'', but only if it could be even better than the original. He stated, "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21218 | title=Bird on Toy Story 3 and The Incredibles 2 | date=June 22, 2007 | accessdate=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world." He added: "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another ''Incredibles'' film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/brad-bird-incredibles-sequel-i-523427 | title=Brad Bird on 'Incredibles' Sequel: 'I Would Probably Wanna Do That' (Q&amp;A) | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=May 16, 2013 | accessdate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers yet known by the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/la-et-me-incredibles-2-premiere-20180606-story.html | title = 'Incredibles 2' team on the sequel's 14-year gap, and putting Elastigirl center stage | first = Christina | last = Schoellkopf | date = June 7, 2018 | accessdate = June 8, 2018 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pixar announced in November 2016 that both [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] would return to reprise their roles,&lt;ref name=THRHunterAlanBall&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Holly Hunter to Star in HBO's Alan Ball Family Drama|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/holly-hunter-star-hbos-alan-ball-family-drama-948295|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date= November 17, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EWJacksonImage&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Nick|title=Incredibles 2: Samuel L.

'''''The Magic School Bus''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]] [[media franchise]] that consists of [[The Magic School Bus (book series)|a book series]], [[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|a TV series]], and [[The Magic School Bus (video games)|several video games]], among other things. Each of the stories within the franchise centers on the antics of a fictional [[elementary school]] [[teacher]], Ms. Frizzle, and her class, who board a "magic [[school bus]]", which takes them on field trips to unusual locations, such as the solar system, clouds, the [[Time travel|past]], and inside the human body.

== History ==
The first media in which this franchise was developed was [[The Magic School Bus (book series)|the ''Magic School Bus'' book series]]. Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and [[Joanna Cole (author)|Joanna Cole]] (who had written both science and humor before) and [[Bruce Degen]] were then approached with creating such a series. Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once, served as further inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/2947-two-decades-of-fun-and-learning-on-the-magic-school-bus.html |title=Two Decades of Fun and Learning on the Magic School Bus |accessdate=2012-10-03 |last=Lodge |first=Sally |date=2006-07-27 |work=Publisher’s Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book "At the Waterworks" was written in 1985 and published the following year. The books are written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] from the point of view of an unnamed student in "the Friz's" class. Cole and Degen started a new series called ''Ms. Frizzle's Adventures'' in 2001, which teaches [[social studies]], eventually producing three books in that series. [[Microsoft Home]] started publishing ''Magic School Bus'' software in 1994.

In 1994, ''The Magic School Bus'' concept was also made into [[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|an animated series of the same name]] by [[Scholastic Entertainment]], and premiered on September 10, 1994. Scholastic Entertainment president Deborah Forte says that adapting the books into an animated series was an opportunity to help kids "learn about science in a fun way".&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarke |first=Melanie M. |date=2005-06-20 |title=A Scholastic Achievement |journal=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |volume=135 |issue=25 |pages=30 |publisher=Cahners Publishing Co./Reed Publishing (USA) Inc. |location= |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Forte had been hearing concern from parents and teachers about how to improve science education for girls and minorities.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; As noted by Marcel LaFollette, "accomplished women were exceptions in a universe of male luminaries" when it came to science television.&lt;ref name=LaFollette2013/&gt;{{rp|185}} Miss Valerie Frizzle, the magic school teacher, was the closest approximation to an expert female host.&lt;ref name=Halpern&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halpern|first1=Paul|title=On the Air|journal=Distillations|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation | date=2015|volume=1|issue=2|page=44|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/on-the-air|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaFollette2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaFollette|first1=Marcel Chotkowski|title=Science on American television : a history|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|chapter=Rarae Aves: Television's Female Scientists|pp=185-195|isbn=978-0-226-92199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183, 185–195}} She was voiced by [[Lily Tomlin]] in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005499/|title=Lily Tomlin|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each episode of the series ran for 30 minutes. In the United States, the series originally aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] as a part of its children's block, PTV (later renamed [[PBS Kids]]), through [[South Carolina]]'s [[South Carolina Educational Television|SCETV]] network; it was the first fully animated series to be aired on PBS. The last episode aired on December 6, 1997; the series then aired reruns on PBS until September 1998. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network aired repeats from September 1998 to September 2002. Starting September 27, 2010, ''The Magic School Bus'' started a daily run on [[Qubo]] in the US, and on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] through June 30th, 2012, when the [[Qubo]] block was replaced with the [[NBC Kids]] block.

From 1994 to 2000, several [[The Magic School Bus (video games)|''Magic School Bus'' video games]] were released. Most of the original titles were created by the software company [[Music Pen]] in collaboration with [[Microsoft]] and [[Scholastic Press]], the publisher of the ''Magic School Bus'' book series. Though in the cartoon series, the bus was obviously animated in the usual way, in the [[CD-ROM]] games, it is typically animated with [[computer generated imagery]]. In all these titles the user gets to "drive" the bus, which almost always involves clicking on the [[steering wheel]] and choosing a location. (The exception is ''The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth'' where it is the gear shift instead of the steering wheel.) Most of the games have about seven different locations, including the classroom. There is always some goal for the user in each one.

[[Scholastic Entertainment]], the [[American Meteorological Society]] and the [[Children's Museum of Houston]] created a ''Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm'', a {{convert|2600|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. traveling exhibit funded in part by the [[National Science Foundation]], which premiered at the Children's Museum of Houston in 2003 (a copy of it opened in [[New Jersey]] the month after that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/84Annual/techprogram/paper_66953.htm |title=Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm Museum Exhibit |accessdate=2009-03-23 |last=McCallum |first=Cheryl D. |author2= L. Nazarani |author3=The Children's Museum of Houston |date=2007-01-04 |work=ams.confex.com |publisher=American Meteorological Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2017, Scholastic and [[Netflix]] released the reboot animated series ''[[The Magic School Bus Rides Again]]'', with [[Kate McKinnon]] as the voice of Ms. Frizzle's sister, Fiona Felicity Frizzle, who is now in charge of the class. [[Lily Tomlin]] also reprises her role as Ms. Frizzle, now Professor Frizzle, Ph.D.

'''''The Matrix''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise]] created by [[The Wachowski Brothers]]&lt;!--Credited as "The Wachowski Brothers". Do not change without consensus. See [[Talk:The Matrix#"The Wachowskis" vs "The Wachowski Brothers"]]. --&gt;, about heroes who fight a desperate war against machine overlords that have enslaved humanity in an extremely sophisticated [[virtual reality]] system. The series is most notable for its two uses of slow motion, which revolutionized action films to come. 

The series began with the feature film ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), and continued with two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (both 2003), all written and directed by The Wachowskis and produced by [[Joel Silver]]. The franchise is owned by [[Warner Bros.]], which distributed the films along with [[Village Roadshow Pictures]]. The latter, along with [[Silver Pictures]] are the two production companies that worked on all three films.

The first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning four [[Academy Awards]], introducing [[popular culture]] symbols such as the [[red pill and blue pill]], and [[The Matrix#Legacy|influencing action filmmaking]]. For those reasons it has been added to the [[National Film Registry]] for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing - National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first sequel was an even bigger commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Matrix Revolutions Ignites Global Box Office Revolution with $204 Million Opening, Setting a New Record for the Biggest Consecutive 5-Day Opening of All Time {{!}} WarnerMedia|url=http://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2003/11/09/the-matrix-revolutions-ignites-global-box-office-revolution-with|website=www.warnermediagroup.com|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Looking back at the Matrix sequels|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/the-matrix/30733/looking-back-at-the-matrix-sequels|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which it held for 13 years, until it was surpassed by the film [[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=‘Deadpool’ Overtakes ‘Matrix Reloaded’ as Highest-Grossing R-Rated Movie|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/deadpool-box-office-biggest-r-rated-movie-1201740907/|work=Variety|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|first=Brent|last=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features a [[cyberpunk]] story of the technological fall of man, in which a self-aware artificial intelligence has wiped most of humanity from the Earth except for those it enslaves in a virtual reality system as a farmed power source, and the relatively few remaining humans who are free of that system. The A.I. agenda is to destroy all humans who are free, considering them a threat/disease.  The story incorporates references to numerous philosophical and religious ideas. Influences include the principles of [[mythology]], [[anime]], and [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] (particularly "[[heroic bloodshed]]" and [[martial arts film|martial arts]] movies). Consistent throughout are the concepts of inter-dependency and love.

The characters and settings of the films are further explored in other media set in the same [[fictional universe]], including animation, comics, and video games. The comic "Bits and Pieces of Information" and ''[[The Animatrix]]'' short film [[The Animatrix#.22The Second Renaissance Part I.22|"The Second Renaissance"]] act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise's setting came to be. The video game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' connects the story of the ''Animatrix'' short [[The Animatrix#"Final Flight of the Osiris"|"Final Flight of the Osiris"]] with the events of ''Reloaded'', while the video game ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' is a direct sequel to ''Revolutions''.

As of February 2016, the franchise has generated $3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue, making it one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramascreen.com/international-buyers-put-blooms-suburbicon-on-the-map-paramount-pictures-acquires-the-u-s-rights/|title=International Buyers Put BLOOM’s "Suburbicon" On The Map. Paramount Pictures Acquires The U.S. Rights|website=ramascreen.com|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, it was reported that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with new films.

==Setting==
The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by artificial intelligence that was created early in the 21st century and [[AI takeover|rebelled against humanity]]. At one point, humans attempted to block out the machines' source of [[solar power]] by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. During this time, the machines and mankind were engaged in a massive war in which the machines ultimately emerged the victor. Having no definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract humans' [[bioelectricity]] and [[thermal energy]] by growing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by [[cybernetic implant]]s connecting them to a [[simulated reality]] called the Matrix.

The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the stories in the ''Matrix'' franchise take place in a vast [[Western World]] unnamed megacity. This environment is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the majority of bluepills - humans connected to the Matrix - are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain [[superhuman]] abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual [[physical law]]s.

The virtual world is first introduced in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' short film "[[The Second Renaissance]]" and the short comic ''Bits and Pieces of Information'' show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

The ''Matrix'' series includes a trilogy of feature films, all of which were written and directed by [[The Wachowskis]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]], starring [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. The series was filmed in [[Australia]] and began with 1999's ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicts the recruitment of hacker [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] into humanity's rebellion against sentient machines. The film was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide, and becoming the first DVD release in the United States to reach sales of three million copies.&lt;ref name="dvdsales"&gt;''{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305104849/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archivedate=March 5, 2008|title=Press release – August 1, 2000 – The Matrix DVD: The first to sell 3 million|publisher=Warner Bros., Inc.|work=Whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com|location=Burbank|date=August 1, 2000|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/reeves-helmers-near-pricey-matrix-sequels-1117750684/|title=Reeves, helmers near pricey ‘Matrix’ sequels|first=Michael|last=Fleming|date=August 24, 1999|work=variety.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', were filmed simultaneously during one [[filmmaking#Production|shoot]] (under the project codename "The Burly Man"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html|title=MATRIX2|first=Steve|last=Silberman|work=wired.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in two parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and visual effects.

=== Future ===
While making the ''Matrix'' films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another one after ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=107|title=Don Davis - Interview|work=soundtrack.net|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052591672027.html|title=Love bug bites the new Matrix - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/11/14/next-neo-thing/amp/|title=Next Neo Thing|date=November 14, 2003|work=ew.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailyhaggis.com/2003/10/28/new-matrix-games-on-the-way/&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, in interviews promoting ''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'', Lilly Wachowski called a return to ''The Matrix'' a "particularly repelling idea in these times", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/wachowskis-unfazed-by-negativity-ahead-of-jupiter-ascending-launch-1.1751638|title=Wachowskis unfazed by negativity ahead of 'Jupiter Ascending' launch|first=Derrik J.|last=Lang|work=timescolonist.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], said they haven't heard anything, but she believed the studio might be looking to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-interview/|title=The Wachowskis Talk JUPITER ASCENDING, Creating the Chicago Sequence, SENSE8, and More|date=February 4, 2015|work=collider.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with [[Zak Penn]] in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting [[Michael B. Jordan]] attached to star. According to the article neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved at that stage, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/matrix-reboot-works-at-warner-bros-986292|title='The Matrix' Reboot in the Works at Warner Bros. (Exclusive)|work=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn struck down the notion of a reboot or [[remake]], stating he is interested in seeing stories set in the already established universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-matrix-reboot-details-zak-penn/|title=‘The Matrix’ Reboot Writer Says It May Not Be a Reboot After All|date=March 17, 2017|work=collider.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, one such story the studio is considering, is a [[prequel]] film about a young [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/03/17/the-new-matrix-may-be-a-young-morpheus-movie|title=The New MATRIX May Be A Young Morpheus Movie|first=Scott|last=Wampler|date=March 17, 2017|work=birthmoviesdeath.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous month, Keanu Reeves said he would return to a potential new ''Matrix'' film only if the Wachowskis were writing and directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/keanu-reeves-is-up-for-the-matrix-4-exclusive-135415356.html|title=Keanu Reeves is up for The Matrix 4 (exclusive)|work=yahoo.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Hugo Weaving said he would be open to returning in future Matrix films if the scripts were good and came with the Wachowskis' blessing, although he believed the producers would likely want a fresh start with a new cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/18/hugo-weaving-on-revisiting-the-matrix-they-would-start-again-with-different-actors|title=Hugo Weaving on revisiting The Matrix: 'They would start again with different actors'|first=Luke|last=Buckmaster|date=April 17, 2017|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Penn said he is working on a revival of the franchise and teased the possibility of an expanded universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joey|last=Paur|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/the-writer-of-the-matrix-revival-offers-an-update-and-teases-an-expanded-universe|title=The Writer of THE MATRIX Revival Offers an Update and Teases an Expanded Universe|date=19 March 2018|publisher=GeekTyrant|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' ==
In 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'', a ten-disc set of the films on [[DVD]]. It included all three films, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film ''[[The Matrix Revisited]]'', the live action footage shot for ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', and a promotional compilation of ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. For this release, ''The Matrix'' was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and Bill Pope to improve its picture quality and make its coloring closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not, with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form their own opinion. A ''Limited Edition'' of ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was also released. It encases the ten discs plus a [[resin]] bust of Neo inside an [[acrylic glass]] box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13432/ultimate-matrix-collection-limited-edition-the/|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection: Limited Edition|work=dvdtalk.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was later also released on [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras the original standalone DVD releases of the films had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/301/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection HD DVD Review - High-Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray release presented ''The Animatrix'' in high definition for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/300/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection Blu-ray Review - High Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and public response===

While ''The Matrix'' received largely positive reviews, and ''The Matrix Reloaded'' received generally positive reviews,&lt;ref name="rt-matrix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt-reloaded"/&gt; the critical response to ''The Matrix Revolutions'' was mixed.&lt;ref name="rt-revolutions" /&gt; One major complaint was that it did not give any answers to the questions raised in ''Reloaded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/n_9482/index1.html|title=Naval Gazing|work=nymag.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the series an average grade of "A−", "B+", "B" respectively on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Mcs" /&gt;

And we were like, 'Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?'&lt;br&gt;So the first movie is sort of typical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like 'Stop attacking me!' in the same way that people get upset with [[deconstruction|deconstructionist philosophy]]. I mean, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning.}}

The ''Matrix'' films makes numerous references to films and literature, and to historical myths and philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], [[obscurantism]], and [[nihilism]]. The films' premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the first film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |date=October 21, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARoKJ00cEZ8|title=Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski|first=|last=DePaul Visiting Artists Series|date=May 2, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017|via=YouTube| time=01:11:34}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similarities to [[cyberpunk]] works such as ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]],&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/postmodernism/plans/postmodplansmatrix.html|title=Postmodernism Lesson Plans: The Matrix and Neuromancer|work=purdue.edu|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has described ''The Matrix'' as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_01_28_archive.asp#90244012|title=THE MATRIX: FAIR COP|authorlink=William Gibson|last=Gibson|first=William|work=The William Gibson Blog|date=January 28, 2003|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html|title=Home|work=warnervideo.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Joel Silver]] has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for ''The Matrix'' by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real."&lt;ref name="silver-anime-1"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Scrolls to Screen: A Brief History of Anime" featurette on ''[[The Animatrix]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silver-anime-2"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Making ''The Matrix''" featurette on the ''Matrix'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]] of [[Production I.G]], which produced ''Ghost in the Shell'', noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since ''Ghost in the Shell'' had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a "promotional tool."&lt;ref name="south bank show"&gt;[[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]], interviewed in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', episode broadcast February 19, 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100528022243/http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=2701]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities to the 1985 anime film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis claimed to have never seen it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |title=ONLINE CHAT - Larry &amp; Andy Wachowski |date=February 13, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213041503/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have commented on similarities between ''The Matrix'' and other late-1990s films such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', and ''[[The Truman Show]]''.&lt;ref name="rogerebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990331/REVIEWS/903310303/1023|title=The Matrix|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times|suntimes.com]]|quote="The Matrix" recycles the premises of "Dark City" and "Strange Days,"...|date=March 31, 1999|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=105863|title=The Matrix (1999) - Film Review from FilmFour|work=[[Film4]]|publisher=[[Channel Four Television Corporation]]|quote=The film is a perfect product of its time. It is a very modern conspiracy thriller, a film based, like The Truman Show, on the appealingly terrifying notion of a universal conspiracy - that life itself and everything that we know and take for granted are lies. It's also a film steeped in the traditionals of Japanese anime and megamixed philosophy and semiotics (spot the Baudrillard references kids).|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525142638/http://www.film4.com/reviews/1999/the-matrix|archivedate=May 25, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rowley review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sterow.com/?p=229 |title=What Was the Matrix? |author=Rowley, Stephen |date=June 18, 2003|work=sterow.com|quote=The Matrix was the third in a cycle of movies to arrive in the late nineties with a strikingly similar theme. Like its predecessors from the previous year, Dark City and The Truman Show, it tells the story of a seemingly ordinary man who suddenly finds that his whole life is faked: he is trapped in an artificially created environment designed to keep him in submission. Like the heroes of those earlier movies, Keanu Reeves' Neo starts to realise that he is somehow special, and tries to escape the confines of his prison.|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis claimed no influence regarding ''Dark City'', but commented about it and ''The Truman Show'' that they thought it was "very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

Comparisons have also been made to [[Grant Morrison]]'s comic series ''[[The Invisibles]]''; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.&lt;ref name="grantmorrison"&gt;[http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html "Poor Mojo Newswire: Suicide Girls Interview with Grant Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628091125/http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html |date=June 28, 2009 }}." URL retrieved July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis have responded that they enjoy the comic but weren't inspired by it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

In addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has also been noted. As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Condon, Paul. ''The Matrix Unlocked''. 2003. Contender. p.141-3. {{ISBN|1-84357-093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Matrix'' film features numerous references to the "[[White Rabbit]]", the "Rabbit Hole" and mirrors, referring to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,22971,00.html|title=Popular Metaphysics|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=April 11, 1999|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/

[[Matrixism]] is a [[new religious movement]] inspired by the trilogy. A [[sociologist of religion]] [[Adam Possamai]] describes these types of religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of [[popular culture]] and their connection to the fluid [[social structures]] of [[late capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055343/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Theyre-all-god-movies/2005/05/18/1116361618786.html|title=They're all god movies, in mysterious ways - National - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080615/Mirror/mirror006.html|title=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|work=sundaytimes.lk|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Wachowskis' [[coming out]] as [[transgender women]] some years after the release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis transgender experiences. In this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes exploring one's own [[gender identity]], starting the transition and [[coming out]] as transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@BootlegGirl/bootlegging-the-matrix-ccb8d6442778|title=Bootlegging the Matrix: In Which Bootleg Girl Explains the Matrix Sequels|author=Dr. Eleanor A.

==Legal claims==
In April 2003 Sophia Stewart filed a legal [[complaint]] in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] alleging that the idea of ''[[The Matrix]]'' (and the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'')  were [[plagiarized]] from her own [[film treatment]] entitled "The Third Eye."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Madison|title=Inside The Billion Dollar Matrix Lawsuit, One of the Internet’s Most Pervasive Legends|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/22/inside-the-billion-dollar-matrix-lawsuit-one-of-the-internets-most-pervasive-hoaxes/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seewood|first1=Andre|title=Sophia Stewart: "The Matrix" Lawsuit – Conspiracy Or Hoax?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/12/sophia-stewart-the-matrix-lawsuit-conspiracy-or-hoax-149399/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005,&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Corey|title='Matrix' Lawsuit to Move Forward|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4664150|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart did not attend the hearing. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys "had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and the accused directors’ films." &lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Kemp|title=The Billion-Dollar Myth|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/31/magazine/tm-mothermatrix31|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of "Internet legend," with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire2"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sergio|title=Why Won’t That Story About Sophia Stewart And Her ‘Matrix’ Lawsuit Die?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/04/why-wont-that-story-about-sophia-stewart-and-her-matrix-lawsuit-die-136356/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophia Stewart Matrix Lawsuit|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/matrix.asp|website=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=8 Aug 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging that ideas for the sequels ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' came from a screenplay he wrote called ''The Immortals.'' In a [[summary judgement]] for the [[defendant]]s, Judge R. Gary Klausner stated "The basic premises of ''The Matrix Trilogy'' and ''The Immortals'' are so different that it would be unreasonable to find their plots substantially similar."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=Warner Bros.

===Animation===
{{Main|The Animatrix}}
In acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese [[anime]] on the ''Matrix'' series, ''[[The Animatrix]]'' was produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''. This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of ''The Animatrix'' project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the ''Matrix'' universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of [[Japanese animation]]. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with ''[[Dreamcatcher (2003 film)|Dreamcatcher]]'', one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''.

===Video games===
On May 15, 2003, the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' was released in North America concurrently with ''The Matrix Reloaded''. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/20/technology/from-projector-to-polygons-a-thin-line-between-film-and-joystick.html|title=A Thin Line Between Film And Joystick|date=February 20, 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more ''The Matrix'' video games were released in 2005. The [[MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' continued the story beyond ''The Matrix Revolutions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/19/the-matrix-online-4|title=The Matrix Online|first=Tom|last=McNamara|date=March 18, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'' allowed players to control Neo in scenes from the film trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/21/path-of-neo-the-matrix-interview|title=Path of Neo: The Matrix Interview|first=Jeremy|last=Dunham|date=July 21, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Matrix'' official website also provided several original [[Adobe Flash]]-based [[browser game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/23/the-matrix-revolutions |title=The Matrix Revolutions |date=22 March 2004 |website=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matrix Arcade|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com:80/cmp/rl_game_index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216102005/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/rl_game_index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 16, 2005|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=8 July 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
''The Matrix Comics'' is a set of comic books and [[short story|short stories]] based on the series and written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry; one of the comics was written by the Wachowskis and illustrated by the films' [[concept artist]] [[Geof Darrow]]. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the ''Matrix'' series' website;&lt;ref name=comics&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815230811/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/comics_new_front.html|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/comics_new_front.html|title=Comics|work=whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com|accessdate=April 11, 2012|archivedate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] volumes.

===Screensaver===
The ''Matrix'' official website provided a free [[screensaver]] for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, which simulates the falling "[[Matrix digital rain]]" of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1999/05/14/decoding-matrix/|title=Decoding ''The Matrix''|last=Essex|first=Andrew|date=May 14, 1999|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matrix official screensaver|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com:80/cmp/m1_screensaver_index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216102005/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/m1_screensaver_index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 16, 2005|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=8 July 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screensaver was reported to have a password security issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Matrix" Screensaver is insecure|url=http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/3G5PRRFPPS.html|last=Boyce|first=Nick|date=October 6, 1999|publisher=SecuriTeam|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Matrix digital rain" also inspired the creation of many unofficial screensavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saver the Moment: movie inspired screen savers|url=http://ew.com/article/2001/03/02/saver-moment-movie-inspired-screen-savers/|last=Podolsky|first=Erin|date=March 2, 2001|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pocket Book of Boners''''' is a book illustrated by  Theodor Seuss Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]), originally published as four separate books in 1931–32 by [[The Viking Press]].  In 1941, Readers' League of America compiled these four books and published the ''Pocket Book of Boners''.&lt;ref name="1941note"&gt;Hansen, Harry (7 August 1941). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19410807&amp;id=jXcbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b0wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1578,2787094 Craze for Boners Stages Comeback in Recent Book], ''The Pittsburgh Press'' (p. 29)&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the bestselling [[paperback]] books of [[World War II]], with 1.34 million copies in print by 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Kenneth C. |date=1984 |title=Two-Bit Culture: The Paperbacking of America |url= |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=79 |isbn=0-395-35535-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its writing, the term "boner" was commonly used to mean a silly mistake, without any sexual connotation.

''The Pocket Book of Boners'' contains 22 illustrations of [[wikt:boner|boner]]s by [[Dr. Seuss]].  The rest of the volume consists of short jokes and humorous observations with most being no more than four lines long, and is notable for its early examples of [[Dr. Seuss]]' illustration style.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

The first book was released in February 1931.  A short positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Dr. Seuss's illustrations as "hilarious."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;(March 1, 1931).

'''Theatre techniques''' are procedures that facilitate a successful presentation of a play. They also include any practices that advance and enhance the understanding the audience brings to the action and the acting by the cast
on stage.

==The playwright's craft==
Theatre technique is part of the [[playwright]]'s creative writing of drama, as a kind of [[mimesis]] rather than mere [[illusion]] or [[imitation]] of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.&lt;br&gt; Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of [[dialogue]] that makes the playwright's characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization.

The playwright's art also consists in the ability to convey to the audience the ideas that give essence to the drama within the frame of its structure. 
Finally, the feeling for the natural divisions of a play—including [[act (theater)|act]]s, [[scene (fiction)|scene]]s, and changes of place—its entries and exits, and the positioning of the [[cast member|cast]] are integral to playwriting technique.

One of the playwright’s functions is that concerned with [[adaptation]]s of existing traditional drama, such as [[Charles Marowitz]]’s [[collage]]s of ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'' and other re-interpretations of [[Shakespeare]]'s works, as well as [[Tom Stoppard]]’s approaches in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', ''[[Dogg's Hamlet]]'', and ''[[Cahoot's Macbeth]]''.

==The director’s craft==
The director these days is responsible for the actual production of a play, as opposed to earlier days when it was the producer who, at least in Britain until the 1950s, had this task. In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.

The director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. 
 
However, the playwright’s work is still reflected in the director’s [[Prompter (theatre)|prompt copy]], a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.

== Stage management and stagecraft ==
The [[stage manager]] has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director’s objectives and the perceptions of the [[stage designer]]s are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director’s visions being passed down to each [[actor]] and member of the [[running crew]]. They are also responsible for [[safety]] and running an orderly backstage area. They maintain the prompt book and the [[call board]], to which [[rehearsal]] schedule notes are affixed for the cast.

[[Stagecraft]] overall has to address the various shortcomings of the stage’s spatial and physical limitations. For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant [[Panorama|vista]]s, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as [[thunderstorm]]s or [[wind]]s, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the [[audience]] with much distinctiveness.

It is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.

*[[Theatrical scenery|Sets and sceneries]] have to be designed and created in the [[workshop]]. They include outdoor and indoor scenes, or special types of constructions, and must also usually achieve the appearance of depth and distance within the spatial limitations of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].
*[[Stage lighting]] has to be provided to set the moods and sensitivities of the play, and to permit the showing of the emotional charge in the face of the actors, possibly reinforcing the pallor or vividness of their faces.
*[[Costume design|Costumes]] have to typify characters from the moment they appear on stage and signify the period or the social milieu in which the characters are to be seen. They can also indicate the characters' circumstances (whether they should appear rich or poor) or even whether they should be seen as [[comedy|comic]] or [[tragedy|tragic]] personae.
*[[Sound design|Sound effect]]s have to convey natural phenomena, such as wind or storm. However, it is also their function to call forth moods and feelings the audience will recognise.
*[[Special effect]]s have to deliver the imitations of physical actions on stage, such as explosions, fireworks, fog, or even earthquakes that are often part of the story.
*'''Rigging''' is an important aspect that is not often visible. All sound and lighting features and their cabling and wiring have to be held in a safe position, above both the stage and the auditorium, and therefore require specialist temporary and permanent fittings to be installed.
*The [[technical director]], especially in larger theatres, has the responsibility of overseeing the rigging and construction of the stage scenery. They create working drawings from the scenic designer’s drawings in order to pass on the designs to the scene shop.

==Trends and movements==

===The three unities===
The ''[[Classical unities]]'' of time, action and place were the main principles of French [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] [[drama]] during part of the 17th century.&lt;br&gt;They were introduced by [[Jean Mairet]] after a misreading of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'', and the critic [[Lodovico Castelvetro|Castelvetro]] insisted that playwrights and directors adhere to the unities. In the ''Poetics'' Aristotle had merely  recommended that action should consist only of the main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] without any [[subplot]]s, and that the time represented by action should not stretch beyond the length of one day. Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the [[attention]] span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.&lt;br&gt;The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.

==Theatre presentation==

Some [[dramatist]]s and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.

===Defamiliarization effect (Verfremdungseffekt)===
[[Bertolt Brecht]] coined the term "defamiliarization effect" (sometimes called "estrangement effect" or "alienation effect"; German ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'') for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what is being presented. See [[epic theater]].

==Teichoscopy==

One of the oldest techniques that has been used often, is that of ''[[teichoscopy]]'' or the "viewing from the wall", in which actors observe events beyond the confines of the stage, such as a distant battle, and discuss it on stage while the battle is taking place, as opposed to the event being reported by messengers at a later time after the event has happened. [[Shakespeare]] uses this technique in the final scenes of the play Julius Ceasre''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7634">The word ''' Titling''', in the performing arts (opera, drama, audiovisual productions), defines the work of linguistic mediation encompassing [[subtitling]] and [[surtitling]].

==History==
Subtitling developed starting from 1917, during the silent film era, whereas surtitling has been used in the live performing arts since 1983 (at the dawning of digital systems).&lt;br /&gt;
With the appearance of new information systems, which opened the door to [[multilingual titling]] ([[DVD]] was launched on the market in 1986) terminological debate started, too.&lt;br /&gt;
In the audiovisual system, even when more than one language was used, subtitles maintained their position unchanged for many years. The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
Even more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices ([[Santa Fe Opera]], 1998)&lt;ref name="(Santa Fe Opera, 1998)"&gt;[[Figaro Systems]] introduced in 1998 at Santa Fe Opera a custom multilingual display system recalling the aircraft video display units; this system has been lately adopted, through different companies, by some of the most prominent international theatres, such as Copenhagen, Milan, Moscow, Muscat, New York, Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt; or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]], 2011) &lt;ref name="(Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011)"&gt;OperaVoice, in the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino Theatre’s season 2011-2012, developed a wireless multilingual transmission system which is to use mobile consumer devices owned by the audience (smartphones and tablets), and is also interfaceable with projected surtitles.&lt;/ref&gt; or on hybrid solutions ([[Royal Opera House Muscat]], 2012),&lt;ref name="(Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012)"&gt;[[Radio Marconi]], in 2011-2012, realized for the Royal Opera House Muscat the most advanced system of custom multilingual interactive displays integrated to surtitles on LED panel.&lt;/ref&gt; makes the spatial connotation of the term "sur-titles" inappropriate.

==Terminology==
In both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term "titling", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).&lt;ref name=" not specifying if the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles)"&gt;This is also recommended in: FREDDI M. e LURAGHI S., ''Titling for the Opera House: a Test Case for Universals of Translations? '' in INCALCATERRA McLOUGHLIN L., eds., ''Audiovisual Translation'', Peter Lang, Bern-Berlin-New York 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toastmaster''' is a general term, prevalent in the [[United States]] in the middle 20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a [[public speaking]] event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/toastmaster|title=toastmaster {{!}} Definition of toastmaster in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such meetings typically include civic events, [[service organization]] meetings, and banquets of various purpose.  In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a [[dais]] or from a [[podium]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live [[television]], the toastmaster often takes the form of a [[master of ceremonies]], introducing the entertainment acts.{{or|date=June 2018}} {{citation needed span|The term has fallen out of use to a large degree.|date=June 2018}}

James Toole, father of actor [[John Lawrence Toole]] was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallalieu|first=Huon|date=18 May 2016|title=Raise a Toast|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/docview/1791987622?accountid=13905|journal=Country Life|volume=|pages=126-127|access-date=4 June 2018|subscription=Yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are many allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his "stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1847|title=Obituary|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=e2odAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=james+Toole+toastmaster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V89PiNF9oJ&amp;sig=mhAIPKFe0qs58Q39A47V5fDqcK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsiuCglrnbAhXLvbwKHcAGBgQQ6AEIbzAR#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20Toole%20toastmaster&amp;f=false|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|volume=181|pages=327-328|access-date=4 June 2018|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17688625|title=Stylish start for the 1908 Games|last=Mower|first=Jane|date=27 April 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16840785|title=Famous Toastmaster Dead.|last=|first=|date=15 February 1932|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=4 June 2018|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely known person associated with this role was [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], known in his lifetime as "Toastmaster General of the United States" (parodying the title [[Postmaster General of the United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/obituaries/george-jessel-comedian-and-toastmaster-dies-at-83.html|title=George Jessel, Comedian and Toastmaster, dies at 83|last=|first=|date=25 May 1981|work=New York TImes|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2018}} service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century  to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the [[fear of public speaking]]. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light [[humor]], and to have [[anecdote]]s and [[epigram]]s handily memorized. [[Toastmasters International]] is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.{{or|date=June 2018}}

Such was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/toastmasters-glass|title=Toastmaster's glass|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">The '''Tripe Marketing Board''' is a UK based online publication which seeks to promote the consumption of [[tripe]] through the use of humour. The ''LA Times'' has described the group as an 'internet and publishing phenomenon that may or may not be completely serious.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-tripe-marketing-board-20141020-story.html|title=A voice for tripe: An exclusive interview with Sir Norman Wrassle|last=Parsons|first=Russ|date=October 20, 2014|website=LA Times|publisher=LA Times|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It parodies defunct government organisations such as the [[Milk Marketing Board|Milk]] and [[Potato Marketing Board|Potato]] [[Marketing board]]s.

The group came to prominence in 2012 when it managed to persuade a number of serious media outlets that it was a real entity. ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' interviewed a tripe seller in Blackburn about the attempt to improve the public perception of tripe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bid-to-get-classic-dish-tripe-back-1274711|last=White|first=Steve|date=23 August 2012|title=What a load of tripe: New bid to get classic dish back on the menu|website=The Mirror|publisher=The Mirror|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters at ''The Times'' newspaper investigated the TMB a number of days later, concluding that it was a 'very funny spoof'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/columnists/article3521023.ece|title=Clever marketing, or a load of old tripe?|last=Waller|first=Martin|date=29 August 2012|website=The Times|publisher=The Times|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal Classic Monsters''' is a phrase used to describe the [[Horror film|horror]], [[Fantasy film|fantasy]], [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]] films made by [[Universal Pictures]] during the decades of the 1920s through the 1950s. They began with ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', both [[silent films]] starring [[Lon Chaney]]. Universal continued with [[Sound film|talkies]] including monster franchises ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'', ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. The films often featured [[Bela Lugosi]], [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]]

In 1923, Universal produced the drama ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', starring [[Lon Chaney]] as [[Quasimodo]]. The production sets were built to evoke 15th-century Paris, including a re-creation of the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] cathedral.

Chaney stars as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] in 1925's horror film, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', based on the [[The Phantom of the Opera|mystery novel]] by [[Gaston Leroux]]. The interior of the [[Opéra Garnier]] was recreated to scale and was used again in the 1943 remake with [[Claude Rains]].

===1930s===

[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'']]

In 1931, [[Bela Lugosi]] starred in Universal's ''Dracula'' and [[Boris Karloff]] in ''Frankenstein''. Actors [[Dwight Frye]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]], who played major supporting roles in both films, made several film appearances in this decade. Make-up artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created several monsters' make-up starting in the 1930s.

''The Mummy'', starring Karloff, was produced in 1932. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on the tales of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]: ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932) starring Lugosi, ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), the latter two of which teamed Lugosi with Karloff. Universal began releasing sequels including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936) and sequels for ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933). The first mainstream werewolf picture, ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (1935) starring [[Henry Hull]], was not a box office triumph despite being revered by audiences today.

The end of Universal’s first run of horror films came in 1936. The monster movies were dropped from the production schedule altogether and would not re-emerge for another three years. In the meantime, a theatre owner revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a resoundingly successful double feature, prompting the studio to re-release the original movies. ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), starring [[Basil Rathbone]], Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi, was filmed as a result of the unexpected resurgence.

===1940s===
During the 1940s, Universal released ''The Wolf Man'' (1941), with [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] The junior Chaney became the studio's leading monster movie actor in the 1940s, just as his father had been two decades earlier, supplanting the 1930s' Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney Jr. physically resembled his father apart from usually being somewhat overweight, which the senior Chaney never was. The studio dropped the "Jr." from the junior Chaney's billing almost immediately to confuse some in the audiences into assuming that this was the same actor.

In 1943, the studio created a remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'', this time starring [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Susanna Foster]] with Claude Rains as the Phantom.

The ''Frankenstein'' and ''Wolf Man'' series continued with ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942), in which Chaney Jr. played Frankenstein's monster and Lugosi reprised his role as Ygor, and ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' (1943) with Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster and Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. ''Son of Dracula'' (1943) featured Chaney Jr. in Lugosi's original role as the Count. The ''Mummy'' series was also continued with ''[[The Mummy's Hand]]'' (1940), ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (both 1944) with Chaney Jr. as the Mummy in the last three films. ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944) and ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945) featured many of the monsters from the studio's previous films. As the decade drew to a close, the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) features Lugosi in only his second film as [[Count Dracula]], alongside Chaney Jr. as [[Larry Talbot]] (the Wolf Man), and [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]].

===1950s===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:CreaturefromtheBlackLagoon.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ben Chapman (actor)|Ben Chapman]] in ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'']] --&gt;
Abbott and Costello appeared in films featuring characters such as the Mummy and the Invisible Man.

''Creature from the Black Lagoon'', directed by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]], was released in 1954. ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' were re-released as double features in theatres, and were later broadcast in syndication on American television in 1957 as part of the ''[[Shock Theater]]'' package of Universal Monster Movies.&lt;ref name="Okuda"&gt;{{cite book|last = Okuda|first = Ted|authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Yurkiw, Mark |title = Chicago TV Horror Movie Shows: From Shock Theatre to Svengoolie|publisher = Lake Claremont Press|year = 2007|page = 14|isbn = 978-1893121133|quote= The 'Shock!' package was sold in 142 markets. As a result, stations across the country aired a late-night ''Shock Theatre'' series to showcase these pictures.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines such as ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' covered the monster films. Universal spent the last half of the decade issuing a number of one-shot monster films.

===Dark Universe===
[[File:Dark Universe official logo.jpg|thumb|242x242px|Official logo of the Dark Universe, shared film universe as released by Universal Pictures]]
Dark Universe is the term given by Universal Pictures to their planned [[cinematic universe]], which will be based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. The studio's first attempt at this universe was with the film ''[[Dracula Untold]]''. Released on October 10, 2014, with [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] in the [[Count Dracula|titular role]], the film was developed prior to plans for a shared universe of horror films. However, it was retooled to be a part of the franchise. The film's mixed financial and critical reception resulted in the film's future status within the franchise becoming uncertain. Since the release of ''Dracula Untold'', the connections to the shared universe have been downplayed. Universal, which had announced plans to reboot [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'' franchise]] in 2012, decided to re-position the new installment as the first film in the series. ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was set to be released in 2017 with [[Alex Kurtzman]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Universal Stakes Out Release Date for Third Monster Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-stakes-release-date-third-890292|accessdate=September 24, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|title=What Universal Must Do To Sell Its Classic Monsters Universe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/07/13/what-universal-must-do-to-sell-its-classic-monsters-universe/#7772cec46b38|accessdate=September 24, 2016|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kurtzman and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] were announced as headlining the Dark Universe, with collaborations from [[David Koepp]] and [[Christopher McQuarrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-1495481404-htmlstory.html|title=Universal debuts its spooky new Dark Universe and its upcoming 'Bride of Frankenstein'|publisher=''LA Times''|author=Woerner, Meredith|date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the crew, Universal announced the casting of [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde]], [[Javier Bardem]] as the [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein Monster]], and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]]. They would join [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Sofia Boutella]], as Nick Morton and Princess Ahmanet / The Mummy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''World Wide Telecom Web''' (also called as '''Spoken Web''' or '''Telecom Web''') is an initiative to create an alternate web for the under-privileged. It could help bridge the [[digital divide]] by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from [[World Wide Web]]. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing [[World Wide Web|Web]].&lt;ref name="WWTW"&gt;WWTW: The World Wide Telecom Web, In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networked Systems for Developing Regions (NSDR), August 2007, Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_person_subpage.php?id=1649 The World Wide Telecom Web -]&lt;/ref&gt;

WWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.&lt;ref name="WWTW"/&gt;

==How it works==
WWTW is a network of interconnected '''VoiceSites''' (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications ''created by'' users themselves and ''hosted'' in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.

Key enabler technologies include:

1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator

2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine

3. [[HSTP]] - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol

4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser

==Brief history==
World Wide Telecom Web was conceived by [http://researcher.ibm.com/view.php?person=in-kkarun Arun Kumar] at [[IBM]] [http://www.research.ibm.com/irl/ India Research Lab] during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/rajput.index.html Nitendra Rajput] in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and [[VoiceXML]] standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/chakraborty.index.html Dipanjan Chakraborty] and colleague Sandeep Jindal &amp; Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. [[C.K. Prahalad]] and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/nanavati.index.html Amit Anil Nanavati] got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a [http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/9fb1978638a52de5852572890036ddc2?OpenDocument Research Report]. Soon after [http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~sheetal2/ Sheetal K. Agarwal] joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/arun_kumar.wwtwpubs.html World Wide Telecom Web Publications].
This included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of [http://www2008.org/papers/pdf/p1123-agarwal.pdf Voikiosk] system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.
