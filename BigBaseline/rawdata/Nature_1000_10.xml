[[Evolutionary biology]], in particular the understanding of how organisms evolve through natural selection, is an area of science with many practical applications.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bull JJ |author2=Wichman HA |title=Applied evolution |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=32 |pages=183–217 |date=2001 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mindell|first=DP|title=The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life|date=2007|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0674025585|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists often claim that the theory of evolution lacks any practical applications; however, this claim has been refuted by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claim CA215:  The theory of evolution is useless, without practical application|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider biology==
The evolutionary approach is key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and [[ecology]]. For example, evolutionary thinking is key to [[life history theory]]. [[gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative, that is evolutionary, approaches. The field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

==Artificial selection==
{{main|Artificial selection}}
A major technological application of evolution is [[artificial selection]], which is the intentional selection of certain traits in a population of organisms. Humans have used artificial selection for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doebley JF |author2= Gaut BS |author3=Smith BD |title=The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1309–21 |date=2006 |pmid=17190597 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA in [[molecular biology]]. It is also possible to use repeated rounds of mutation and selection to evolve proteins with particular properties, such as modified [[enzyme]]s or new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jäckel C |author2=Kast P |author3=Hilvert D |title=Protein design by directed evolution |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |pages=153–73 |date=2008 |pmid=18573077 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
[[File:Antibiotic resistance.svg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of how antibiotic resistance evolves via natural selection. The top section represents a population of bacteria before exposure to an antibiotic. The middle section shows the population directly after exposure, the phase in which selection took place. The last section shows the distribution of resistance in a new generation of bacteria. The legend indicates the resistance levels of individuals.]]
[[Antibiotic resistance]] can be a result of point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure; those bacteria which have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will result in a fully resistant colony.

Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maher B. |title=Evolution: Biology's next top model? |journal=Nature |volume=458 |issue=7239 |pages=695–8 |date=2009 |doi=10.1038/458695a |pmid=19360058 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Mexican tetra]] is an [[albino]] cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borowsky R |title=Restoring sight in blind cavefish |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=R23–4 |date=2008 |pmid=18177707 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation, such as [[crystallin]]s and the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gross JB |author2=Borowsky R |author3=Tabin CJ |title=A novel role for Mc1r in the parallel evolution of depigmentation in independent populations of the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=e1000326 |date=2009 |pmid=19119422 |pmc=2603666 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000326 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, comparing the genome of the [[Notothenioidei|Antarctic icefish]], which lacks [[red blood cell]]s, to close relatives such as the Antarctic rockcod revealed genes needed to make these blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yergeau DA |author2=Cornell CN |author3=Parker SK |author4=Zhou Y |author5=Detrich HW |title=bloodthirsty, an RBCC/TRIM gene required for erythropoiesis in zebrafish |journal=Dev. Biol. |volume=283 |issue=1 |pages=97–112 |date=2005 |pmid=15890331 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.04.006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
{{main|Evolutionary computation}}
As evolution can produce highly optimised processes and networks, it has many applications in [[computer science]]. Here, simulations of evolution using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |date=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |date=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |date=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |date=1992 |title=Genetic Programming |issue=On the Programming of Computers by Means of [[Natural Selection]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jamshidi M |title=Tools for intelligent control: fuzzy controllers, neural networks and genetic algorithms |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=361 |issue=1809 |pages=1781–808 |date=2003 |pmid=12952685 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2003.1225 |ref=harv|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361.1781J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Dickinsonia|Dickinsonia costata]]'' is one of the enigmatic [[fossil]]s, possibly an early [[animal]], in the [[Precambrian]] [[Ediacaran biota]].]]
The '''Avalon explosion''', named from the [[Precambrian]] fauna of the [[Avalon Peninsula]], is a proposed [[evolutionary radiation]] in the history of the [[Animalia]], about 575 million years ago, some 33 million years earlier than the [[Cambrian explosion]].

==Evidence==
[[File:Ediacaran trace fossil.jpg|thumb|Ediacaran trace fossil]]

Trace fossils of these Avalon organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Simple multicellular organisms such as [[red alga]]e evolved at least {{Ma|1200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avalon explosion produced the [[Ediacaran biota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080103144451.htm |title=Two Explosive Evolutionary Events Shaped Early History Of Multicellular Life |publisher=Virginia Tech|date=January 4, 2008|via=ScienceDaily |language=en |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shen2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shen |first=Bing |last2=Dong |first2=Lin |last3=Xiao |first3=Shuhai |last4=Kowalewski |first4=Michał |date=4 January 2008 |title=The Avalon Explosion: Evolution of Ediacara Morphospace |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5859/81 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |language=en |volume=319 |issue=5859 |pages=81–84 |bibcode=2008Sci...319...81S |doi=10.1126/science.1150279 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=18174439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biota largely disappeared contemporaneously with the rapid increase in [[biodiversity]] known as the Cambrian explosion.

The Avalon explosion appears similar to the Cambrian explosion in the rapid increase in diversity of [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] in a relatively small time frame, followed by diversification within the established body plans,&lt;ref name="Shen2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xiao |first=Shuhai |last2=Laflamme |first2=Marc |date=January 2009 |title=On the eve of animal radiation: phylogeny, ecology and evolution of the Ediacara biota |journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.07.015 |pmid=18952316}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pattern similar to that observed in other evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"/&gt;

==History==

The Avalon explosion was proposed in 2008 by [[Virginia Tech]] [[paleontologists]] through the analysis of the morphological space change in several [[Ediacaran]] assemblages.&lt;ref name="Shen2007" /&gt; The discovery suggests that in the early evolution of [[animals]], there may have been more than one explosive event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2580/the-avalon-explosion |title=The Avalon Explosion |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |access-date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original analysis has been the subject of dispute in the literature.&lt;ref name="Freeman2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Gary |title=The rise of bilaterians |journal=Historical Biology |volume=21 |issue=1-2 |pages=99–114 |doi=10.1080/08912960903295843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiao2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xiao |first=Shuhai |last2=Kowalewski |first2=Michał |last3=Shen |first3=Bing |last4=Dong |first4=Lin |last5=Laflamme |first5=Marc |date=8 January 2010 |title=The rise of bilaterians: a reply |journal=[[Historical Biology]] |volume=21 |issue=3-4 |pages=239–246 |doi=10.1080/08912960903471659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Gary |date=30 Jun 2010 |title=Comment on Xiao et al.

'''Bobdownsite''' is the [[fluorine]] bearing mineral of the [[whitlockite]] group of [[phosphate minerals]] whose formula is Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(Mg)(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F). It is isotypic with whitlockite and was misidentified as such until proper chemical analysis. Whitlockites structure and relationships with other phosphate compounds has been extensively studied. Bobdownsite was first recovered from Big Fish River, Yukon, Canada from a Lower [[Cretaceous]] outcrop of bedded ironstones and shales. Bobdownsite is named after Robert Terrace Downs a professor of mineralogy in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, who lived and worked in the Yukon Territory in the 1970s.  Bobdownsite is unique because it is the first known naturally forming phosphate to contain a P-F bond.

Bobdownsite is closely related to whitlockite and [[merrillite]].

==Geological occurrences== 
Bobdownsite is originally found from Big Fish River, Yukon, Canada (about Latitude 68°28'N, Longitude 136°30'W). Bobdownsite occurs in a [[Vein (geology)|vein]] from an east- west- trending faulted vein. Samples recovered from this exposure are found with [[Lower Cretaceous]] bedded [[ironstone]]s and [[shale]]s. Bobdownsite is a phosphate mineral with its exposure downstream from  [[phosphate nodule]] slopes. The vein at the exposure is composed of anhedral and euhedral crystals and is 0 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm wide. It occurs associated with [[siderite]], [[lazulite]], [[kulanite]], [[gormanite]], [[quartz]] and [[collinsite]]. Bobdownsite has also been reported from the Tip Top mine of [[Custer County, South Dakota]]. Furthermore, it has been found with other witlockite group minerals in [[Martian meteorites]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tait, Kimberly T.,Madison C. Barkley, Richard M. Thompson, Marcus J. Origlieri, Stanley H. Evans, Charles T. Prewitt, and Hexiong Yang, "Bobdownsite, A New Mineral Species From Big FIsh River, Yukon, Canada, and Its Structural Relationship With Whitlockite-Type Compounds", The Canadian Mineralogist, 49.4 (2011): (1065-1078). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meteorites ===
Bobdownsite, whitlockite, and merrillite are all important phosphate minerals found closely related in lunar rocks. Merrillite crystals with considerable amounts of fluorine and traces of chlorine were found in several Martian meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;Gnos, E., et al. (2002): Sayh al Uhaymir 094: a new martian meteorite from the Oman desert: Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science 37, 835-854.&lt;/ref&gt; But more research conducted on bobdownsite suggests that an F content of greater that about 0.9 wt%, including F- bearing merrillite, is bobdownsite.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Physical properties==
In Yukon, Canada bobdownsite is found composed of anhedral and euhedral crystals, tabular, colorless in transmitted light, transparent, with a white streak and a vitreous luster. The Tip Top mine sample has [[Druse (geology)|druses]] of pale purple, yellow, or transparent colorless rhombohedral crystals, brittle, with a hardness about 5, no cleavage, parting or twinning, and an uneven and subconchoidal fracture. Bobdownsite has a density of 3.14 and 3.16 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is insoluble in water, acetone, or hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Crystallography ===
Bobdownsite is isostructural with whitlockite having a trigonal crystal system and R3c space group. The point group is 3m with unit cell parameters ''ɑ'' 1.3224(3) Å, c 37.70(2) Å, ''V'' 3420.7(6) Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Bobdownsite has trigonal - ditrigonal pyramid&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt; tabular, euhedral crystals. The mineral is characterized by [M(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; ligands held together by intralayer Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations to form layers parallel to (001). The layers parallel to (001) are further linked by intralayer Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations along [001]. These ligands can be referred to as the "Mg pinwheel". The pinwheels are formed in closest packed planar arrangement using the term cubic eutaxy. For this arrangement to happen there are tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The octahedral sites contain PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F tetrahedral groups which are approximately in the midplane between the two pinwheel layers and are each coordinated to the closest two interlayer Ca cations by the oxygen. The P position in the PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F is located either just above or just below the midplane between the two pinwheel layers, leading to the F to point either along +c or -c. The metal of the whitlockite- type compounds is slightly offset from the origin along c and is octahedrally coordinated residing at the center of the M pinwheel. The layers stack in an ABAB fashion along the c, there is no obvious eutaxy, they can be described as chains of corner-sharing LiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra cross connected by PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F tetrahedra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12156">[[File:LA LEY DE MURPHY.jpg|thumb|This is an example of toast that has landed butter-side down.]]
The '''buttered toast phenomenon''' is an [[observation]] that [[butter]]ed [[toast]] tends to land butter-side down after it falls. It is used an [[idiom]] representing pessimistic outlooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/butter-side-down.html|title='Why does bread always fall buttered side down?' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various people have attempted to determine whether there is an actual tendency for bread to fall in this fashion, with varying results.

==Origins==

The phenomenon is said to be an old proverb from "the north country." Written accounts can be traced to the mid-19th century. The phenomenon is often attributed to a parodic poem of [[James Payn]] from 1884:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apperson|first1=George Latimer|title=Dictionary of Proverbs|date=2005|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd.|location=Ware|isbn=1840223111|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7PMZJqSR4sAC&amp;dq=I%27ve+never+had+a+piece+of+toast+Particularly+long+and+wide%2C+But+fell+upon+the+sanded+floor%2C+And+always+on+the+buttered+side.&amp;q=buttered+toast#v=onepage&amp;q=buttered&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgaUQc8NbTYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%C2%A0James+Payn+from+1884+butter+side+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eUG4bkloJ2&amp;sig=SAta2G677ttPbqmzrWIsGij9iIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6L-pw7vUAhUR92MKHQOHAhcQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0James%20Payn%20from%201884%20butter%20side%20down&amp;f=false|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs|last=Manser|first=Martin H.|date=2007|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=9780816066735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|
I never had a slice of bread,&lt;br /&gt;
Particularly large and wide,&lt;br /&gt;
That did not fall upon the floor,&lt;br /&gt;
And always on the buttered side!
}}

In the past, this has often been considered just a pessimistic belief. A study by the [[BBC]]'s television series ''[[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|Q.E.D.]]'' found that when toast is thrown in the air, it lands butter-side down just one-half of the time (as would be predicted by chance).&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt; However, several scientific studies have found that when toast is dropped from a table (as opposed to being thrown in the air), it does fall butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breakfast at Murphy's (or why the toast lands butter-side down) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331810/Breakfast-at-Murphys-or-why-the-toast-lands-butter-side-down.html |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2001 |first=Robert |last=Matthews |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=R.

== Explanation ==

When toast falls out of one's hand, it does so at an angle, by nature of it having slipped from its previous position, then the toast rotates. Given that tables are usually between two and six feet (0.7 to 1.83 meters), there is enough time for the toast to rotate about one-half of a turn, and thus lands upside down relative to its original position. Since the original position is usually butter-side up, the toast lands butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buttered Toast and Other Patterns |url=https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_july_98.html |date=July 1998 |website=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |first=Keith |last=Devlin |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the table is over 10 feet (3 meters) tall, the toast will rotate a full 360 degrees, and land butter-side up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite show |title=Butter Side Down |url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/butter-side-down/ |series=[[The Naked Scientists]] |network=[[BBC]] |date=16 December 2007 |first1=Ben |last1=Valsler |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the toast travels horizontally at over 3.6 miles per hour (1.6&amp;nbsp;m/s), the toast will not rotate enough to land butter-side down.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic&gt;{{cite web |title=The Anthropomurphic Principle |url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/anthro/anthro.html |website=Why Do Math? |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |first=Ian |last=Stewart |date=1995 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the phenomenon is caused by fundamental [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name="European-Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matthews |first=R A J |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist) |title=Tumbling toast, Murphy's Law and the fundamental constants|journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] |date=18 July 1995 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=172–176 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/16/4/005 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/16/4/005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |bibcode = 1995EJPh...16..172M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==

The added weight of the butter has no effect on the falling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why does a falling piece of toast always seem to land on the buttered side? |url=http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |publisher=How Come? |date=2009-08-17 |first=Kathy |last=Wollard |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830231610/http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |archivedate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the butter spreads throughout the slice.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt;

{{quote
|text=The mass of butter added to toast ( ~4g ) is small compared to the mass of the typical slice of toast (~35g), is spread thinly, and passes into the body of the toast. Its contribution to the total movement of inertia of the toast and rotational dynamics, thus its effect on the toast is negligible.
|title=Tumbling toast, Murphy’s Law and the Fundamental Constants
|author=Roberts A J Matthews}}

The following findings are from Mythbusters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythbusterstheexhibition.com/science-content/butter-side-up/#article|title=Mythbusters Museum|website=Mythbusters Museum|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Period of Rotation''': The usual scenario for a falling piece of toast is that a non-rotating slice slides or careens off a horizontal surface, such as a plate or table, over a fairly straight lip, which serves as a momentary fulcrum. In this scenario, the leading edge (or corner) is subject to the downward acceleration of gravity—without a countering force from the horizontal surface—sooner than the trailing edge (or corner). The interval where the leading edge of the toast is accelerating downward faster than the trailing edge imparts angular momentum. Once the toast begins to fall freely, air resistance governs any further change in angular momentum, with the toast serving as a complex airfoil (extremely difficult to analyze, especially if the toast has large, irregular holes). For a short fall, the initial angular momentum will dominate. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the toast to complete a full 360 degree spin. The problem for toast, in the typical case, is that the floor interrupts its fall somewhere in between a 90 degree and 270 toast rotation—this will cause the toast to go from butter-side-up to butter-side-down. With a higher the release point, there is a greater the chance for it to rotate beyond 270 degrees and consequently land butter-side-up. An even higher release point could cause the toast to rotate more than once, and again land butter-side down, but this is no longer a short fall at low velocity, and turbulence in this case should not be neglected. (Frisbee toast would resist the fulcrum torque due to [[gyroscopic effect]]s and probably not accord with this analysis.) 
* '''Moment of Inertia''': At the moment a piece of toast begins flipping towards the kitchen floor, it has inertia—it doesn’t want to stop flipping if it doesn’t have to. Its moment of inertia is determined by the speed at which the toast is flipping, combined with the size and mass of the toast. Most breakfast toast is about the same size and mass, unless you’re in Texas—home of the giant slices that carry the state name. But any way you slice it, the same rules apply. Add a little velocity to the spin as your breakfast goes sliding off your plate—give it a smack to add some inertia and see how it lands.
* '''Angular Momentum''': Just like a frisbee or a gyroscope, your toast gains stability when it spins. In fact, the faster it spins, the more stable it gets. This is angular momentum, or mass in motion around a single point, in action. Newton once claimed that a mass in motion likes to stay that way, and this is definitely true for toast. Once your toast is spinning, it wants to keep spinning—that is, until some other force acts on it, like the floor.

==In popular culture==
[[File:RamirezJelly.png|thumb|right|Ramirez's demonstration of the buttered toast phenomenon to prove that the devil is nearby.]]
In the 2010 [[M. Night Shyamalan]] film ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a group of adults in an elevator become trapped by unknown forces. Slowly over the course of the film, people begin to die in the elevator as the power blinks on and off, pinning the people against each other and creating a false narrative that the others are murderers (However, it is common opinion that the name of the film spoiled this false narrative). In the film, supporting cast member and fictional security guard Ramirez, in his suspicion that there may be unholy forces at play, dropped a slice of toast with jelly on one side, and dropped it on the floor. The toast landed on the jelly-side, after which Ramirez coined the phrase "Jelly Side Down," and subsequently 'proved' that the devil was nearby. However, there is some dispute in the film about whether or not this did actually prove the devil was near.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated and parodied in the October 29, 2013 ''[[Nostalgia Critic]]'' review of ''Devil'', (Reuploaded on July 23, 2016 by [[Channel Awesome]] on YouTube) in which actor [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]] plays a priest who uses multiple food items to determine whether or not the Devil is near. After the other items show no sign of the Devil, the priest tosses a piece of toast as the last test. The toast lands jelly side down which means the Devil is near and the end of the world is imminent. Everybody in the church screams and panics as the priest repeatedly shouts, "Jelly side down!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFmdbXvLvI|title=Devil - Nostalgia Critic season 6, episode 40|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2016|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018|author=Doug and Rob Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character evolution''' is the process by which a [[Character (biology)|character]] or [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] (a certain body part or property of an organism) evolves along the branches of an evolutionary tree. Character evolution usually refers to single changes within a lineage that make this lineage unique from others. These changes are called character state changes and they are often used in the study of evolution to provide a record of common ancestry. Character state changes can be phenotypic changes, [[nucleotide]] substitutions, or [[amino acid]] substitutions. These small changes in a species can be identifying features of when exactly a new lineage diverged from an old one.

==Phylogenetics==
In the study of [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], researchers can look at the characters shared by a collection of species and then group them into what is called a [[clade]].  The term clade was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J.

== Natural Selection ==
[[File:Darwins first tree.jpg|thumb|Charles Darwin's first sketch of an evolutionary tree]]
Natural Selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are selected to survive and reproduce more offspring. Natural selection selects for the phenotype or the characteristics of an organism that gives the organism a reproductive advantage in which it becomes the gene pool of a population. In addition, mutations also arise in the genome of an individual organism and offspring(s) can inherit such mutations. This genetic variation allows more organisms to adapt to a changing environment.

==Maximum Parsimony==
It is often the case in the study of phylogenies that the vast majority of organisms of interest are long [[extinction|extinct]].  It is therefore a matter of speculation to reconstruct what ancestral organisms existed long before the present time, and how the evolutionary process led from one organism to another, and which present-day organisms are most closely related. Character evolution and the character state changes that drive this type of evolution are what help researchers construct these trees in a fashion referred to as [[maximum parsimony]].  When talking about phylogenetics, maximum parsimony refers to a method of inferring a phylogenetic tree in a way that minimizes the number of implied character state transformations in the observed data (hence ''maximally parsimonious''). The basic ideas were presented by James S. Farris &lt;ref name="Farris1970"&gt;Farris, J. S.  (1970). Methods for computing Wagner trees.  ''Systematic Zoology''  19, 83-92.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970.

Although fairly effective, maximum parsimony (like any method of phylogenetic inference) may not recover the true course of evolution for a given feature. For a number of reasons, two organisms can possess a trait not present in their last common ancestor.  The phenomena of [[convergent evolution]], [[parallel evolution]], and [[atavism|evolutionary reversals]] (collectively termed ''homoplasy'') are evolutionary forces that may disrupt the effectiveness of the maximum parsimony method of inferring phylogenetic relationships.  However, Rindal and Brower &lt;ref name="Rindal and Brower2010"&gt;Rindal, E. and Brower A.V.Z. (2010) Do model‐based phylogenetic analyses perform better than parsimony? A test with empirical data. ''Cladistics'' 27, 331-334.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the vast majority of the time, parsimony and model-based phylogenetic analyses of the same data sets gave results that were not significantly different from one another, implying that if parsimony is producing false hypotheses of relationships due to homoplasy, then the Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods are doing so as well.

== Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics ==
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck.jpg|thumb|128x128px|Jean-Baptise Lamarck, the creator of the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics]]
Lamarck is best known for his ''Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics'' in 1801. His theory states that the characteristics an organism acquires throughout its life in order to adapt to its environment are passed down to its offspring. For example, Lamarck believed that the long necks of giraffes evolved as generations of giraffes reached for ever higher leaves of a tree. Their offspring and later generations inherited the resulting long necks.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.]]
[[File:Cornselection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Selective breeding]] transformed [[teosinte]]'s small spikes (left) into modern [[maize]] (right). [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] argued that [[evolution]] worked in a similar way.]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]] by [[natural selection]], at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]].

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, arguing from circumstantial evidence that selection by human breeders could produce change, and that since there was clearly a struggle for existence, that natural selection must be taking place. But he lacked an explanation either for [[genetic variation]] or for [[heredity]], both essential to the theory. Many [[alternatives to natural selection|alternative theories]] were accordingly considered by biologists, threatening to undermine Darwinian evolution.

Some of the first evidence was provided by Darwin's contemporaries, the naturalists [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]]. They described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain. 
Darwinists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], and in the 20th century [[Hugh Cott]] and [[Bernard Kettlewell]], sought evidence that natural selection was taking place. Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment. Poulton's 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', written [[Eclipse of Darwinism|during Darwinism's lowest ebb]], used all the forms of coloration to argue the case for natural selection. Cott described many kinds of camouflage, and in particular his drawings of coincident [[disruptive coloration]] in frogs convinced other biologists that these deceptive markings were products of natural selection. Kettlewell experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]], showing that the species had [[industrial melanism|adapted as pollution changed the environment]]; this provided compelling evidence of Darwinian evolution.

==Camouflage==
{{main|Camouflage}}

[[File:Arcticfox-3.jpg|thumb|[[Snow camouflage]]: [[Arctic fox]] is mainly brown in summer, all white in winter.]]

===Snow camouflage===
{{main|Snow camouflage}}

In his 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] considered the white coloration of [[Arctic]] animals. He recorded that the [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[stoat|ermine]] and [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] change their colour seasonally, and gave "the obvious explanation", that it was for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the case of prey animals like the Arctic hare, this is concealment from predators, reducing the chance of being seen and eaten, directly affecting survival. In the case of predators like the Arctic fox, camouflage provides concealment from prey, increasing the change of a successful hunt, and again improving survival chances. Thus whether the camouflage is defensive or aggressive, it would be favoured by natural selection. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] named the two cases "general protective resemblance" and "general aggressive resemblance" respectively.&lt;ref name=Poulton/&gt;}} The modern ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that [[crypsis|cryptic]] brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." All the same, he notes, "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by [[Gyrfalcon]]s throughout the winter."&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W. L. N. |title=White Plumage |journal=Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology |date=March 2003 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |jstor=1522461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, decreasing snow cover in Poland, caused by [[global warming]], is reflected in a reduced percentage of [[Mustela nivalis|white-coated weasels]] that become white in winter. Days with snow cover halved between 1997 and 2007, and as few as 20 percent of the weasels had white winter coats. This was shown to be a result of natural selection by predators making use of camouflage mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=White-furred animals could die out because of climate change, study suggests |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/05/24/white-animals-could-die-climate-change-study-suggests/ |accessdate=24 May 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atmeh Andruszkiewicz Zub 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Atmeh | first=Kamal | last2=Andruszkiewicz | first2=Anna | last3=Zub | first3=Karol | title=Climate change is affecting mortality of weasels due to camouflage mismatch | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=7648 | date=24 May 2018 | doi=10.1038/s41598-018-26057-5| pmid=29795400 | pmc=5967304 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7648A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Coincident disruptive coloration}}

In the words of camouflage researchers [[Innes Cuthill]] and A. Székely, the English zoologist and [[List of camoufleurs|camouflage expert]] [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' provided "persuasive arguments for the survival value of coloration, and for [[adaptation]] in general, at [[Eclipse of Darwinism|a time when natural selection was far from universally accepted]] within evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Innes Cuthill|Cuthill, I. C.]]; Székely, A. |editor=[[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Stevens, Martin]]; Merilaita, Sami |title=Animal Camouflage: Mechanisms and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10TCvK-9v70C&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-139-49623-0 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they argue, "Coincident Disruptive Coloration" (one of Cott's categories) "made Cott's drawings the most compelling evidence for natural selection enhancing survival through [[disruptive camouflage]]."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt; Cott explained, while discussing "a little frog known as [[Afrixalus fornasini|''Megalixalus fornasinii'']]" in his chapter on coincident disruptive coloration, that "it is only when the pattern is considered in relation to the frog's normal attitude of rest that its remarkable nature becomes apparent... The attitude and very striking colour-scheme thus combine to produce an extraordinary effect, whose deceptive appearance depends upon the breaking up of the entire form into two strongly contrasted areas of brown and white. Considered separately, neither part resembles part of a frog. Together in nature the white configuration alone is conspicuous. This stands out and distracts the observer's attention from the true form and contour of the body and appendages on which it is superimposed".&lt;ref name=Cott1940&gt;{{cite book | author=Cott, Hugh B. | authorlink=Hugh B. Cott | year=1940 | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals | publisher=Methuen | url=https://archive.org/details/adaptivecolorati00cott | pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cott concluded that the effect was concealment "so long as the false configuration is recognized in preference to the real one".&lt;ref name=Cott1940/&gt; Such patterns embody, as Cott stressed, considerable precision as the markings must line up accurately for the disguise to work. Cott's description and in particular his drawings convinced biologists that the markings, and hence the camouflage, must have survival value (rather than occurring by chance); and further, as Cuthill and Székely indicate, that the bodies of animals that have such patterns must indeed have been shaped by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Lichte en zwarte versie berkenspanner.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard Kettlewell]] claimed that changes in the frequencies of light and dark morphs of the peppered moth, ''[[Biston betularia]]'' were direct evidence of natural selection.]]

===Industrial melanism===
{{main|Industrial melanism|Peppered moth evolution}}

Between 1953 and 1956, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]]. He presented results showing that in a polluted urban wood with dark tree trunks, dark moths survived better than pale ones, causing [[industrial melanism]], whereas in a clean rural wood with paler trunks, pale moths survived better than dark ones. The implication was that survival was caused by camouflage against suitable backgrounds, where predators hunting by sight (insect-eating birds, such as the [[great tit]]s used in the experiment) selectively caught and killed the less well-camouflaged moths. The results were intensely controversial, and from 2001 [[Michael Majerus]] carefully repeated the experiment. The results were published posthumously in 2012, vindicating Kettlewell's work as "the most direct evidence", and "one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cook, L.

[[Batesian mimicry]], named for the 19th century naturalist [[Henry Walter Bates]] who first noted the effect in 1861, "provides numerous excellent examples of natural selection"&lt;ref name=Rice2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Stanley A. |title=Encyclopedia of Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA274 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4381-1005-9 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; at work. The evolutionary entomologist [[James Mallet]] noted that [[mimicry]] was "arguably the oldest [[Darwinian]] theory not attributable to Darwin."&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Inspired by ''On the Origin of Species'', Bates realized that unrelated Amazonian butterflies resembled each other when they lived in the same areas, but had different coloration in different locations in the Amazon, something that could only have been caused by adaptation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallet |title=Mimicry: An interface between psychology and evolution |journal=PNAS |date=July 2001 |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=8928–8930 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171326298 |pmid=11481461 |pmc=55348|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.8928M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Müllerian===
{{main|Müllerian mimicry}}

[[Müllerian mimicry]], too, in which two or more distasteful species that share one or more predators have come to mimic each other's warning signals, was clearly adaptive; [[Fritz Müller]] described the effect in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of [[mathematical biology|a mathematical argument]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be.{{efn|If one may ignore, as [[James Mallet|Mallet]] comments, [[Malthus]]'s discussion of the effects of [[population growth]] that influenced Darwin.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Yellow-banded.poison.dart.frog.arp.jpg|upright|thumb|[[aposematic|Warning coloration]] protects poison dart frog ''[[Dendrobates leucomelas]]''.]]

==Aposematism==
{{main|Aposematism}}

In 1867, in a letter to Darwin, Wallace [[Aposematism#Wallace, 1867|described warning coloration]]. The evolutionary zoologist [[James Mallet]] notes that this discovery "rather illogically"&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; followed rather than preceded the accounts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, which both rely on the existence and effectiveness of warning coloration.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{efn|[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] invented the name [[aposematism]] some years later, in 1890, in his book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |date=1890 |title=The Colours of Animals |page=Foldout after page 339|title-link=The Colours of Animals }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The conspicuous colours and patterns of animals with strong defences such as toxins are [[advertising in biology|advertised]] to [[predator]]s, [[honest signalling|signalling honestly]] that the animal is not worth attacking. This directly increases the [[reproductive fitness]] of the potential prey, providing a strong selective advantage.

[[File:Brazilian Skunk from Edward Bagnall Poulton Colours of Animals 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Warning coloration of the "Brazilian Skunk" in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', 1890]]

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', renamed Wallace's concept of warning colours "aposematic" coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim |authorlink=James Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulton's explanations of coloration are emphatically Darwinian. For example, on aposematic colouration he wrote that

{{blockquote|At first sight the existence of this group seems to be a difficulty in the way of the general applicability of the theory of natural selection. Warning Colours appear to benefit the would-be enemies rather than the conspicuous forms themselves, and the origin and growth of a character intended solely for the advantage of some other species cannot be explained by the theory of natural selection. But the conspicuous animal is greatly benefited by its Warning Colours. If it resembled its surroundings like the members of the other class, it would be liable to a great deal of accidental or experimental tasting, and there would be nothing about it to impress the memory of an enemy, and thus to prevent the continual destruction of individuals. The object of Warning Colours is to assist the education of enemies, enabling them to easily learn and remember the animals which are to be avoided. The great advantage conferred upon the conspicuous species is obvious when it is remembered that such an easy and successful education means an education involving only a small sacrifice of life."&lt;ref name=Poulton1890/&gt;&lt;!--end blockquote--&gt;}}

Poulton summed up his allegiance to Darwinism as an explanation of Batesian mimicry in one sentence: "Every step in the gradually increasing change of the mimicking in the direction of specially protected form, would have been an advantage in the struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=Poulton1890&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |date=1890 |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-bagnall-poulton/the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala/1-the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala.shtml |title=The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner |pages=160–161, 220, and whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Peter J. Bowler commented that Poulton used his book to complain about experimentalists' lack of attention to what field naturalists (like Wallace, Bates, and Poulton) could readily see were adaptive features. Bowler added that "The fact that the adaptive significance of coloration ''was'' (sic) widely challenged indicates just how far anti-Darwinian feeling had developed.{{efn|In the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].}} Only field naturalists such as Poulton refused to give in, convinced that their observations showed the validity of selection, whatever the theoretical problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

'''Dessauite-(Y)''' is a mineral member of the crichtonite group with the formula (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;. It is associated with derbylite, hematite, rutile, [[karelianite]], [[siderite]], and [[calcite]]. Founded in the Buca della Vena Mine, Tuscany, Italy, the mineral was called dessauite in honor of professor Gabor Dessau (1907–1983).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Articles_Free/1997/Orlandi_p807-811_97.pdf|title = Dessauite, (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe3+)20O38, a new mineral of the crichtonite group from Buca della Vena mine, Tuscany, Italy.|last = Orlandi|first = Paolo|date = 1997|journal = Journal of the Mineralogical Society of America|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==
Dessauite occurs as small, flattened rhombohedral crystals, tabular {001} with hexagonal outline. Members of the Crichtonite group may be confused with ilmenite or hematite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-29190.html|title = Crichtonite Group|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between dessauite and other minerals in the crichonite group is the occurrence of three additional octahedral sites and of a site in square pyramidal coordination, all with low occupancies. The mineral is black and opaque, presents a metallic luster, and it is brittle. Dessauite presents dimensions of diameter up to 1mm and thickness up to 0.2mm. In reflected plane-polarized light the color is ash-grey with pale bluish tones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The calculated density is 4.68 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The habit is tabular, forming thin dimensions in one direction and hardness of 6.5 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dessauite Mineral Data|url = http://www.webmineral.com/data/Dessauite.shtml#.Vl8dlnarTIU|website = www.webmineral.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dessauite differs from other elements of the crichtonite group because of the quantity of cations and X-ray diffraction pattern.

==Occurrence==
Dessauite was found in the Buca della Vena Mine, Apuan Alps, northern Tuscany, Italy, with many other minerals, coming from hydrothermal fluids circulating through a small hematite-barite ore deposit within dolomite, during an alpine metamorphic event. It occurs in calcite veins hosted within dolomite and is associated with calcite, rutile, hematite, siderite, and derbylite.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32779">The '''disposable soma theory of aging''' states that organisms age due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth, reproduction, and [[DNA repair|DNA repair maintenance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, T. | year = 1977 | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 301–304 | doi=10.1038/270301a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formulated by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or "soma" that it can allocate to its various [[cellular processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gavrilov LA, Gavrilova NS | year = 2002 | title = Evolutionary theories of aging and longevity | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue =2 | pages = 339–356 | doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased [[Cell damage|cellular damage]], [[telomere#shortening|shortened telomeres]], accumulation of [[mutation#harmful mutations|mutations]], compromised [[stem cells]], and ultimately, [[senescence]]. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

== Mechanisms == 
[[File:IGF-1Pathway.png|thumb|The [[IGF-1|IGF-1 pathway]], which represses [[FOXO]], thus preventing [[gene expression]] of longevity-inducing proteins.]]

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">In [[atomic physics]], '''Doppler broadening''' is the broadening of [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]] caused by a distribution of velocities of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s. Different velocities of the [[Spontaneous_emission|emitting]] particles result in different Doppler shifts, the cumulative effect of which is the line broadening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  |title=Lasers
  |author=Siegman, AE
  |year=1986
  |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=1BZVwUZLTkAC&amp;lpg=PA1184&amp;ots=6xdm1N2jLf&amp;dq=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1184#v=onepage&amp;q=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;f=false
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This resulting line profile is known as a '''Doppler profile'''. A particular case is the '''thermal Doppler broadening''' due to the [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal motion]] of the particles. Then, the broadening depends only on the [[frequency]] of the spectral line, the [[mass]] of the emitting particles, and their [[temperature]], and therefore can be used for inferring the temperature of an emitting body.

[[Saturated absorption spectroscopy]], also known as Doppler-free spectroscopy, can be used to find the true frequency of an atomic transition without cooling a sample down to temperatures at which the Doppler broadening is minimal.

== Derivation ==

When thermal motion causes a particle to move towards the observer, the emitted radiation will be shifted to a higher frequency. Likewise, when the emitter moves away, the frequency will be lowered. For non-relativistic thermal velocities, the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] in frequency will be:

:&lt;math&gt;f = f_0\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is the observed frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the rest frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the emitter towards the observer, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

Since there is a distribution of speeds both toward and away from the observer in any volume element of the radiating body, the net effect will be to broaden the observed line. If &lt;math&gt;\,P_v(v)dv&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of particles with velocity component &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,v+dv&lt;/math&gt; along a line of sight, then the corresponding distribution of the frequencies is

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = P_v(v_f)\frac{dv}{df}df&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,v_f = c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity towards the observer corresponding to the shift of the rest frequency &lt;math&gt;\,f_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,f&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = \frac{c}{f_0}P_v\left(c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

We can also express the broadening in terms of the [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Recalling that in the non-relativistic limit &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda-\lambda_{0}}{\lambda_{0}} \approx -\frac{f-f_0}{f_0}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{c}{\lambda_0}P_v\left(c\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

In the case of the thermal Doppler broadening, the velocity distribution is given by the [[Maxwell distribution]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_v(v)dv = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\right)dv&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the emitting particle, &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;\,k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. 

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\left(\frac{c}{f_0}\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{m\left[c\left(\frac{f}{f_0}-1\right)\right]^2}{2kT}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.

We can simplify this expression as

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\sqrt{\frac{mc^2}{2\pi kT {f_0}^2}}\,
\exp\left(-\frac{mc^2\left(f-f_0\right)^2}{2kT {f_0}^2}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;,

which we immediately recognize as a [[Gaussian_function|Gaussian profile]] with the [[standard deviation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{f} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{mc^2}}f_0&lt;/math&gt;

and [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM)

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_{\text{FWHM}} = \sqrt{\frac{8kT\ln 2}{mc^2}}f_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

== Applications and caveats ==

In [[astronomy]] and [[plasma physics]], the thermal Doppler broadening is one of the explanations for the broadening of spectral lines, and as such gives an indication for the temperature of observed material. Other causes of velocity distributions may exist, though, for example due to [[turbulence|turbulent]] motion. For a fully developed turbulence, the resulting line profile is generally very difficult to distinguish from the thermal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Hans R. | last = Griem | year = 1997
 | title = Principles of Plasmas Spectroscopy
 | publisher = University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-45504-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another cause could be a large range of ''macroscopic'' velocities resulting, e.g., from the receding and approaching portions of a rapidly spinning [[accretion disk]]. Finally, there are many other factors which can also broaden the lines. For example, a sufficiently high particle [[number density]] may lead to significant [[Stark broadening]].

Doppler broadening can also be used to determine the velocity distribution of a gas given its absorption spectrum. In particular, this has been used to determine the velocity distribution of interstellar gas clouds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1936MNRAS..96..661B|title = On the interpretation of interstellar lines|last = Beals, C.S.|website = adsabs.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler broadening has also been used as a design consideration in high temperature [[nuclear reactors]]. In principle, as the reactor fuel heats up, the neutron absorption spectrum will broaden due to the relative thermal motion of the fuel atoms with respect to the neutrons. Given the shape of the neutron absorption spectrum, this has the result of reducing [[Neutron cross section|neutron absorption cross section]], reducing the likelihood of absorption and fission. The end result is that reactors designed to take advantage of doppler broadening will decrease their reactivity as temperature increases, creating a [[Passive nuclear safety|passive safety measure]]. This tends to be more relevant to [[Gas-cooled reactor|gas cooled reactors]] as other mechanisms are dominant in [[Light water reactor|water cooled reactors]].

Earth's internal heat budget is fundamental to the [[thermal history of the Earth]].  The '''flow of heat from Earth's interior to the surface''' is estimated at &lt;math&gt;47 \pm 2&lt;/math&gt; [[terawatt]]s (TW)&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010).

== Heat and early estimate of Earth's age ==

Based on calculations of Earth's cooling rate, which assumed constant conductivity in the Earth's interior, in 1862 [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later made Lord Kelvin) estimated the age of the Earth at 98 million years,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William.

''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 23, 157–170.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the age of 4.5 billion years obtained in the 20th century by [[radiometric dating]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. R. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Martin J. van Kranendonk|editor2=Vickie Bennett|editor3=Hugh R.H.

Contrary to the usual representation of Kelvin's argument, the observed thermal gradient of the Earth's crust would not be explained by the addition of radioactivity as a heat source. More significantly, [[mantle convection]] alters how heat is transported within the Earth, invalidating Kelvin's assumption of purely conductive cooling.

== Global internal heat flow ==
[[File:Heat flow of the inner earth.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross section of the Earth showing its main divisions and their approximate contributions to Earth's total internal heat flow to the surface, and the dominant heat transport mechanisms within the Earth.]]

Estimates of the total heat flow from Earth’s interior to surface span a range of 43 to 49 terawatts (TW) (a terawatt is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s).&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;Dye, S. T. (2012). Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth. Reviews of Geophysics, 50(3).&lt;/ref&gt; One recent estimate is 47&amp;nbsp;TW,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; equivalent to an average heat flux of 91.6&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is based on more than 38,000 measurements. The respective mean heat flows of continental and oceanic crust are 70.9 and 105.4&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

While the total internal Earth heat flow to the surface is well constrained, the relative contribution of the two main sources of Earth's heat, radiogenic and primordial heat, are highly uncertain because their direct measurement is difficult. Chemical and physical models give estimated ranges of 15–41&amp;nbsp;TW and 12–30&amp;nbsp;TW for [[radiogenic heat]] and [[primordial heat]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Dye /&gt; 

The [[structure of the Earth]] is a rigid outer [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that is composed of thicker [[continental crust]] and thinner [[oceanic crust]], solid but plastically flowing [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], a liquid [[outer core]], and a solid [[inner core]]. The [[viscosity|fluidity]] of a material is proportional to temperature; thus, the solid mantle can still flow on long time scales, as a function of its temperature&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; and therefore as a function of the flow of Earth's internal heat. The [[Mantle convection|mantle convects]] in response to heat escaping from Earth's interior, with hotter and more buoyant mantle rising and cooler, and therefore denser, mantle sinking. This convective flow of the mantle drives the movement of Earth's [[Lithosphere|lithospheric plates]]; thus, an additional reservoir of heat in the lower mantle is critical for the operation of plate tectonics and one possible source is an enrichment of radioactive elements in the lower mantle.&lt;ref name=Arevalo&gt;Arevalo Jr, R., McDonough, W.

Turcotte|author2=Gerald Schubert|title=Geodynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nCHlVuJ4FoC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=primordial|date=25 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66624-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, about 99% of Earth's internal heat loss at the surface is by conduction through the crust, and mantle convection is the dominant control on heat transport from deep within the Earth. Most of the heat flow from the thicker continental crust is attributed to internal radiogenic sources, in contrast the thinner oceanic crust has only 2% internal radiogenic heat.&lt;ref name=Turcotte /&gt; The remaining heat flow at the surface would be due to basal heating of the crust from mantle convection. Heat fluxes are negatively correlated with rock age,&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt; with the highest heat fluxes from the youngest rock at [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers (zones of mantle upwelling), as observed in the [[:File:Earth heat flow.jpg|global map of Earth heat flow]].&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

== Radiogenic heat ==
[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat-with total.svg|thumb|300px|The evolution of Earth's [[radiogenic heat]] flow over time.]]

The [[radioactive decay]] of elements in the Earth's mantle and crust results in production of daughter [[isotope]]s and release of [[Geoneutrino|geoneutrinos]] and heat energy, or [[radiogenic heat]]. Four radioactive isotopes are responsible for the majority of radiogenic heat because of their enrichment relative to other radioactive isotopes: [[uranium 238|uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[uranium 235|uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K).&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2011"&gt;Korenaga, J. (2011). Earth's heat budget: Clairvoyant geoneutrinos. Nature Geoscience, 4(9), 581–582.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of rock samples from below 200&amp;nbsp;km depth, it is difficult to determine precisely the radiogenic heat throughout the whole mantle,&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2011" /&gt; although some estimates are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-01|title=Geophysical and geochemical constraints on geoneutrino fluxes from Earth's mantle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12006097|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=361|pages=356–366|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.001|issn=0012-821X|arxiv=1207.0853|bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.361..356S}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Earth's core, [[geochemical]] studies indicate that it is unlikely to be a significant source of radiogenic heat due to an expected low concentration of radioactive elements partitioning into iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McDonough|first=W.F.|title=Compositional Model for the Earth's Core|date=2003|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B0080437516020156|work=Treatise on Geochemistry|pages=547–568|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b0-08-043751-6/02015-6|isbn=9780080437514|access-date=2018-08-03|bibcode=2003TrGeo...2..547M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiogenic heat production in the mantle is linked to the structure of [[mantle convection]], a topic of much debate, and it is thought that the mantle may either have a layered structure with a higher concentration of radioactive heat-producing elements in the lower mantle, or small reservoirs enriched in radioactive elements dispersed throughout the whole mantle.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt;

Geoneutrino detectors can detect the decay of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and thus allow estimation of their contribution to the present radiogenic heat budget, while &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is not detectable.  Regardless, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is estimated to contribute 4&amp;nbsp;TW of heating.&lt;ref name="Gando"&gt;Gando, A., Dwyer, D. A., McKeown, R. D., &amp; Zhang, C. (2011). Partial radiogenic heat model for Earth revealed by geoneutrino measurements. Nature Geoscience, 4(9), 647–651.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the short [[Half-life|half-lives]] the decay of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth, which was also much hotter than at present.&lt;ref name=Arevalo /&gt; Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of [[radioactive decay]] from within the Earth, a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for radiogenic heat, yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic,&lt;ref name=Gando /&gt; and this is consistent with previous estimates.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008"&gt;Korenaga, J. (2008). Urey ratio and the structure and evolution of Earth's mantle. Reviews of Geophysics, 46(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primordial heat ==

Primordial heat is the heat lost by the Earth as it continues to cool from its original formation, and this is in contrast to its still actively-produced radiogenic heat. The Earth core's heat flow—heat leaving the core and flowing into the overlying mantle—is thought to be due to primordial heat, and is estimated at 5–15&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name=Lay&gt;Lay, T., Hernlund, J., &amp; Buffett, B. A. (2008). Core–mantle boundary heat flow. Nature Geoscience, 1(1), 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of mantle primordial heat loss range between 7 and 15&amp;nbsp;TW, which is calculated as the remainder of heat after removal of core heat flow and bulk-Earth radiogenic heat production from the observed surface heat flow.&lt;ref name= Dye /&gt;

The early formation of the Earth's dense core could have caused superheating and rapid heat loss, and the heat loss rate would slow once the mantle solidified.&lt;ref name=Lay /&gt; Heat flow from the core is necessary for maintaining the convecting outer core and the geodynamo and [[Earth's magnetic field]], therefore primordial heat from the core enabled Earth's atmosphere and thus helped retain Earth's liquid water.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt;

== Heat flow and plate tectonics ==
[[File:Tectonic evolution of Earth.jpg|thumb|300px|Earth's tectonic evolution over time from a molten state at 4.5&amp;nbsp;Ga,&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. R. 2007"/&gt; to a single-plate lithosphere,&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; to modern [[plate tectonics]] sometime between 3.2&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;ref&gt;Pease, V., Percival, J., Smithies, H., Stevens, G., &amp; Van Kranendonk, M. (2008). When did plate tectonics begin? Evidence from the orogenic record. When did plate tectonics begin on planet Earth, 199–208.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.0&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, R. J. (2008). Modern-style plate tectonics began in Neoproterozoic time: An alternative interpretation of Earth’s tectonic history. When did plate tectonics begin on planet Earth, 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Controversy over the exact nature of mantle convection makes the linked evolution of Earth's heat budget and the dynamics and structure of the mantle difficult to unravel.&lt;ref name="Korenaga 2008" /&gt; There is evidence that the processes of [[plate tectonics]] were not active in the Earth before 3.2 billion years ago, and that early Earth's internal heat loss could have been dominated by [[advection]] via heat-pipe [[volcanism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, W. B., &amp; Webb, A. A. G. (2013). Heat-pipe Earth. Nature, 501(7468), 501–505.&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial bodies with lower heat flows, such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]], [[Thermal conduction|conduct]] their internal heat through a single lithospheric plate, and higher heat flows, such as on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], result in [[advection|advective]] heat transport via enhanced volcanism, while the active plate tectonics of Earth occur with an intermediate heat flow and a [[Mantle convection|convecting mantle]].&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumbnail|right|236px|Earth]]

An overwhelming majority of fiction is set on or features the [[Earth]].  However, authors of [[speculative fiction]] novels and writers and directors of [[science fiction film]] deal with Earth quite differently from authors of conventional fiction.  Unbound from the same ties that bind authors of traditional fiction to the Earth, they can either completely ignore the Earth or use it as but one of many settings in a more complicated universe, exploring a number of common themes through examining outsiders' perceptions of and interactions with Earth.

==Common themes==
{{Prose|date=October 2009}}
*'''Center of the Universe, or the Seat of Power in an [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|Intergalactic]] community'''
**Earth is often depicted as a major power-broker in the community due to [[anthropocentrism]]. Perhaps the most notable example of this is ''[[Star Trek]]'' (where Earth is the capital of the [[United Federation of Planets]]).
**Earth can also be depicted as the head of an empire as in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Dominic Flandry]]'' series where "The barbarians in the long ships waited at the edge of the Galaxy for the ancient [[Terran Empire]] to fall … The brilliant Starship Commander Flandry fought to save the empire even as he scorned it" (from the preface to ''The Rebel Worlds'').
**[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Darkover]]'' series, too, has a brooding Terran Empire maintaining a colonial enclave on the planet Darkover where the plot takes place, and on countless others.
**''[[Haegemonia: Legions of Iron]]'' also features an empire controlled from Earth with other major planets, such as Eden IV.
**It is a common theme across British science fiction to have Earth near the core, or center of the fictional universe{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, common examples could be the works of [[Peter F. Hamilton]] where earth is the main terminus of the wormhole and the capital of the inner worlds (in later works he turns the idea that people seek an inner [[Human migration|migration]] (as opposed to an external expansion) to [[frontier]] type worlds).
**In the [[BBC]] science fiction show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', many episodes set in the future depict Earth as being the head of an empire that stretches across many galaxies.
** In the [[Warhammer 40,000]] franchise, Earth is referred to as "Holy Terra" and is the capital of the Imperium of Man
*'''Invasion by [[alien invasion|Aliens]].'''
{{See also|:Category:Alien invasions in fiction}}
:*While reasons vary, in most stories, it is because extraterrestrials are looking for a new world to colonize or otherwise dominate. The aliens are often used to portray nearly all-powerful beings, placing the strongest forces on Earth at the receiving end of attacks that they can barely understand. This theme is one of the earliest in science fiction, demonstrated by [[H. G. Wells]] in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and Doctor Who, where the invasions in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s are small scale, and the invasions from the 1990s and later are more-large scale, in works such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. In such scenarios, the author often uses [[deus ex machina]] to allow the invasion to be repulsed. In others, like ''[[Footfall]]'' and ''[[Worldwar]]'', the author depicts aliens only slightly more advanced than the inhabitants of Earth, and are fought to a stand-still or defeated in battle. The opposite has also been depicted, with Earth becoming a refuge to aliens as seen in the ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' series of movies, and ''[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|Alien Nation]]'' series.
*'''Forgotten or mythical'''
**The memory of Earth, and its location may be lost to the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]] or shrouded in myth as mankind abandons the Earth. [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' and ''[[Galactic Empire (series)|Empire]]'' series depict a common theme of a destroyed Earth. In other works, such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', it is largely forgotten except by the religious. In the numerous books of the [[Dumarest saga|''Dumarest'' saga]] by [[E.C. Tubb]], the adventurer protagonist was born on a "galactic backwater" Earth and at a young age had stowed away on a rare spaceship touching down on the planet; having seen more than enough of the galaxy he wants to go back, but no one else had ever heard of the planet. The first Terran inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector are Earth-born criminals in [[sleeper ship]]s in ''[[StarCraft]]''. The expansion also mentions about Earth: upon hearing of the United Earth Directorate's forces' arrival, Zeratul remarks "Raynor [a [[wikt:Terran#Adjective|Terran]] captain] spoke to me of the distant Terran homeworld of Earth." This implies that the Terrans still know about Earth but its location is lost (''StarCraft'' manual mentions that the sleeper ships have become lost in hyperspace when an error erased the intended destination's coordinates, as well as those of Earth's, resulting in the ships going at full speed for several decades until the engines broke down). Also, the Terran Confederacy uses the same flag as the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]]. Also, in the [http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html Zodiac] series by Romina Russell, it states that "history tells us the original human colonizers came from a distant and long-gone planet called Earth, and they traveled through a portal in Helios to get here—but the portal is just another myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html|title=Zodiac Beginnings|last=Russell|first=Romina|date=14 February 2017|website=Zodiac Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Destruction'''
{{See also|:Category:Apocalyptic fiction}}
:*Earth could have been completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, but its location (or at least its former location) is well known. This last scenario is also popular, and was featured in the movie ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', as well as in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. There is an example of a devastated uninhabitable Earth in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1973 novel ''[[To Die in Italbar]]''.
*'''Not mentioned'''
**Some works, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and many [[fantasy]] works, never mention the Earth at all (although a proposed novel, [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s ''[[Alien Exodus]]'', would have linked Earth to the ''Star Wars'' universe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwriter.com/alienout.htm George Lucas's ''Monsters and Aliens'', Volume 1: ''Alien Exodus'' — Outline by Robert J. Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In some ''Star Wars'' works, Earth (also known as Urthha) exist, such as the ''Star Wars''-''[[Indiana Jones]]'' non-canonical comic strip ''Into the Great Unknown'' (published in ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'' #19), in the also non-canonical Disney's ''[[Star Tours|Star Tours: The Adventure Continue]]'' ride, in other two non-canonical works, and in ''Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas''.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the author to operate in a realm unfamiliar and otherworldly to the reader or to explore contentious issues and historical themes in an otherwise entirely alien environment, giving the work a radically different perspective. In the ''[[Homeworld]]'' games for example, Earth's existence is unknown – and indeed entirely immaterial – as the games take place in a different galaxy altogether (specifically the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]]). However, judging by the appearance of members of the Kushan/Hiigaran people, most notably Karan S'jet, Hiigaran biology is at least outwardly similar, if not identical, to human biology.

==Earth as presented in various works==
* In the [[H. G. Wells]] story ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', perhaps the first depiction of an alien invasion in fiction, Earth is simply a neighboring planet of the inhabitants of Mars. With their world coming into its end, they target the younger and richer Earth for migration. This plot is repeated with varying degrees of differences in many of its adaptations, but Earth's place largely remains the same. The notable exception is in the television series ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'', where the aliens look to Earth for more specific reasons, as it features many of their old world's characteristics (such as both being the third planet in their respective systems, the number 3 playing a large role in their beliefs).
* ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]'' - ''[[Earth]]'' is the home to the UNSA (United Nations Space Alliance) and Earth is attacked by the Settlement Defense Front, resulting in Earth's defenses compromised.
* In the [[anime]] series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', Earth has become a backwater wasteland after a horrific accident caused one of the jumpgates that humans used to travel the Solar System to explode, destroying part of the Moon and causing the destroyed bits to rain down on the Earth.
* The ''[[Gundam]]'' anime often depicts a war between Earth against the [[space colonization|space colonies]] established by humans in [[outer space]].
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'', Earth (known as [[Thulcandra]]) is part of the [[Field of Arbol]]: and is the subject of an interplanetary [[blockade]] — hence its name, the Silent Planet.
* In ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', [[Tuxedo Mask]] protects Earth and holds the Golden Crystal.
* In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', Earth has been united into a single geopolitical entity, [[The World State]].
* In [[David Weber]]'s ''[[Honorverse]]'', Earth is the capital planet of the [[Solarian League]], the largest and wealthiest political institution ever created by man. Prior to the League's creation, a large portion of humanity departed for other planets and solar systems in what came to be known as the [[Diaspora]], leaving those who remained to rebuild from the effects of pollution, resource exhaustion, and the cataclysmic Final War. They did so, and Earth once again became the political, economic, and cultural center of humanity.
* The Earth also plays a major part in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' universe. It is where humans come from and expand out of to create numerous Empires, being invaded by many different aliens through all of its history. Having a weather control station on the moon by 2070, by the year 200,000, the Earth is in the middle of the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. By the year 5,000,000,000, humanity is spread all across the stars and has fully integrated themselves with the rest of the universe. Shortly after the destruction of Earth, Humanity regroups and colonized a new planet, naming it New Earth. Humans go to live on to the end of the Universe.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' Earth, known as Terra ([[Latin]] for Earth), is the home world of Humanity and the capital of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium of Man]]. By the 41st Millennium, it has become an [[ecumenopolis]]. It is the site of the Golden Throne, where the God-Emperor resides. Its soil is utterly barren and its atmosphere is a fog of pollution. Massive, labyrinthine edifices sprawl across the vast majority of the surface. Its oceans have long ago boiled away. Many mountain ranges have been leveled, perhaps all but the Himalayas, due to the laboratories said to be underneath and the Astronomican that lays within them. Beneath hundreds of layers of urban accretion, catacombs hold older cultures, completely different from the surface ones. A poor civilization lives and dies, without ever seeing the surface. A square meter of land on Terra costs more than a palace on any Hive World; only the most wealthy can even afford to own a small section of land.
* In the [[Noon Universe]], [[Earth (Noon Universe)|Earth]] is a Utopian world of immense power and the initial home planet of all [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]] scattered over the Universe.
* In the alternate future universe of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', Earth has been divided into two twin worlds — technology-driven [[Stark (The Longest Journey)|Stark]], the world as we know it, and the magic world of [[Arcadia (The Longest Journey)|Arcadia]] for over 13 millennia.
* In [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'', [[The Stainless Steel Rat]] travels to Earth, 1975, and then to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] France, to stop a madman known as He from destroying the timeline.  The Rat and his contemporaries in the series show confusion over the name of the world, hedging by calling it either "Earth" or "Dirt".
* In the animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Earth is the center of the Homeworlds, the core of both Human and Neosapien Empires (at different times).
* In the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' film series, Earth is still the main home of humanity even though humans have begun to colonise other worlds. It is also the HQ of the ruthless [[megacorp]]oration "[[Weyland-Yutani]]". Nothing is seen of the planet itself in the primary four ''Alien'' films, with the exception of shots of the planet from orbit, and some shots of Paris in the special edition of ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' which depicts the city as a ruined, possibly post-holocaust landscape. By the time of ''Resurrection'', which is set in the 24th century, Earth as a whole is considered to be an unpleasant, polluted planet that even hardened mercenaries prefer to avoid. Upon learning of their impending arrival there, Johner (one of the film's character portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]]) remarks "Earth, man...what a shithole."
* The television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' differs from the usual portrayal of Earth as a dominant power in galactic civilization. The series' [[Systems Commonwealth]] was founded thousands of years in the past by the [[Vedran]] species in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], with Earth joining in the 22nd century. Humans go on to become a major player in the Commonwealth, but Earth itself has no special importance (although the final two episodes of the series [[retcon]] this). Following the fall of the Commonwealth, Earth becomes one of many [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]] slave worlds. Earth was eventually liberated, but the [[Spirit of the Abyss]] destroyed the planet.
* In the video game universe of ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', Earth is the center of all human government, military and technology. Earth and its colonies are governed by the UNSC, or the [[United Nations Space Command]]. During the Human–Covenant War, the Cole Protocol was implemented, stating that ships must self-destruct rather than let the Covenant find the location of Earth. Furthermore, any ship heading to Earth must take several random slipspace jumps rather than head straight for it. On October 20, 2552, Earth was attacked by the Covenant and successfully defended by the UNSC Military after a month-long battle.
* In the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, Earth is ruled by a [[fascism|fascistic]] government called the [[United Earth Directorate]]. When the UED becomes aware of the presence of aliens hostile to humanity in the far away Koprulu Sector, it sends a large [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] to defeat the aliens, conquer the sector, and reintegrate the banished [[Terran (StarCraft)|human colonists]] who reside there into its political fold. The Directorate's initial progress in the sector was promising, as it managed to invade and conquer the main planets of both the [[Terran Dominion]] and the bizarre alien [[Zerg]], in the process kidnapping the [[Zerg Overmind]] and using it to control most of the Zerg swarms. The rogue Zerg leader [[Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] waged a clever and highly successful war to rid the sector of the Earth's control, aided in part by temporary Terran and Protoss allies. The end result for Earth's forces was a crushing defeat which amounted to the loss of all ships in the Koprulu Sector. As of the events of ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'', there remain a few isolated pockets of UED fleet survivors scattered throughout the Koprulu sector. It is unclear if the UED is planning to return to the war-torn area.
* In author [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'', Earth is the heart of an economical empire, its biosphere wrecked by global warming to such an extent that any unfortified structure would be torn apart in a matter of days by colossal, super-sized versions of modern tropical hurricanes. The entire sprawling human population is forced to live in arcologies protected against the so-called "Armada Storms". Whilst Earth represents a significant political and industrial power base, it is nonetheless an independent state and not the head of the series' [[Confederation]]. Physically, Earth is dominated by massive Arcologies that cover most of the major urban centers of our time, including London, New York and [[Johannesburg]]. There are also several equatorial [[space elevator]]s that allow for transit into orbit, where the planet is surrounded by an ''[[Gerard K. O'Neill|O'Neill]] Halo'', a collection of captured asteroids providing habitation and raw materials as well as docking and strategic defense units. Earth is sometimes referred to as "The fortress world" due to the enormous fleet of space warship's surrounding it in order to protect the vital industrial facilities of the ''O'Neill Halo''.
* In the [[Metroid (series)|''Metroid'' series]], Samus's birthplace K-2L was a colony of Earth.  However at the formation of the Galactic Federation, in the year 2000 C.C. (Cosmic Calendar), it can be assumed that Earth's resources were absorbed into the federation.
* In the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' universe, Earth is the capital of the [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]], which spends much of the time period covered in the published media (from the middle to the end of the 27th century) locked in an interstellar war with the [[Kilrathi Empire]]. The Confederation was founded in the aftermath of the collapse of the World Economic Consortium.
* In the ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' series, Earth is much as in the real world until Rhodan, that Earth's first man on the moon, discovers a wrecked starship from the ancient Arkonide Empire. Using the technology and the help of the surviving Arkonides, Rhodan forces the Earth to unite under his leadership, and begins to explore the galaxy while carefully concealing the location of Earth from enemies such as the Arkonide Empire. Later in the series, Earth under the now-immortal Rhodan becomes a major player in the universe, establishing a benevolent empire. During an invasion of the Milkyway by the ''Laren'', Earth and the Moon with its 20 billion inhabitants are supposed to be teleported to a different system, but accidentally end up in the bridge between two collided galaxies (called ''Maelstrom of Stars'') and moved into orbit about a star. 120 years later the system falls into a giant energy vortex and is again transported to another galaxy, and most of the humans in it become part of the ''superintelligence IT''. Another five years later, IT transports Earth and Moon back into the Solar System, and they are repopulated.
* In the anime and manga series ''[[Trigun]]'' it is revealed that through constant pollution and humanity living beyond its means that the Earth had to be evacuated after becoming uninhabitable. The humans fled in cryogenic suspension with only a small skeleton crew operating their fleet called Project Seeds to search for a new homeworld. Upon crashing on the planet Gunsmoke, any advanced technology from the days of Earth is referred to as lost technology.
* In Phillip Reeves's ''[[Mortal Engines Quartet]]'' (known as the ''Hungry City Chronicles'' in the US), Earth has been ravaged by a conflict known as the Sixty Minute War, which was soon followed by earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a brief ice age, leaving Earth forever changed. Europe is known as the "Great Hunting Ground" as where most [[Traction Cities]] are found, North America is known as the "Dead Continent" and South America's [[isthmus]] has been cut off due to 'Slow Bombs'.
* In Dan Simmons's ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' series, Old Earth is believed to have been destroyed by ''The Big Mistake of '08'' (in which a miniature black hole was dropped into it), but later shown to have been spirited away by 'other' beings of godlike abilities and consciousness.
* In the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' film, astronauts attempt to leave the [[Solar System]] for the first time, aiming for [[Alpha Centauri]]. However, unexplained phenomena cause their small vessel to change course while the crew is in [[cryopreservation|cryostasis]]. They wake upon landing on an inhabitable but harsh planet that they later learn is a future Earth, dominated by sapient [[ape]]s. However, in the original [[Pierre Boulle]] novel and the [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|2001 film]], both of the same name, the astronauts find civilizations of apes on another planet, but suffer a rude shock upon returning to Earth, finding it besieged by apes.
* In the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' series of [[first-person shooter]]s, a modern-day research facility opens a portal storm between Earth and the border world Xen. The portal storm floods the planet with aliens from that world, and is kept open by a creature named [[Nihilanth]]. A scientist named [[Gordon Freeman]] manages to reach the creature and take it down, unknowingly freeing one of the races that traveled to Earth by the portal storms. The portal storm awakes the Combine Empire, which then manages to conquer Earth in just seven hours, after its military had been crippled by beings from Xen. Two decades after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon Freeman succeeds in cutting Earth off of the Combine Empire and a device that suppressed human reproduction, leading to a renewed fight between the native population and the trapped Combine forces.
* In the [[massively multiplayer online game]] ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'', Earth is shown in the near future as having been attacked by a force known as the Bane. Hopelessly outmatched, it is revealed that Earth's various governments haven't been caught completely off guard and rather than mount a suicidal defense, have chosen to abandon the planet using wormhole portals built using alien technology to evacuate as many people as they could to other planets so the human race can regroup and launch a counterattack at the Bane. The ultimate fate of Earth, and those that were left behind, was unknown, with many thinking it was lost forever. It was later discovered Earth had been conquered and converted into a large staging area for the Bane which left the planet in bad shape.
* In the video game ''[[Xenosaga]]'', the Earth has been abandoned by humanity for at least 4,000 years, because the Earth has disappeared altogether from physical space. Humans refer to the planet as "Lost Jerusalem".
* In the video game ''[[FreeSpace]]'' Earth serves as the capital of the Galactic Terran Alliance. During the war against the Shivans, a last-ditch attack in subspace saves the planet from destruction, but at the cost of collapsing the [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] node that allows access to the system. By the end of ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'', Earth is still sealed off and has had no contact with the outside systems for 32 years, but the Alliance is hopeful they have found a way to restore travel to the Sol system.
* In the ''[[AT-43]]'' universe, Earth, known as "Sol III" was the home planet of the humans who became the Therian faction. In this future, Earth was destroyed (after the Therians recklessly used up its resources) and the debris was used to form a [[Dyson sphere]] around the [[Sun]].
* In ''[[Little Fuzzy]]'', Earth is referred to as Terra, and is the center of a multi-planetary system, spanning many galaxies most likely.
* In the ''[[Funky Koval]]'' comic series, most events take place on 2080s Earth which is very similar to our own. However it is rather ruled by global corporations (Stellar Fox Syndicate is notable example) than political bodies like UN. Earth is also on the verge of wide galactic explorations with possess ion of subspace flight technology and maintain contact with at least two alien species: The Droll and Ancusans.
* In the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' manga, Mamoru Chiba is the representative of Earth taking the place of a Sailor Soldier and becoming Tuxedo Kamen. (Tuxedo Mask)
* In the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series of video games, Earth is the industrial, economic and cultural capital of the human Systems Alliance; however, the military and political capital is at [[Arcturus]], 36 light years from Earth. As of 2183, when the game is set, Earth is looked upon as a near Utopian world, for it has been mentioned that Earth has reached a "New Golden Age". However, there is still violent weather due to environmental damages of the 21st century. But since developing faster-than-light travel among other advanced technologies, there have been  significant improvements to the state of the planet. The Systems Alliance itself is regarded as a sleeping giant, and humanity has quickly established itself as one of the most important and powerful races in the galaxy. Earth, like a number of other planets in the Mass Effect series, is attacked at the onset of the Reaper War and suffers catastrophic damage due to it being the focal point of the war, resulting in huge losses of life and many cities left in ruins, though it is implied that Earth is subsequently repaired in time.
* In his work ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', French author [[Jules Verne]] presented the concept of a hollow center of the planet inhabited by prehistoric beings. The secrets of this region were explored by a group of travelers from the surface.
* In the science fiction novel ''The Last Train out of Existence'' by Volarion Wendsar, Earth is described as having reached a period of societal stagnation thanks to the development of 'holographic cellular phones'. The Earth continues to remain in this indefinite state of stagnation until a fleet commandeered by an admiral known as Kress Milligan commits a nuclear genocide against the humans of Earth, most of whom are obliterated. The government of the galaxy, the Galactic Ascendancy, forbids any travel to and from the Earth and its star system, and quells any attempts at violating this, including destroy the ship of archaeologist Arord Trialens before he can reach the surface to conduct an expedition.

===''Battlestar Galactica''===
The overarching plot in both the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]] and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' is the quest to find Earth, which is thought to be the location of the lost thirteenth colony of [[Kobol]]. Colonial history dictates that [[Kobol]] is the homeworld of all humanity, and that the Thirteen Tribes of Kobol fled that world thousands of years earlier, with twelve tribes founding the Twelve Colonies and the thirteenth heading to Earth. Both shows are similar in that the location of Earth is initially unknown, but clues to its location are gradually discovered by the refugee fleet from the [[Twelve Colonies]]. In both series, the exodus of the Thirteen Tribes took place so far in the past that most modern Colonials have come to assume that the stories of Earth are simply religious myths.

====Original series====
In the original series, several clues indicate that the existence of Earth is real. On the prison planet of Proteus, [[Lieutenant Starbuck|Starbuck]] encounters drawings of star systems on the wall of a cell once occupied by a mysterious prisoner. The star charts turn out to be that of the [[Solar System]]. Additionally, when the ''Galactica'' later reaches a planet called Terra, it is inhabited by humans who use Earth units of measurement (hours, minutes, etc.) rather than Colonial units of measurement, suggesting that it was settled by members of the lost Thirteenth Tribe thousands of years earlier on their way to Earth.

In ''[[Galactica 1980]]'', a continuation of the original series, the fleet did eventually discover Earth as it was in 1980.

====Re-imagined series====
In the Season Three finale of the re-imagined series, [[Kara Thrace]] returns to ''Galactica'' after her apparent death, claiming to have been to Earth and intending to lead the fleet there. The camera then pans out from the fleet to view the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and then zooms back in to show Earth, confirming the existence of the planet. In the Season Four mid-season finale episode "Revelations", the fleet finally reaches Earth, only to discover that it is a lifeless, radioactive wasteland.

In "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", it is revealed that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of humanoid and mechanical Cylons of a type previously unknown. It is also revealed that the final five Cylons had previously lived on Earth 2000 years in the past, when a [[nuclear war]] devastated the planet.

In the final episode, a [[twist ending]] shows ''Galactica'' reaching our Earth, 150,000 years ago. The Colonials and the Cylons they've made peace with decide to call their new world "Earth" due to the hope associated with the name of the now devastated planet the Thirteenth Tribe once inhabited. They then abandon their technology and live among the new Earth's native [[Hominini]]. 150,000 years later, in the present day, the remains of [[Mitochondrial Eve]] – a Colonial human/Cylon hybrid (named [[Hera Agathon]]) whose birth and destiny had been a major plot element of the series – are discovered.

===''Buck Rogers''===
In most variations on the ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' mythos (comic strip, TV series, feature film), Earth of the 25th century (where the action takes place) is recovering from various atomic wars, usually variations on [[World War III]]. In the original comic, [[Mongols]] have taken over the Earth; in the [[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|TV series]], the Draconian Empire fills this role (although the Draconians are obviously based on Mongols). Most of Earth's cities lie in ruins, although rebuilding is in progress (Earth's capital is New Chicago; other cities include New Paris, New London etc.). The second season of the TV series revealed that much of Earth's population fled the planet in the wake of the atomic war and founded colonies in deep space; the Earth ship ''Searcher'' is dispatched to investigate.

===''Buffyverse''===
In [[Joss Whedon]]'s [[Buffyverse]], established by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', Earth is one of several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]; the term "Earth" is used both to refer to the specific planet and to the dimension the planet exists in as a whole. Born from the Seed of Wonder, the source of all [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], Earth originated as a world of [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Demons]], and was ruled over by the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]] during a time known as the Primordium Age. Eventually, however, the human race rose up and fought back against the Old Ones, banishing them to other dimensions.

===''CoDominium''===
In [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s ''[[CoDominium]]'' series (now largely [[alternate history]]) the Earth comes under the control of the CoDominium, an alliance between the United States and [[Soviet Union]], in the year 1990. The CoDominium imposes its control over all other nations of the Earth, halting scientific development and warfare. The CoDominium is ruled by a Grand Senate located on the Moon, and eventually constructs interstellar colonies for the joint goal of economic gain and a means of exiling troublesome elements of society. Eventually in 2103, the CoDominium dissolves, with the US and USSR engaging in the nuclear "Great Patriotic Wars" which destroy almost all of Earth (it is mentioned that [[Jamaica]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean Alps]] are untouched).

The CD Space Navy escapes to the planet Sparta, which eventually becomes the nucleus of the "Empire of Man". During the Empire's Formation Wars the Earth is once more hit hard, but is eventually incorporated into the Imperium as the "honorary capital." When the Empire dissolves in the Secession Wars in the 27th century, Earth is once more subjected to nuclear attacks, but by the early 31st century has been reclaimed by the Second Empire. By that time, the Earth city of "New Annapolis" is a training center for the Imperial Space Navy. To inhabitants of planets newly contacted, such as [[CoDominium#Planets of the CoDominium and the Empire of Man|Prince Samual's World]] in "[[King David's Spaceship]]", the condition of the still largely desolate Earth is presented as an object lesson for the prohibitive price of war and a justification for Empire's claim to universal rule.

===''Dragon Ball''===
In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series, Earth is the primary setting and one of many planets in the North Galaxy. The planet is inhabited by humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, and demons, among others. ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s Earth features heavy [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]], such as [[humanoid robot]]s and flying cars, as well as heavy magical influence.

===''Dune''===
In [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series of novels, [[Earth]] is referred to as ''Old Earth / Old Terra'' by the time of the original novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (at least 21,500 years in the future). The [[Sun]] is called Al-Lat, and humanity had populated many planets (among them [[Caladan]], [[Giedi Prime]] and [[Salusa Secundus]]). In the time of [[Paul Atreides]], the Earth is an uninhabited and largely forgotten land, shrouded in legend. In ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', Paul refers to [[Hitler]] and [[Genghis Khan]], in comparing the destructiveness of his [[Jihad]] to their wars. It is a wilderness and recovering an ecosystem of its own as humans have abandoned it. The artifacts of ''Homo sapiens'' have for the most part crumbled back into the planet, though a more than casual observer can find many traces of the old civilizations.

Paul's son, the God Emperor [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]], refers to the Earth many times in his journals. The God Emperor seemed particularly fond of the ancestors he had from the Western sections of [[Eurasia]]. He makes references to [[Israel]], [[Urartu]], (also called [[Armenia]]), [[Edom]], [[Damascus]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Babylon]], [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]], [[Umlias]], the plains of Central Asia, and the [[Greeks]]; the [[House Atreides#Relationship to Greek mythology|family name]] refers to their descent from [[Atreus]]. He seems to have had ancestors among the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] or the [[Mongols]] as he says that one of his memories involves a horse plain with felt [[yurt]]s. Leto also has the memories of a famous politician from the United States whose name was [[Jacob Broom]]. In the book Children of Dune, Leto II mentions an ancestor named [[Agamemnon]], and makes reference to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.

In ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', it is noted that the [[Bene Gesserit]] Mother Superior [[List of Dune Bene Gesserit#Taraza|Taraza]] has the preserved [[Vincent van Gogh]] painting ''[[Thatched Cottages at Cordeville|Cottages at Cordeville]]'' hanging in her room.

In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], set in the Dune universe, it is revealed that at the beginning of mankind's war with the Machines, called the [[Butlerian Jihad]], Earth had been devastated by humans themselves using [[atomics (Dune)|atomics]] in an attack on the Machines. In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] series, also by Herbert and Anderson, it is mentioned that certain [[Claude Monet|Monet]] and [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] paintings are owned by [[House Vernius]], and hang in the Grand Palais at [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]].

===''Firefly''===
In the [[Joss Whedon]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', Earth is long since abandoned. It is referred to with awe as "Earth-that-Was", having been abandoned centuries ago due to overpopulation and depletion of the planet's natural resources. After fleeing the planet, the remnants of humanity traveled in [[generation ship]]s for decades (many humans lived their entire lives within a spaceship's walls) until finding a new star system. Collection of Earth-that-Was artifacts is a hobby for the rich, and ancient Earth artifacts are known to be very valuable.

It is unknown whether Earth has actually been destroyed, or if the planet still physically exists; in the feature film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', ancient starships are shown leaving a sickly brown Earth with gray oceans, but the fate of the planet is never fully revealed. A puppet show in the episode "[[Heart of Gold (Firefly)|Heart of Gold]]" implies that Earth has in fact been obliterated, but this was never actually confirmed on screen.

===''Asimov's future histories''===
In much of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fiction, the [[Earth (Foundation universe)|future Earth]] is an underprivileged planet — impoverished, overcrowded and disease-ridden — which is regarded with disdain by the arrogant [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacers]] of the "Outer Planets" (at this stage, there are about fifty of them).

In the [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the inhabitants of these planets are still aware that their ancestors came from Earth, but this does not make them fond of the place. Rather, they develop a racist theory by which "the best strains" had left Earth to colonize the other planets and left "the inferior strains" behind. However, they have no choice but to ask the help of the protagonist, a detective from the despised Earth, to solve murder mysteries which baffle their own police. Afterwards, Earth embarks on a major new campaign of space colonization, with the hope that the new colonists will prove more faithful to the Mother Planet than the earlier ones. However, in the end of the series, the Earth is doomed to a slow radioactive process that will leave the planet uninhabitable, causing a more rapid expansion of colonization from Earth.

In the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Galactic Empire'' series]], taking place thousands of years later (originally conceived as completely separate but made by Asimov in his later career into the direct sequel of the Robot Period), Earth and settlements from it are still clearly remembered in ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]]''. By the time of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'', Earth is ruled by Trantor, not yet a Galactic Empire. Its status as the original homeworld of humanity is now disputed.

In ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', we see Earth in the early days of the Empire of [[Trantor]]. Earth has a largely radioactive crust with only patches of habitable land in between, and its people have to undergo compulsory [[euthanasia]] at the age of 60. It is a backwater province, and among inhabitants of other planets there is a prevalent prejudice known as "Anti-Terrestrialism", (obviously modeled on [[antisemitism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}), with the main negative stereotype having to do with the radiation-induced diseases prevalent on Earth.

By this time, Earth people still believe themselves to be the original home of Humanity, but hardly anyone else shares this belief. Fanatical priests, based in a mysterious Temple erected on the ruins of Washington, D.C., cultivate the mystique of Earth's ancient glories and conceive a plot to spread a Terrestrial disease throughout the Galaxy and in this way take over the Empire (and incidentally, act out the stereotype). The plot is foiled by a middle-aged tailor from the Twentieth Century, who possess powerful psychic abilities as a result of experiments performed upon him when he arrived in the future.  Schwartz, the tailor, is often described as being Jewish, though this is never stated within the novel.

By the time of the Galactic Empire's decline, [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] is vaguely remembered as 'Sol' in ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', and only one candidate for being the Original World.  In ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', records of Earth are missing, so two citizens of the mature Foundation go looking for it, and eventually find that it is desolated by nuclear radiation.  The only sentient being remaining in the Solar system is robot Daneel Olivaw, who resides in a small station on the moon, overseeing the progress of a humanity now spread throughout the galaxy.

===''Hainish Cycle''===
In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Hainish Cycle]] our Earth is referred to as Terra. Like all [[Planets of the Hainish Cycle|human worlds of the Hainish Cycle]], Terra was populated by the humans of Hain in Earth's prehistory, but forgot our common ancestry after millennia of no contact from extraterrestrial humans after the collapse of the first Hainish interplanetary civilization.

The second period of contact with the interstellar Hainish community, now organized as "The League Of All Worlds" is described in ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', and ''[[Rocannon's World]]''. In ''The Dispossessed'', Terra's population is said to have fallen from 9 billion to only half a billion people due to a collapse of the Terran ecology, and that life has only survived there because of strict rationing of resources and help from the Hainish. In ''The Word for World Is Forest'', the people from Terra appear as reckless exploiters of other planets. Some time later, ''[[City of Illusions]]'' provides a detailed description of Terra in the depths of a second era of isolation, called "The Age Of The Enemy".

The post-apocalyptic Earth seen in ''City of Illusions'' shows signs of an advanced, abandoned civilization under a rewilded landscape. A small number of humans live in tiny, isolated settlements where they retain some technologies from the past but are completely cut off from any communication with neighboring regions or with other worlds. There is only one city with high technology and energy-intensive construction, and it is controlled by the alien conquerors of the League. The events of ''City of Illusions'' lead to the third period of Terran contact with other worlds, this time as the Ekumen, during which ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' takes place.

In the short story "Dancing To Ganam," which takes place in the far future of the Hainish universe, it is said that an extreme religious movement called the Unists developed on Terra and engaged in mass slaughter of non-believers and then of rival Unists sects. It is described as "the worst resurgence of theocratic violence since the Time of Pollution". It unclear if this time of pollution refers to the [[ecological collapse]] described in ''The Dispossesed,'' the collapse seen in ''City Of Illusions'', or is another unexplored dark period on Terra. In any case, the inclusion of this story is meant to show that even after so many millennia in the League and the Ekumen, Terra is still in many ways culturally primitive and prone to violent self-destruction.

Various individuals from Terra play a part in other stories. In ''[[The Telling]]'', Terra's incorporation into the Ekumen is briefly explained. Also, the main character in ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' is from Terra.

===''Hitchhiker's Guide''===
In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]], the [[Earth (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Earth]] is destroyed by a Vogon Constructor Fleet to make room for a hyperspace bypass.  One of two surviving Earthmen, [[Arthur Dent]], is affronted and dismayed to find that his planet's entry in the Guide consists of one word: "Harmless".  [[Ford Prefect]], a researcher for the Guide attempts (and fails) to placate him by informing him that he has written a more extensive article for the next edition, although the result of merciless editing of his original draft has reduced his version considerably, now reading "Mostly harmless".  Dent also learns that the Earth was originally constructed by the inhabitants of the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], as a giant supercomputer built to find the Question to [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|the Ultimate Answer of Life, The Universe and Everything]].  The computer was so large that it was often mistaken for a planet, and that it was destroyed five minutes before the program was due to complete (after ten million years of running).  It also mentions that humans are descended from the passengers of an ark full of unwanted middlemen (hairdressers, telephone sanitizers, advertising executives and the like), tricked into leaving their own planet behind by spurious tales of impending destruction invented by the rest of the planet's civilization (it is mentioned that the population was then wiped out by a disease contracted from a dirty telephone).  The Earth was located in Galactic sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.  An alternate version of Earth is the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#NowWhat|NowWhat]], which occupies the same space as Earth, but not the same probability. In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|2005 film adaptation]], a new Earth replaces the old one, and everything is restored to the moments leading up to its destruction, except for one thing: Arthur Dent is not part of the planet anymore, at his own request.

===''Red Dwarf''===
In the series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', Earth is seen mainly as the goal of the crew's trip; [[Dave Lister]] is personally obsessed with revisiting it as his home world, especially since he is the only character to be from there as [[Arnold Rimmer]] was born on [[Io (moon)|Io]]. The novel ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' mentions the Earth, despite Lister's regard for it, as suffering from massive littering and environmental damage; with a giant [[toupee]] being installed to in order to cover up [[ozone depletion]]. The novel ''[[Better Than Life]]'', however, mentions Earth being voted out of inhabitability to be the solar system's chosen planet of refuse known as Garbage World. A [[methane]] build up "farts" the planet out of the system and sends it out into deep space where it becomes an ice planet; later moved and thawed by the actions of the crew of ''Red Dwarf''. The Earth is inhabited by giant [[cockroach]]es and the descendants of [[GELF]]s sent there as punishment for their rebellion and bred into the [[GELF#The Polymorph|polymorph]]. Lister spends half a lifetime trapped there attempting to correct his species past actions before ''Red Dwarf'' can rescue him due to [[black hole]] [[time dilation]]. In ''[[Last Human]]'' a parallel Earth is doomed by the initiatives of Earth President John Milhous [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and humanity breeds GELFs and [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|simulants]] to terraform a new home across the multi-[[dimension]]al omni-zone.

===''Stargate''===
In the ''[[Stargate]]'' television series, Earth (designation: ''P2X-3YZ'') is described as one of countless inhabited worlds, and is revealed to be the original home world of humans all over the galaxy. In ancient history many groups of humans were kidnapped and enslaved by powerful alien races, primarily the [[Goa'uld]]. Others remained to form present day Earth societies, which interact covertly with other extraterrestrial races and civilizations, many of them human. Earth first became important in the scene after the [[Alterans]] occupied it as their new capital (its name was Terra at that point). When they were forced to relocate to Lantea in the Pegasus galaxy (several million years ago), they "seeded" the planet with a less advanced form of themselves. Eventually, the Goa'uld found the planet and determined that the human body is the ultimate host body for their parasitic race. Many humans were kidnapped through the Stargate the Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] brought to Earth (Earth already had its own Stargate in Antarctica but it was inoperable) but the leftover population wasn't touched; they eventually rebelled and drove the Goa'uld off the planet in 3000 BC. About 8000 BC, the Lantean remnants returned to the planet but the primitive civilization extinguished their last hope of rebuilding their once great civilization due to the presence of the Goa'uld; as such, the Ancients slowly died out or [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascended]] since their numbers were too small to survive, even by crossbreeding with regular humans.

With Earth largely left alone for millennia, its human population continued to advance until the rediscovery of the Stargate in 1928 and its subsequent reactivation in 1994 (since its DHD activation device was missing, they had been unable to determine its purpose until they were able to create a computer interface). Unlike an enormous majority of planets, the Stargate on Earth was kept secret from the general populace to prevent widespread panic because "we are not alone".

Humans who are from Earth are referred to as the [[Tau'ri]] by most other life forms in the galaxy, including the [[Goa'uld]]. Earth is a relatively important player on account of the radical change it unwittingly brought about when troops under the command of Colonel [[Jack O'Neill]] killed Goa'uld Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and started a guerrilla war against the Goa'uld. However, its importance pales in comparison to the power of the [[System Lords]] or the [[Free Jaffa Nation]], even though after the extinction of the Asgard and the defeat of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], the Tau'ri became the dominant race of known space — although they were initially at a huge technological disadvantage, they later managed to reverse-engineer Goa'uld technology to the point where they started building their own ships, though much of it was rendered obsolete when the Asgard granted a significant amount of non-weapon technology. The Tau'ri also created remarkable technological feats, such as fighters equipped with hyperdrives powered by an unstable isotope. Their power increased further when they discovered that, due to crossbreeding with Ancients before their extinction, some Earth-born humans actually possessed a unique gene required to operate some of the more advanced Ancient technology. The peak of their power occurred when the Asgard donated their entire technological knowledge to Earth prior to their extinction. With this and some Ancient technology, the Tau'ri actually surpassed their precursors and defeated the Ori.

The main interaction between Earth and the rest of the universe is via three organizations:

*  The '''[[International Oversight Advisory]]''' (IOA) coordinates funds and control between the nations of the Earth [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]; the [[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis Expedition]] was sent to the Pegasus Galaxy under its authority. The key players are the Big Five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the People's Republic of China, and the [[Russia]]n Federation; also important are [[Canada]], on account of its [[Canada – United States relations|special relationship with the United States]] and the services of Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], and other nations, such as Japan, Australia, and Germany, which have also been involved; Germany in particular has sent security personnel to [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]].
* '''[[Stargate Command]]''', under the control of the IOA and operated by the [[United States Air Force]], conducts off-world missions of diplomacy, tactical strikes, research and exploration. Control of the Stargate is a constant bone of contention with the Chinese, who take every opportunity to express their displeasure at the situation at IOA meetings where the future of Stargate Command is an issue (even though their off-world allies are satisfied with the current situation). Nevertheless, the SGC remains the primary interface between the humans of Earth and the outside world, including the galactic human diaspora.
* '''The Atlantis Expedition''' is based in the still sea- and space-worthy [[Atlantis (Stargate)|city-ship]] of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]].  An international team, with [[Tau'ri characters in Stargate Atlantis|personnel from at least 23 countries]], interacts with the other humans of the Pegasus Galaxy (seeded by the Ancients, not taken by the [[Goa'uld]]) and the dangerous [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]].  They rely on a mixture of Ancient and Earth technology and were originally based on Lantea until they were forced to relocate to M35-117. The expedition is currently suspended as Atlantis remains on Earth until repairs are completed after its most recent clash with the Wraith.

===''Star Trek''===
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the unified human state based on Earth, was one of the founding members of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Several major [[federation|federal]] organizations are headquartered on Earth, such as the Federation Council which meets in Paris. The Federation President also keeps offices in Paris, and [[Starfleet]] Headquarters is located in San Francisco. Major events on Earth included first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] (''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''), barely averted attacks by the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] (in "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" and ''Star Trek: First Contact''), Founder infiltration ("[[Homefront (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Homefront]]"), and [[List of fictional revolutions and coups#Star Trek|numerous attempted coups]]. Like most other major Federation worlds, Earth is a near-utopia where poverty and war have been eradicated and environmental damage has been reversed. Earth was also the planet of origin for at least one other sentient species, the Voth, according to the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Distant Origin]]". Descendants of the [[hadrosaurid]]æ, they are theorized to have fled Earth for the [[Delta Quadrant]] after an [[extinction event]].

In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]", we learn that the name of the planet's actual government is named United Earth. Much of its early history is unknown, although recent Trek novels have revealed that Earth's governments founded United Earth by signing the historic ''Traite d'Unification'' in 2123.  The episodes "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]" imply that United Earth is a [[parliamentary system]] of government: we meet various government officials who are referred to as Ministers (such as Minister Nathan Samuels, played by [[Harry Groener]]). United Earth's leader is most likely a Prime Minister – possibly, but not necessarily, Samuels himself. In the novels, Earth's governmental structure is further developed. Earth is a [[parliamentary republic]], with a separate [[head of state]] (the President) and [[head of government]] (the Prime Minister).

In the [[Mirror Universe]], Earth is the capital of the despotic Terran Empire which rules over large portions of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants and is generally seen as the most powerful interstellar empire. ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' revealed that the Empire had collapsed and fallen to a [[Klingon]]–[[Cardassian]] Alliance. ''Star Trek'' novels reveal that Earth was later liberated thanks to the efforts of anti-Alliance rebels and Memory Omega.

===''Starcraft''===
Earth is the "lost" homeland of the terrans of the Koprulu Sector, often referred to as "Old Earth". Earth history is well known to us until the 21st century.
However, by the time the 23rd century was reached, genetic engineering and cybernetics were in common use, and Earth's population had reached 23 billion. Consequently, a resource and overpopulation crisis was developing.

Earth's corporate factions who supported the capitalization of genetic engineering and cybernetics were opposed by those who saw this as a degeneration of the human race. These groups included humanist factions as well as religious conservatives who resorted to terrorism in these turbulent times. The conflict was resolved by the creation of the United Powers League, which generally supported the humanist philosophy and controlled all nations except for a few volatile Latin American states. The UPL banned many religions and made English the worldwide language.

The UPL proceeded to arrest and kill many people who opposed its "divinity of mankind" philosophy (which included "purity" from cybernetics, mutations, and so forth). It was during this time that Doran Routhe set up the colonization of the Koprulu Sector. Contact between the colonists and Earth was seemingly lost, and the Koprulu Sector terrans could not have found their way back to Earth.

With the discovery of the protoss and zerg, the United Powers League reformed to become the United Earth Directorate and launched an invasion of the Koprulu Sector, ostensibly in an effort to protect itself from the distant aliens. The invasion was repelled by a tenuous alliance of the Sector's powers.

===''Babylon 5''===
{{Main article|Earth (Babylon 5)|l1=Earth (''Babylon 5'')}}
In the universe of the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television series, Earth was located in a relatively uncontested and non-valuable portion of the Galaxy. As a result, the people of Earth were allowed to develop with relatively little outside interference or threat of invasion from alien races. Unified under the worldwide government of the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], first contact with the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] was made in the mid-22nd century, which led to trade with a number of different species.

Earth remained a relatively minor power until the 2230s, when it intervened on behalf of a number of other races (which later became the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]]) during the Dilgar invasion. Following the [[Dilgar War]], Earth began to expand its influence and was seen as a rising power in the galaxy. A disastrous [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with the [[Minbari]] in the 2240s precipitated the [[Earth–Minbari War]], in which Earth was nearly conquered: the military ([[EarthForce]]) was devastated and the planet's population was nearly annihilated. However, the Minbari mysteriously surrendered just prior to the final invasion of Earth.

Following the war, Earth's major contribution on the galactic stage was the creation of the Babylon Stations, that are neutral trading posts and diplomatic havens. Earth turned inward and suffered from xenophobic tendencies in the late 2250s, early 2260s under the despotic regime of President [[Morgan Clark]], until a military and civilian [[civil war]], started by General William Hague and later concluded by Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]], overthrew the Clark regime and helped establish Earth as one of the major players in the [[Interstellar Alliance]].

===''Robotech / Macross''===
In the ''[[Robotech]]'' canon, based on ''[[Macross]]'', Earth is the homeworld of humanity and notable as one of the few places that "The flower of life" (the source of the powerful energy source Protoculture) can grow. In 1999 during a global war the (future) SDF-1 an alien warship crashed to Earth on Macross island. Discovering they were not alone in the universe (and in secret the fact that the SDF-1 was a warship for a giant sized alien race) the human race united and rebuilt the ship as well as using the technology to advance their own and to create a small defence fleet for earth.

Ten years later the ship was ready but as preparation for launch on a mission of exploration continued Zentradi warships arrived in orbit to search for the ship. Though humanity tried peaceful contact a booby trap in the SDF-1 fired the huge main gun at the Zentradi committing Earth to a devastating interstellar war. To lure the Zentradi away from Earth the SDF-1 attempted a space fold [[Faster-than-light|FTL jump]]. This went wrong transporting not only the SDF-1 but part of Macross Island, 70,000 civilians and two navy warships to an area near Pluto. Pressure held in sub-surface shelters long enough to evacuate the civilians while the ships were grafted on to the SDF-1 as flight decks. However the jump also caused the FTL drive to vanish (for unknown reasons) as such the SDF-1 had to return home under normal thrust fighting Zentradi all the way and unable to talk to earth due to jamming.

During the conflict many Zentradi became fascinated by Earth culture and over a million ships eventually defected. The ship finally returned to Earth but was driven back into space to draw off the Zentradi again. However the Zentradi bought over four million ships to Earth and bombarded the planet. The SDF-1 took out most ships with an overload of its shield system but in the process the ship was left incapable of flight and most of the Earth's population was killed. Over the next two years the survivors tried to rebuild and at last the Earth began to green again.

Twenty years later the Earth had recovered during the war with the Robotech masters, but even after Earth's victory the planet was then attacked and occupied by another set of aliens The Invid in 2031. The Invid collected what they could of the Protoculture on Earth but seem to have left the population (now millions once more) largely alone.

In 2042 the Robotech Mars expedition returned from deep space but was wiped out by the Invid during the battle to liberate the planet. The survivors were forced down to Earth where they hooked up with the local resistance groups.

Two years later a massive fleet arrived with more advanced technology given to them by the alien Hydenites. The Invid quickly left Earth rather than risk Earth's destruction by deadly weapons the Neutron_S missiles which were far more dangerous than man believed. As Humanity celebrated however the Hydenites were revealed as the Children of Shadow who had destroyed the Invid homeworld eons before. They launched a sneak attack on the human space station liberty. Another war then began.

===''Sonic the Hedgehog''===
In the various continuities of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise, Earth is mentioned in one way or another:

*The video game series has [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] living on Earth, specifically a United States-like [[fictional country]] known as the United Federation. It is stated in ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'' that the planet has been in an endless cycle of destruction and resurrection since time immemorial: a monster known as Dark Gaia hibernates within the Earth's core, absorbing power from the negative energies and emotions of humanity, and destroys the planet when it emerges, and its counterpart, Light Gaia (a.k.a. "Chip"), defeats it and restores the Earth. In the game's plot, [[Doctor Eggman]], hoping to use Dark Gaia's power to build his empire, breaks the planet open himself and awakens both Light and Dark Gaia ahead of schedule; as a result, Dark Gaia's body splits apart, and Light Gaia develops severe [[amnesia]].
*The [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic book]] by [[Archie Comics]] reveals that the planet of [[Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Mobius]] is actually the Earth of a distant future; an alien race known as the Xorda launched several bombs meant to exterminate humanity, but instead ended up mutating the various wildlife, giving them [[humanoid]] forms, human [[cognition]], and (in many cases) [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]].
*[[Fleetway]]'s ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'' shows Earth existing as a separate planet from Mobius; the two planets are effectively "[[Double planet|twins]]", both having near-identical [[ecosystem]]s.
*In the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], the planet Freedom (specifically the Land of Darkness) is heavily implied to be a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth. Early on in the film, Sonic and [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] are seen traveling through what appears to be the ruins of New York City.
*In the [[anime]] series ''[[Sonic X]]'', Sonic, his friends, and Eggman hail from an alternate version of Earth; Mobius and Earth were once one planet, but a cataclysmic event split the planet into two and sent what would become Mobius into another dimension. The flow of time is different on both planets; one month in Mobuis equals an entire year on Earth.

===''Super Mario''===
* According to various sources, including ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', the Mushroom Kingdom and its surrounding areas and locations are part of the "Mushroom World," a parallel version of the Earth, or "Real World." One can travel back and forth between the two dimensions through warp pipes.
* In the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|1993 live-action film]], it is stated that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] actually split Earth into two and sent them into different dimensions. The surviving [[dinosaur]]s were sent to the alternate dimension, and that world's version of the [[human]] race eventually evolved from those dinosaurs rather than [[mammal]]s. Aside from Dinohattan, a run-down parallel version of [[New York City]], the entirety of the alternate Earth is a desert wasteland.

===''Uplift''===
At least a billion years ago in the [[Uplift Universe]] by [[David Brin]], there was a semi-mythical species known as the Progenitors that started the Uplift cycle—adopting a pre-sentient race and over a period of a hundred thousand years of selective breeding and genetic engineering, raising them to full sentience.  As a result, most sentient species in the universe are members of various clans and factions, often quite powerful, with varying beliefs.

Earth was overlooked and humans evolved, evidently without a patron race.  However, by the time of first contact with galactic civilization, humans had themselves raised chimpanzees and dolphins to sentience, giving the human race a claim to patron status.  This claim is provisionally accepted by the major institutions of galactic civilization even as it is hotly contested by a number of senior patron races.

Galactic civilization holds humanity's claim of having evolved to sentience independently to be highly controversial at best, and an offensive heresy at worst. Some clans holding the latter view have actively conspired to have humanity's patron status officially vacated and to adopt the "wolfling" race themselves, thus gaining three sentient races and control of "fallow" genetic material: Earth's wealth of species with uplift potential.  Only the conservative and ponderous nature of galactic institutions and the rivalry of other clans reluctant to see the Earth's races claimed by another have prevented this.

===''Worldwar''===
In the [[Worldwar]] novels by [[Harry Turtledove]], Earth is the human homeworld and is attacked by the aliens known as The Race in 1942. All sides in the Second World War are forced to unify to fight this threat, and despite superior technology the Lizards (a human racial epithet for the aliens) are fought to a draw by 1944.

In 1962 another Race fleet arrives carrying a civilian colony force of nearly 100 million, in 1965 the Race and the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] fight a major war which Germany loses.

In 1994 humanity has caught up to the Race enough to send a slower-than-light starship to the Race's home world, where it arrives in 2031. Soon after another ship arrives, an [[Faster-than-light|FTL-capable]] ship, indicating that humanity has now surpassed the Race in technology.

===''MOTHER / EarthBound''===
* In the ''[[EarthBound|MOTHER / EarthBound]]'' video game series, Earth has different continent names and different cities but is still the same. Between 2000 and 2010, an alien known as Giygas took over the planet and destroyed most of the population. But, with the warning from a small alien from the future, a young hero named [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]] saved the world from Giygas before he could attack.
* Many thousands of years later, all the population of Earth was killed – presumably because the planet was flooded – but some people went on the [[Mother 3|Nowhere Island]] before everything was destroyed. The island was protected because it contained a great power that was sealed long ago. The survivors hid their memories in an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and created new ones, better ones so that they could have a normal life without remembering the world of before. Later in the game, Earth was again destroyed but then recreated as it was before. It is unknown if it means before the planet was flooded or before the game's tragic events.

===''Shannara''===
In the [[Shannara]] series of books by [[Terry Brooks]], the setting is a post-apocalyptic earth that was destroyed after a nuclear holocaust wiped out most of humanity and mutated the survivors into Men, Gnomes, Dwarves, and Trolls. Elves are also there, but according to Allanon's recounting of history, the Elves always existed in our current world. Before the Great Wars, as the nuclear holocaust is referred to, humans had advanced to a utopian society.

===''The Death Gate Cycle''===
In the [[Death gate cycle]] series of books by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]], a nuclear holocaust led to the creation of a two mutant strains of humans who developed fantastic magical powers. Other races, such as Dwarves and Elves were also present, even in pre-holocaust Earth, but were hidden from humanity.  In this universe, the Earth was destroyed by the Sartan, one of the magical races that evolved from humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">'''Endogenosymbiosis''' is an [[evolution]]ary process, proposed by the evolutionary and environmental biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, in which "gene carriers" ([[virus]]es, [[retrovirus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s) and symbiotic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]) could share parts or all of their [[genome]]s in an endogenous symbiotic relationship with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-endogenosymbiosis-hypothesis.html|title=Two new studies confirm the 'endogenosymbiosis' hypothesis |date=October 2016 |work=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Gatti |first=Roberto Cazzolla |date=2015 |title=A new idea on the evolution of biodiversity |biorxiv=019828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cazzolla Gatti |first=Roberto|date=2016-03-01|title=A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2016.71.issue-3/biolog-2016-0032/biolog-2016-0032.xml?format=INT |journal=Biologia |volume=71 |issue=3 |doi=10.1515/biolog-2016-0032 |issn=1336-9563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

The related process of [[symbiogenesis]] or endosymbiosis was proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. She proposed that this had created the [[eukaryote]]s, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical [[Darwinian]] cycle of [[mutation]], [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic symbiosis from parasites ==
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at [[Tomsk State University]] (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that "the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the [[parasitism]], also represents the origin of biodiversity". 
In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged "parasitic" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. 
"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".

This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the [[punctuated equilibrium theory]] proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].

== Evidence ==
Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between [[mammal]]ian hosts and their many viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Henzy, J. E., &amp; Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224&lt;/ref&gt;

David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive [[amino acid]] changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.&lt;ref&gt;Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., &amp; Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous [[retrovirus]]es. This may be an underestimate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in [[bacteriophage]]s. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Bordenstein &amp; Seth R. Bordenstein, Eukaryotic association module in phage WO genomes from Wolbachia, Nature Communications 7, Article number: 13155 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms13155&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]]. Major reference = &lt;ref name="engineeringtoolbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fossil-fuels-energy-content-d_1298.html |title=Fossil and Alternative Fuels - Energy Content (2008).  |publisher=Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''evolutionary computation''' is a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[global optimization]] inspired by [[biological evolution]], and the subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]] studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based [[trial and error]] problem solvers with a [[metaheuristic]] or [[stochastic optimization]] character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a [[population]] of solutions is subjected to [[natural selection]] (or [[artificial selection]]) and [[mutation]]. As a result, the population will gradually [[evolution|evolve]] to increase in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in this case the chosen [[fitness function]] of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in [[computer science]]. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in [[evolutionary biology]] as an ''in silico'' experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places.

''[[Evolutionary programming]]'' was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US, while [[John Henry Holland]] called his method a ''[[genetic algorithm]]''. In Germany [[Ingo Rechenberg]] and [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] introduced ''[[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]''. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives ("dialects") of one technology, called ''evolutionary computing''. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged – ''[[genetic programming]]''. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation.

These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub-areas.

Simulations of [[evolution]] using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;G.

*[[Swarm intelligence]]

== Evolutionary algorithms ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]] such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. [[Candidate solutions]] to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[Loss function|cost function]] determines the environment within which the solutions "live" (see also [[fitness function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems:  '''Recombination''' and '''mutation''' create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while '''selection''' acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are [[stochastic]]. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher [[Fitness function|fitness]] have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower [[Fitness function|fitness]], but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}

[[Genetic algorithms]] deliver methods to model [[biological systems]] and [[systems biology]] that are linked to the theory of [[dynamical systems]], since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of [[computational theory]], beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. 

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/#InfEvo &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= J.G. Diaz Ochoa |title= Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2018 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7 |ref=harv|bibcode=2018JMolE..86...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, following concepts from [[computational theory]], micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable ([[completeness (logic)]]), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. Danchin |title= Bacteria as computers making computers |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol. Rev.]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2008 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00137.x |ref=harv|bibcode= |pmc=2704931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between [[inheritance systems]] and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by [[Erez Lieberman]], Christoph Hauert and [[Martin Nowak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = E. | last2 = Hauert | first2 = C. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = M. A. | doi = 10.1038/nature03204 | title = Evolutionary dynamics on graphs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7023 | pages = 312–316 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15662424 | pmc = | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..312L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]], or as a stochastic process.  We may consider the mutant population on a graph as a random walk between absorbing barriers representing mutant extinction and mutant fixation.  For highly symmetric graphs, we can then use martingales to find the ''fixation probability'' as illustrated by Monk (2018).

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

'''''Freddy Fox''''' ({{ISBN|0-9754701-0-8}}) is a [[hardcover]] [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Ronald J. Meyer]]. It tells the story of a young fox and his family, following the daily activities of the fox kit, Freddy.  Freddy Fox teaches the reader about [[red fox]]es, including that they are born shades of gray, how their den is built, what they eat, and family size. Then through a simple segue, Freddy's red fox mother teaches the young fox about other animals and traits attributed to them.  By learning his lessons, Freddy will grow up to be a wise fox.  All of the lessons, such as the [[bear]] eats a balanced diet or the [[raccoon]] washes his hands before eating, can easily be translated into lessons for young children.

The book was first published in 2004. It won the Silver [[Mom's Choice Award]] in the "Animal Kingdom" category in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php Mom's Choice Awards 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225071706/http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is a [[wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]], and he used his wildlife photographs to illustrate the book.

'''Geothermal energy''' is [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of materials (in currently uncertain&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dye, S. T. |title=Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=50|issue=3|pages=RG3007|doi=10.1029/2012RG000400|year=2012|arxiv = 1111.6099 |bibcode = 2012RvGeo..50.3007D }}&lt;/ref&gt; but possibly roughly equal&lt;ref name=Gando&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gando, A. |author2=Dwyer, D.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous [[Thermal conduction|conduction of thermal energy]] in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''γη (ge)'', meaning earth, and ''θερμος (thermos)'', meaning hot.

[[Earth's internal heat budget|Earth's internal heat]] is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation.&lt;ref name=turcotte/&gt; Temperatures at the [[core–mantle boundary]] may reach over 4000&amp;nbsp;°C (7,200&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1038/ngeo.2007.44|title=Core–mantle boundary heat flow|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|pages=25–32|year=2008|last1=Lay|first1=Thorne|last2=Hernlund|first2=John|last3=Buffett|first3=Bruce A.|bibcode=2008NatGe...1...25L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] to behave plastically, resulting in portions of the [[mantle convection|mantle convecting]] upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370&amp;nbsp;°C (700&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With water from [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]]. Worldwide, 11,700 [[megawatts]] (MW) of geothermal power was available in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |title=Geothermal capacity &amp;#124; About BP &amp;#124; BP Global |publisher=Bp.com |accessdate=2014-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129051911/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 28 gigawatts of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.&lt;ref name="IPCC"/&gt;

Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,&lt;ref&gt;Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781420075700}}.{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, plate boundary movement and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweb.org/greenpower Green Power]. eweb.org&lt;/ref&gt; show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal. But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cothran|first=Helen|title=Energy Alternatives|year=2002|publisher=Greenhaven Press|isbn=978-0737709049}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, geothermal energy costs between two and ten US cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(01)00002-8|title=Geothermal energy for the benefit of the people|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=5|issue=3|pages=299–312|year=2001|last1=Fridleifsson|first1=Ingvar B|citeseerx=10.1.1.459.1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century AD, Romans conquered ''[[Aquae Sulis]]'', now [[Bath, Somerset]], England, and used the hot springs there to feed [[thermae|public baths]] and [[hypocaust|underfloor heating]]. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power.

In 1892, America's first [[district heating]] system in [[Boise, Idaho]] was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] in 1900. The first known building in the world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the [[Hot Lake Hotel]] in [[Union County, Oregon]], whose construction was completed in 1907.{{sfn|Cleveland|Morris|2015|p=291}} A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and [[Tuscany]] at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{Citation

In the 20th century, demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince [[Piero Ginori Conti]] tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Geothermal electric plants were traditionally built exclusively on the edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range.&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; Demonstration projects are operational in [[Landau-Pfalz]], Germany, and [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]], France, while an earlier effort in [[Basel]], Switzerland was shut down [[Induced seismicity in Basel|after it triggered earthquakes]].

The [[thermal efficiency]] of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of [[thermodynamics]] limits the efficiency of [[Cycle efficiency|heat engines]] in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its [[capacity factor]] can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The global average was 73% in 2005.

==Types==
Geothermal energy comes in either ''vapor-dominated'' or ''liquid-dominated'' forms. [[Larderello]] and [[The Geysers]] are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C that produce superheated steam.

===Liquid-dominated plants===
Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) were more common with temperatures greater than {{convert|200|C}} and are found near young volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. ''Flash plants'' are the common way to generate electricity from these sources. Pumps are generally not required, powered instead when the water turns to steam. Most wells generate 2-10 MWe. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators, while the liquid is returned to the reservoir for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system is [[Cerro Prieto]] in Mexico, which generates 750 MWe from temperatures reaching {{convert|350|C|F}}. The [[Salton Sea]] field in Southern California offers the potential of generating 2000 MWe.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

Lower temperature LDRs (120–200&amp;nbsp;°C) require pumping. They are common in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, such as in the Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a [[heat exchanger]] in a [[Rankine cycle]] binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a [[turbine]]. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=eere&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/low_temperature_resources.html Low-Temperature and Co-produced Geothermal Resources]. U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal energy===
{{Main article|Geothermal heating|geothermal heat pump}}
Lower temperature sources produce the energy equivalent of 100M BBL per year. Sources with temperatures of 30–150&amp;nbsp;°C are used without conversion to electricity as [[district heating]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[fisheries]], mineral recovery, industrial process heating and bathing in 75 countries. Heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10–20&amp;nbsp;°C in 43 countries for use in space heating and cooling. Home heating is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with global annual growth rate of 30% in 2005&lt;ref&gt;

Approximately 270&amp;nbsp;petajoules&amp;nbsp;(PJ) of geothermal heating was used in 2004. More than half went for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28&amp;nbsp;GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter. Some 88&amp;nbsp;PJ for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3&amp;nbsp;million [[geothermal heat pump]]s with a total capacity of 15 GW.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;

Heat for these purposes may also be extracted from co-generation at a [[geothermal electrical plant]].

Heating is cost-effective at many more sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or [[geysers]], water can be piped directly into [[radiators]]. In hot, dry ground, [[earth tubes]] or [[downhole heat exchanger]]s can collect the heat. However, even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces.&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including [[air conditioning]], [[seasonal thermal energy storage]], [[solar energy]] collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.

Iceland is the world leader in direct applications. Some 92.5% of its homes are heated with geothermal energy, saving Iceland over $100 million annually in avoided oil imports. [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] has the world's biggest district heating system, often used to heat pathways and roads to hinder the accumulation of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reykjavik: The ground heats the city - Danish Architecture Centre|url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/reykjavik-the-ground-heats-the-city/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825132818/http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/reykjavik-the-ground-heats-the-city/|archivedate=2016-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once known as the most polluted city in the world, it is now one of the cleanest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pahl|first=Greg|title=The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook: Community Solutions to a Global Crisis|year=2007|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced geothermal===
{{Main article|Enhanced geothermal system}}
Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ [[directional drilling]] to expand the size of the reservoir.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

Small-scale EGS have been installed in the [[Rhine Graben]] at [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]] in France and at [[Landau]] and [[Insheim]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

==Economics==
Geothermal power requires no fuel (except for pumps), and is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in [[Nevada]] can support 4.5 [[megawatt]]s (MW) and costs about $10&amp;nbsp;million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.&lt;ref name="econ101"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 per&amp;nbsp;kilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in [[Bavaria]] was estimated at somewhat over 1&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;€ per&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the number of greenhouses heated by geothermal energy is increasing fast.

Geothermal projects have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At the early stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These power rates are more than double humanity’s current energy consumption from all primary sources, but most of this energy flow is not recoverable. In addition to the internal heat flows, the top layer of the surface to a depth of {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} is heated by solar energy during the summer, and releases that energy and cools during the winter.

Outside of the seasonal variations, the [[geothermal gradient]] of temperatures through the crust is 25–30&amp;nbsp;°C (77–86&amp;nbsp;°F) per kilometer of depth in most of the world. The conductive heat [[flux]] averages 0.1&amp;nbsp;MW/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]] or a combination of these.

A geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources.&lt;ref name="utilization" /&gt; The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a [[hot spring]]. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot [[aquifer]]. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to [[hydraulically fracture]] the bedrock. This last approach is called [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] in Europe, or [[enhanced geothermal systems]] in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{Citation

==Production==
According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) installed geothermal capacity in the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce the last annual survey in March 2012. This increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012. GEA also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 MW, bringing current installed U.S. geothermal capacity to 3,386 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://geo-energy.org/pressReleases/2013/GEA2013UpdateRelease.aspx |title=GEA Update Release 2013 |publisher=Geo-energy.org |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewability and sustainability==
Geothermal power is considered to be [[Renewable energy|renewable]] because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of [[1 E31 J|10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;joules]] (3·10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; About 20% of this is residual heat from [[planetary accretion]], and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past.&lt;ref name="turcotte"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.{{clarify|reason=When would tapping heat not accelerate the cooling? Minutely, yes, but still.|date=May 2015}}

Geothermal power is also considered to be [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] thanks to its power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations to use their own resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Is Geothermal Energy Renewable and Sustainable|url=http://www.energyauditorhq.com/is-geothermal-energy-renewable-and-sustainable/|work=Energy Auditor: Your Headquarters For Smart Sustainable Living:|accessdate=9 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608044704/http://www.energyauditorhq.com/is-geothermal-energy-renewable-and-sustainable/|archive-date=2013-06-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.

Even though geothermal power is globally sustainable, extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.&lt;ref name="sustainability" /&gt; Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at [[Larderello]], [[Wairakei]], and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in [[Italy]] since 1913, at the Wairakei field in [[New Zealand]] since 1958,&lt;ref name="Wairakei"&gt;

Falling electricity production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at [[Poihipi Power Station|Poihipi]] and [[Ohaaki Power Station|Ohaaki]]. The [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei]] power station has been running much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around the start of the 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.

Fluids drawn from the deep earth carry a mixture of gases, notably [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2|}}), [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S|}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4|}}) and [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3|}}). These pollutants contribute to [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and noxious smells if released. Existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of {{convert|122|kg|lb}} of {{chem|CO|2|}} per megawatt-hour (MW·h) of electricity, a small fraction of the [[emission intensity]] of conventional fossil fuel plants.&lt;ref name="CO2"&gt;

Direct geothermal heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This [[parasitic load]] is normally a fraction of the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a [[combined cycle]] [[natural gas]] plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas [[condensing furnace]] of the same size.&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;

==Legal frameworks==
Some of the legal issues raised by geothermal energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, and the extent to which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.

It is there he met his first wife (a native German), in 1956. After his discharge from the military, he moved back to the US after a brief time living in Germany, and worked in factories for twenty years while writing poetry.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He received his B.A. in English (1972) and M.A. in English literature (1974) from the [[University of Colorado]],&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"/&gt; where he had studied on the [[G.I. Bill of Rights|G.I.

Subsequently, [[Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative]] published three books of Collom's essays and commentary on this experience (which included the young students' poems), notably ''Poetry Everywhere'' and ''Moving Windows''.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

From 1966 to 1977, he published the work of many writers in a [[Literary magazine|little magazine]] called "The".&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; He was twice awarded Poetry Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]],&lt;ref name="jacketmagazine.com"/&gt; and received a [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award (2012).&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org" /&gt; From 1986 until his death in 2017, Collom taught at [[Naropa University]]'s [[Jack Kerouac School]] of Disembodied Poetics as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]],&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa" /&gt; where he shaped Writing Outreach, a community creative-writing project, into a course.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackkerouacschool.org/2013/02/13/folio-jks-faculty-reading-to-celebrate-recent-publications/|title=FOLIO: JKS Faculty Reading to Celebrate Recent Publications|first=|last=administrator|date=February 13, 2013|publisher=Jack Kerouac School /Folio: Events Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.naropa.edu/2011-fall/features/from-nature-to-nurture.php|title=From Nature to Nurture|website=magazine.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he pioneered Eco-Lit,&lt;ref name="corpse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpse.org/archives/issue_9/critiques/collom.htm|title=Exquisite Corpse – A Journal of Letters and Life|website=www.corpse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first ecology literature courses ever offered in the United States.&lt;ref name="dailycamera.com" /&gt; Some of his accomplishments as an environmentalist-poet are documented in ''American Environmental Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/book/ghael|title=American environmental leaders from colonial times to the present|first1=Anne|last1=Becher|first2=Joseph|last2=Richey|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Grey House Pub.|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nature writings and essays about the environment were published in various venues, including ''ecopoetics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecopoetics.wordpress.com|title=ecopoetics|website=ecopoetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Alphabet of Trees: A Guide to Writing Nature Poetry'',&lt;ref name="corpse.org"/&gt; and ''ISLE'', the journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/isle/article-abstract/7/2/243/731906/In-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ (2000) Volume 7 (Issue 2): 243].

He read and taught throughout the United States, in Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], Austria, Belgium, and Germany. In 2008, he was the plenary speaker at the "Poetic Ecologies" conference at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]].&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"/&gt; In 2009, he led a three-week Creativity and Aging Program at Woodland Pattern in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He worked with numerous dancers, visual artists and musician/composers, and recorded three CDs: ''Calluses of Poetry''&lt;ref&gt;''Calluses of Poetry'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1996 {{ISBN|9780965187800}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Colors Born of Shadow'',&lt;ref&gt;''Colors Born of Shadow'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1999 ASIN B000F7G0IY&lt;/ref&gt; with Ken Bernstein,&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; and ''Blue Yodel Blue Heron'', with Dan Hankin and Sierra Collom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blue Yodel Blue Heron|publisher=Baksun Books|year=2002|isbn=9781887997539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote =I felt, and events have born out, that eco-lit was really an upcoming topic for the world. I was motivated by the cause of ecology—saving nature and ourselves from our own foolish extinction through pollution and overuse of resources—and the fact that it's an art with admirable philosophical achievements. But also for the fun of it. Humor is an important part of the class, and we can go from discussing the most tragic thing to cracking jokes. I'm for that kind of juxtaposition, which sometimes goes against expectations because people want to look upon nature very solemnly due to its beauty or endangered status. But I think humor is as deep as anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">'''Liberal naturalism''' is a heterodox form of [[metaphysical naturalism]] that lies in the conceptual space between [[scientific naturalism|scientific (or reductive) naturalism]] and [[supernaturalism]]. It allows that one can respect the explanations and results of the successful sciences without supposing that [[science|the sciences]] are our only resource for understanding humanity and our dealings with the world and each other.

The term was introduced in 2004 by [[Mario De Caro]] &amp; [[David Macarthur]]&lt;ref&gt;De Caro, M. &amp; Macarthur, D. ''Naturalism in Question'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, April 2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and, independently, by [[Gregg Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Gregg, ''A Place for Consciousness: Probing the Deep Structure of the Natural World'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, November 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of naturalism has been ascribed to [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For a liberal naturalist many things in our everyday world that are not explicable (or not fully explicable) by science are, nonetheless, presupposed by science—e.g. tables, persons, artworks, institutions, rational norms and values. Explaining such things might require non-scientific non-supernatural resources according to this form of naturalism. So, rather than tailoring their [[ontology]] to the posits of the successful sciences, as scientific naturalists do, liberal naturalists recognise the prima facie irreducible reality of everyday objects that are part of what [[Wilfrid Sellars]] called "the manifest image".&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, W. ''Science, Perception &amp; Reality'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal naturalism is a "liberal"&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind, Value and Reason'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1998), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. ''Skepticism and Naturalism: Some Varieties'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; naturalism for several reasons each of which contrasts with scientific naturalist orthodoxy:
# As we have seen, it does not limit its ontological commitments to the explanatory posits of the successful sciences. 
# It acknowledges the existence of non-scientific modes of knowing and/or understanding such things as the value of artworks, the moral dimension of persons, and the relations between reasons of different kinds;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. "Pragmatism and Nonscientific Knowledge" in ''Hilary Putnam: Pragmatism and Realism'', ed. Urszula M. Zeglen and James Conant (London and New York: Routledge, 2002), 14-24&lt;/ref&gt; 
# It allows for distinctively 1st-personal aspects of [[rational agent|rational agency]] such as [[decision making|making up one's mind]], taking [[personal responsibility|responsibility for one's actions]], and [[self-consciousness]];&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind and World'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It attempts to provide a non-reductive non-supernatural account of the rational or conceptual normativity to which we are responsive in theoretical and practical reasoning, e.g., by appeal to the Hegelian or pragmatist idea of mutual acknowledgement in a community;&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur, D. "Pragmatism, Metaphysical Quietism and the Problem of Normativity" in ''Philosophical Topics'', vol 36 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It challenges the widely influential Quinean thesis that philosophy, when properly naturalized, must limit itself to the methods of the successful sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Theories and Things'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 1981), ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volcanoes==
{{Further|List of Cascade volcanoes}}

Volcanoes south of the [[Fraser River]] in the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] (a [[geology|geological]] term) belong to the Cascade Range (a [[geography|geographic]] term). Peaks are listed north to south.

===North Cascades===
[[File:Mount Baker.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Baker]]
*[[Coquihalla Mountain]] (southern British Columbia)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highest peak in the [[Bedded Range]]. It is a major preserved [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Pemberton Volcanic Belt]], an extinct portion of the [[Canadian Cascade Arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monger|first=J.W.H.|chapter=Character of volcanism, volcanic hazards, and risk, northern end of the Cascade magmatic arc, British Columbia and Washington State|page=235|title=Geology and Geological Hazards of the Vancouver Region, Southwestern British Columbia|date=1994|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|location=[[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]|isbn=0-660-15784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mount Baker]] (Near the [[United States]]-[[Canada]] border)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highest peak in northern [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is an [[active volcano]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last = Scott | first = Kevin M. |author2=Wes Hildreth |author3=Cynthia A. Gardner  | title = Mount Baker-Living with an Active Volcano: U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 059-00 | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = 2005-05-25 | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2000/fs059-00/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam activity from its [[Volcanic crater|crater]] occurs relatively frequently. Mount Baker is one of the snowiest places on Earth; in 1999 the ski area (on a subsidiary peak) recorded the world's greatest single-season snowfall: {{convert|1140|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
*[[Glacier Peak]] (northern Washington)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; secluded and relatively inaccessible peak. Contrary to its name, its glacial cover is not that extensive. The volcano is surprisingly small in volume, and gets most of its height by having grown atop a nonvolcanic ridge.

===High Cascades===
[[File:MSH82 st helens plume from harrys ridge 05-19-82.jpg|thumb|right|1982 minor eruption of Mount St. Helens]]
*[[Mount Rainier]] (southeast of [[Tacoma, Washington]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highest peak in the Cascades, it dominates the surrounding landscape. There is no other higher peak northward until the Yukon-Alaska-BC border apex beyond the [[Alsek River]].
*[[Mount St. Helens]] (southern Washington)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Erupted in 1980, leveling forests to the north of the mountain and sending ash across the northwest. The northern part of the mountain was destroyed in the blast ([[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption]]).
*[[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] (east of Mount St. Helens)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the second highest peak in Washington and third highest in the Cascade Range.
*[[Mount Hood]] (northern [[Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the highest peak in Oregon and arguably the most frequently climbed major peak in the Cascades.
*[[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] (northcentral Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the second highest peak in Oregon.
*[[Three Fingered Jack]] (northcentral Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Highly eroded [[Pleistocene]] volcano.
*[[Mount Washington (Oregon)|Mount Washington]] (between Santiam and McKenzie passes)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a highly eroded shield volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://areas.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?areaname=Mount%20Washington%20Wilderness&amp;CU_ID=144|publisher=Wildernet.com|title=Mount Washington Wilderness, Willamette National Forest, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Three Sisters (Oregon)|Three Sisters]] (near the city of [[Bend, Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; South Sister is the highest and youngest, with a well-defined crater. Middle Sister is more pyramidal and eroded. North Sister is the oldest and has a crumbling rock pinnacle.
*[[Broken Top]] (to the southeast of South Sister)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a highly eroded extinct [[stratovolcano]]. Contains [[Bend Glacier|Bend]] and [[Crook Glacier]]s.
*[[Newberry Volcano]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; isolated [[caldera]] with two crater [[lake]]s. Very variable lavas. Flows from here have reached the city of Bend.
*[[Mount Bachelor]] (near Three Sisters)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a geologically young (less than 15,000 years) shield-to-stratovolcano which is now the site of a popular [[skiing|ski]] resort. ([[Mt. Bachelor ski area]])
*[[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] (south of [[Willamette Pass]]) &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a {{convert|8744|ft|m|abbr=on}} volcano composed of {{convert|15|km3|cumi|1|abbr=on}} of [[basaltic andesite]].
*[[Mount Bailey (Oregon)|Mount Bailey]] (north of Mount Mazama)
*[[Mount Thielsen]] (east of Mount Bailey)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highly eroded volcano with a prominent spire, making it the Lightning Rod of the Cascades.
*[[Mount Mazama]] (southern Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; better known for its [[Crater Lake]], which is a [[caldera]] formed by a catastrophic eruption which took out most of the summit roughly 6,900 years ago. Mount Mazama is estimated to have been about {{convert|11000|ft|m|abbr=on}} elevation prior to the blast.
*[[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]] (southern Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; on the southeastern flank of Crater Lake.  At {{convert|8929|ft|m|abbr=on}} elevation, this small stratovolcano is the highest peak in [[Crater Lake National Park]].
*[[Mount McLoughlin]] (near [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; presents a symmetrical appearance when viewed from [[Klamath Lake]].
*[[Medicine Lake Volcano]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a [[shield volcano]] in [[northern California]] which is the largest volcano by volume in the Cascades.
*[[Mount Shasta]] (northern California)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; second highest peak in the Cascades. Can be seen in the [[Sacramento Valley]] as far as {{convert|140|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, as it is a dominating feature of the region.
*[[Lassen Peak]] (south of Mount Shasta)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; southernmost volcano in the Cascades and the most easily climbed peak in the Cascades. It erupted from 1914 to 1921, and like Mount Shasta, it too can be seen in the Sacramento Valley, up to {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. Lowest Peak because the Cascades extend from it.

[[File:Santiam Pass.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Three Fingered Jack]] and [[Santiam Pass]], Oregon]]

There are four [[U.S. National Park]]s in the Cascade Range, one National Scenic Area, and many [[U.S. National Monument]]s, [[U.S. Wilderness Area]]s, and [[U.S. National Forest]]s. Each classification protects the various [[glacier]]s, volcanoes, [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] fields, rivers, lakes, forests, and wildlife to varying degrees.

===National parks===
*[[Lassen Volcanic National Park]] was established in 1916 while its namesake peak was erupting. The park includes the most extensive and active thermal areas in the [[United States]] outside [[Yellowstone National Park]].
*[[Crater Lake National Park]] preserves the remains of [[Mount Mazama]], a large volcano that imploded thousands of years ago, forming a [[caldera]] that was later filled with rain and ground water, later to be known as [[Crater Lake]].
*[[Mount Rainier National Park]] surrounds the Cascades' highest volcano, [[Mount Rainier]], which in turn is covered by the largest [[glacier]] system in the United States south of [[Alaska]].
*[[North Cascades National Park]] was carved out of a primitive part of the range composed of ancient [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[sedimentary rock]]. [[Mount Baker]] and [[Glacier Peak]] are nearby.

===National Scenic Areas===
*[[Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area]]

===National monuments===
*[[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] was formed following the [[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption|1980 eruption]] of [[Mount St. Helens]] in order to preserve the devastated area and give scientists a chance to study its recovery.
*[[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] includes the area around [[Newberry Volcano]] in central [[Oregon]].
*[[Cascade–Siskiyou National Monument]] is located in southern [[Oregon]] at the junction of the Cascades and the [[Siskiyou Mountains]].
*[[Lava Beds National Monument]] in [[California]] lies on the northeast flank of the [[Medicine Lake Volcano]] and is the site of the largest concentration of [[lava tube]] caves in the United States.

===Provincial Parks===
*[[Skagit Valley Provincial Park]]
*[[E.C. Manning Provincial Park]]
*[[Cascade Recreation Area]]
*[[Cathedral Provincial Park and Protected Area]]
*[[Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park]]
*[[Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park]]

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]]. In Christian belief, the [[Last Judgement]] is an apocalyptic event where God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.|alt=A three paneled colour painting. The centre panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael is weighing souls. On the left hand panel, the saved are being guided into heaven, while on the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to hell]]

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]].

| [[WR 104#Effects on Earth|Peter Tuthill]]
| In approximately 300,000 years, [[WR 104]], a [[triple star]], is expected to explode in a [[supernova]]. It has been suggested that it may produce a [[gamma ray burst]] that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of 30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth.

| The [[Sun]]'s increasing brightness causes the rate of [[weathering]] of the planet's [[crust (geology)|crust]] to increase. This will cause the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]] to drop dramatically, making [[photosynthesis]] in [[plants]] impossible. This will very likely cause a mega [[mass extinction]] of the Earth's [[vegetation]]. The lack of [[oxygen]]-producing plants will cause [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to disappear as well as the [[ozone layer]], making [[animal]] life impossible. Even if photosynthesis was still possible, rising surface tempatures from the brighter sun will make complex life (plants and animals) impossible.

A '''[[glacier]]''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|GLAY|shər}}) or ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|i|ə}}) is a persistent body of dense [[ice]] that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of [[snow]] exceeds its [[ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) over many years, often [[centuries]]. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating [[crevasse]]s, [[serac]]s, and other distinguishing features. Because glacial mass is affected by long-term [[climate]] changes, e.g., [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature|mean temperature]], and [[cloud cover]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacial mass change]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of [[climate change]].

===Antarctica===
[[File:Fryxellsee Opt.jpg|right|thumb|[[Canada Glacier]] in Antarctica]]
{{main|List of glaciers in the Antarctic}}

There are many glaciers in the Antarctic. This set of lists does not include [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s or [[ice field]]s, such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but includes [[Glacier|glacial]] features that are defined by their flow, rather than general bodies of ice. The lists include [[Glacier morphology#Outlet glaciers|outlet glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Valley glaciers|valley glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Cirque glaciers|cirque glaciers]], [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|tidewater glaciers]] and [[ice stream]]s. Ice streams are a type of glacier&lt;ref name="NSIDC" /&gt; and many of them have "glacier" in their name, e.g. [[Pine Island Glacier]]. [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] are listed separately in the [[List of Antarctic ice shelves]]. For the purposes of these lists, the [[Antarctic]] is defined as any [[latitude]] further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]).&lt;ref name="nbTreatyText" /&gt;

There are also glaciers in the subantarctic. This includes one [[snow field]] ([[Murray Snowfield]]). Snow fields are not glaciers in the strict sense of the word, but they are commonly found at the [[accumulation zone]] or head of a glacier.&lt;ref name=nsidc&gt;{{cite web

The majority of Europe's glaciers are found in the Alps, Caucasus and the Scandinavian Mountains (mostly Norway) as well as in Iceland. Iceland has the largest glacier in Europe, [[Vatnajökull]] glacier, that covers between 8,100-8,300&amp;nbsp;km² in area and 3,100&amp;nbsp;km³ in volume. Norway alone has more than 2500 glaciers (including very small ones) covering an estimated 1% of mainland Norway's surface area. Several of mainland Europe's biggest glaciers are found here including; [[Jostedal Glacier|Jostedalsbreen]](the largest in mainland Europe at 487&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Svartisen|Vestre Svartisen]](221&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Søndre Folgefonna]](168&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Svartisen|Østre Svartisen]](148&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

{{maincat|Glaciers of North America}}
There are a number of glaciers existing in North America, currently or in recent centuries. In the United States, these [[glacier]]s are located in nine states, all in the Rocky Mountains or further west. The southernmost named glacier among them is the [[Lilliput Glacier]] in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], east of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California.

[[Mexico]] has about two dozen glaciers, all of which are located on [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlaltépetl), [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]], the three tallest mountains in the country.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Sidney E.|title=Glaciers of Mexico|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|work=Glaciers of North America|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=July 8, 2012|format=pdf|date=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017213832/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|List of glaciers in South America}}
[[File:Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo]]]]
Glaciers in South America develop exclusively on the [[Andes]] and are subject of the Andes various climatic regimes namely the [[Tropical Andes]], [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Apart from this there is a wide range of latitudes on which glaciers develop from 5000 m in the [[Altiplano]] [[mountains]] and [[volcanoes]] to reaching sealevel as tidewater glaciers from [[San Rafael Lagoon]] (45° S) and southwards. South America hosts two large [[ice field]]s, the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s, of which the second is the largest contiguous body of glaciers in extrapolar regions.

The '''glaciers of Chile''' cover 2.7% (20,188&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210108/http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the land area of the country, excluding [[Antártica Chilena]], and have a considerable impact on its landscape and water supply. By surface 80% of South America’s glaciers lie in Chile. Glaciers develop in the [[Andes]] of Chile from 27˚S southwards and in a very few places north of 18°30'S in the extreme north of the country:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032056/http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in between they are absent because of extreme aridity, though [[rock glacier]]s formed from [[permafrost]] are common. The largest glaciers of Chile are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. From a latitude of 47° S and south some glaciers reach sea level.

Apart from height and latitude, the settings of Chilean glaciers depend on precipitation patterns; in this sense two different regions exist: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

[[File:Puncak Jaya glaciers 1850-2003 evolution map-fr.gif|thumb|right|Animated map of the extent of the glaciers of the [[Carstensz Glacier|Carstens Range]] from 1850 to 2003]]
No glaciers remain on the [[Australia]] mainland or [[Tasmania]]. A few, like the [[Heard Island glaciers]] are located in the territory of [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

[[New Guinea]] has the  [[Puncak Jaya#Glaciers|Puncak Jaya]] glacier.

[[New Zealand]] contains many [[glaciers]], mostly located near the Main Divide of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] in the [[South Island]]. They are classed as mid-latitude mountain glaciers. There are eighteen small glaciers in the [[North Island]] on [[Mount Ruapehu]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988),[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html Glaciers of New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html |date=2008-07-06 }}, in ''Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world'', U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, {{ISBN|0-607-71457-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9461">'''Parson-naturalists''' were [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers of religion]] who also studied [[natural history]]. The archetypical [[parson-naturalist]] was a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest in the Church of England]] in charge of a country parish, who saw the study of science as an [[Relationship between religion and science|extension of his religious work]]. The philosophy entailed the belief that God, as the Creator of all things, wanted man to understand his Creations and thus to study them through [[scientific technique]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; They often collected and preserved natural artefacts such as leaves, flowers, birds' eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals to classify and study. Some wrote books or kept nature diaries.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T. Sullivan | authorlink = |author2=John Baross  | title = Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = October 8, 2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

'''Loren Eiseley''' (September 3, 1907 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[anthropologist]], [[educator]], [[philosopher]], and [[natural science]] writer, who taught and published books from the 1950s through the 1970s. He received many [[honorary degree]]s and was a fellow of multiple professional societies. At his death, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

He was a "scholar and writer of imagination and grace," whose reputation and accomplishments extended far beyond the campus where he taught for 30 years. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' referred to him as "the modern [[Thoreau]]." The broad scope of his writing reflected upon such topics as the mind of [[Sir Francis Bacon]], the [[prehistoric]] origins of man, and the contributions of [[Charles Darwin]].

Eiseley's reputation was established primarily through his books, including ''The Immense Journey'' (1957), ''Darwin's Century'' (1958), ''The Unexpected Universe'' (1969), ''The Night Country'' (1971), and his memoir, ''All the Strange Hours'' (1975). Science author [[Orville Prescott]] praised him as a scientist who "can write with poetic sensibility and with a fine sense of wonder and of reverence before the mysteries of life and nature." Naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts saw his combination of literary and nature writings as his "quest, not simply for bringing together science and literature... but a continuation of what the 18th and 19th century British naturalists and Thoreau had done." In praise of "The Unexpected Universe", [[Ray Bradbury]] remarked, "[Eiseley] is every writer's writer, and every human's human... One of us, yet most uncommon..."  
 
According to his obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the feeling and philosophical motivation of the entire body of Eiseley's work was best expressed in one of his essays, ''The Enchanted Glass:'' "The anthropologist wrote of the need for the contemplative [[naturalist]], a man who, in a less frenzied era, had time to observe, to speculate, and to dream."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Blum, Howard. ''Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature'', ''New York Times'', (Obituary) July 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he received an award from the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and another from the U.S. [[Humane Society]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and environment in this country."

==Early life==
Born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], Eiseley lived his childhood with a hardworking father and deaf mother who may have suffered from [[mental illness]]. Their home was located on the outskirts of town where, as author Naomi Brill writes, it was "removed from the people and the community from which they felt set apart through poverty and family misfortune."&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;Brill, Naomi. [http://www.eiseley.org/biography.php Loren Eiseley Society (LES)]&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''All the Strange Hours'', begins with his "childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

His father, Clyde, was a hardware salesman who worked long hours for little pay, writes Brill. However, as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor, he was able to give his son a "love for beautiful language and writing."&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; His mother, Daisey Corey, was a self-taught prairie artist who was considered a beautiful woman. She lost her hearing as a child and sometimes exhibited irrational and destructive behavior. This left Eiseley feeling distant from her and may have contributed to his parents' unhappy marriage.

Living at the edge of town, however, led to Eiseley's early interest in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby.&lt;ref name=Minn&gt;[[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603182329/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/eiseley_loren.html EMuseum's Eiseley biography] ([[Internet Archive]] of website defunct since 2011), Retrieved 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to a happier life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of ''[[Robinson Crusoe (novel)|Robinson Crusoe]]'', with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

Eiseley later attended the Lincoln Public Schools; in high school, he wrote that he wanted to be a [[nature writer]]. He would later describe the lands around Lincoln as "flat and grass-covered and smiling so serenely up at the sun that they seemed forever youthful, untouched by mind or time&amp;mdash;a sunlit, timeless prairie over which nothing passed but antelope or wandering bird."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; But, disturbed by his home situation and the illness and recent death of his father, he dropped out of school and worked at menial jobs.

Eiseley enrolled in the [[University of Nebraska]], where he wrote for the newly formed journal, ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', and went on [[archaeology]] digs for the school's [[natural history]] [[museum]], [[University of Nebraska State Museum|Morrill Hall]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;  In 1927, however, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and left the university to move to the western [[desert]], believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the [[Great Depression]]).&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;Eiseley, Loren. ''All the Strange Hours'', (1975) Scribner&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of life itself.&lt;ref name=Wentz&gt;Wentz, Richard E., [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 The American Spirituality of Loren Eiseley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182240/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 |date=2009-10-07 }} ''Christian Century'', April 25, 1984,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic career==
Eiseley eventually returned to the University of Nebraska and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[English studies|English]] and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Geology]]/[[Anthropology]]. While at the university, he served as editor of the literary magazine ''The Prairie Schooner'', and published his poetry and short stories. Undergraduate expeditions to western Nebraska and the southwest to hunt for fossils and human artifacts provided the inspiration for much of his early work. He later noted that he came to anthropology from paleontology, preferring to leave human burial sites undisturbed unless destruction threatened them.

Eiseley received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1937 and wrote his dissertation entitled "Three Indices of Quaternary Time and Their Bearing Upon Pre-History: a Critique", which launched his academic career.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He began teaching at the [[University of Kansas]] that same year. During [[World War II]], Eiseley taught anatomy to reservist pre-med students at Kansas.

In 1944 he left the University of Kansas to assume the role of head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. In 1947 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to head its Anthropology Department. He was elected president of the American Institute of Human [[Paleontology]] in 1949. From 1959 to 1961, he was [[Provost (education)|provost]] at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961 the University of Pennsylvania created a special interdisciplinary professorial chair for him.

Eiseley was also a fellow of many distinguished professional societies, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the time of his death in 1977, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, and the curator of the Early Man section at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]].&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;University of Pennsylvania Almanac, [http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v54/n10/eiseley.html Loren Eiseley’s 100th Birthday Celebration at the Penn Museum] October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  He had received thirty-six [[honorary degrees]] over a period of twenty years, and was the most honored member of the University of Pennsylvania since [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In 1976 he won the [[Bradford Washburn]] Award of the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and the [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] Medal from the [[Humane Society of the United States]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and the environment in this country."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Books==
In addition to his scientific and academic work, Eiseley began in the mid-1940s to publish the essays which brought him to the attention of a wider audience. Anthropologist Pat Shipman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the words that flowed from his pen... the images and insights he revealed, the genius of the man as a writer, outweigh his social disability. The words were what kept him in various honored posts; the words were what caused the students to flock to his often aborted courses; the words were what earned him esteemed lectureships and prizes. His contemporaries failed to see the duality of the man, confusing the deep, wise voice of Eiseley's writings with his own personal voice. He was a natural fugitive, a fox at the wood's edge (in his own metaphor)...&lt;ref name=Shipman&gt;Shipman, Pat. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D7113EF93AA2575BC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print An Anthropologist With Bite]''New York Times'', August 19, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eiseley published works in a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;Wisner, William. "The Perilous Self: Loren Eiseley And The Reticence Of Autobiography." Sewanee Review 113.1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley's essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father's hobby as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor may have had on Eiseley's writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.&lt;ref name=Franke&gt;Franke, Robert. Journal of American Culture. "A Great Stage, A Great Play: The Theatrical And Tragic In Loren Eiseley's Essays.", 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing Eiseley's writing, Richard Wentz wrote, "As the works of any naturalist might, Eiseley's essays and poems deal with the flora and fauna of [[North America]]. They probe the concept of evolution, which consumed so much of his scholarly attention, examining the bones and shards, the arrowpoints and buried treasures. Every scientific observation leads to reflection." &lt;ref name=Wentz /&gt;

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), author [[Michael Lind]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the rise of a self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people &amp;ndash; as well as the unlettered majority &amp;ndash; spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they spend a lot of time outdoors and know the names of the plants and animals they see... For all of his scientific erudition, Eiseley has a poetic, even cinematic, imagination.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Lind, Michael. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5634196&amp;live=1 NPR radio interview], October 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Purposes of his writings===
Richard Wentz describes what he feels are the significance and purposes of Eiseley's writings:&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;"For Loren Eiseley, writing itself becomes a form of contemplation. Contemplation is a kind of human activity in which the mind, spirit and body are directed in solitude toward some other. Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity &amp;ndash; to see things as they really are... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to make us feel that we are accompanying him on a journey into the very heart of the universe. Whether he is explicating history or commenting on the ideas of a philosopher, a scientist or a theologian, he takes us with him on a personal visit."

However, because of Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and his focus on nature and [[cosmology]], he was not accepted or understood by most of his colleagues. "You," a friend told him, "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never going to be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don't stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that's inadvisable." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===1950s===
;''The Immense Journey'' (1957)
His first book, ''The Immense Journey'', was a collection of writings about the history of humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a mass audience. It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages.&lt;ref name=proclamation/&gt; Besides being his first book, ''The Immense Journey'' was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; This book was originally published in 1946.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax discovery.

In the book Eiseley conveys his sense of wonder at the depth of time and the vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, reactions to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In ''The Immense Journey'', Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. [[Marston Bates]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Marston. "Science", 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author Orville Prescott wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider the case of Loren Eiseley, author of ''The Immense Journey'', who can sit on a mountain slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back in the dawn of the [[Age of mammals]] eighty million years ago:  'There by a tree root I could almost make him out, that shabby little [[Paleocene]] rat, eternal tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of anthropologists had not led me to expect. ... The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He offers an example of Eiseley's style: "There is no logical reason for the existence of a snowflake any more than there is for evolution. It is an apparition from that mysterious shadow world beyond nature, that final world which contains&amp;mdash;if anything contains&amp;mdash;the explanation of men and catfish and green leaves."&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times," ''New York Times'', December 27, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Darwin's Century'' (1958)
This book's subtitle is, "Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It." Eiseley documented that animal variation, extinction, and a lengthy history of the earth were observed from the 1600s onward. Scientists groped towards a theory with increasingly detailed observations. They became aware that evolution had occurred without knowing how. Evolution was "in the air" and part of the intellectual discourse both before and after ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published. The publisher describes it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the account is Charles Darwin, but the story neither begins nor ends with him. Starting with the seventeenth-century notion of the [[Great Chain of Being]], Dr. Eiseley traces the achievements and discoveries of men in many fields of science who paved the way for Darwin; and the book concludes with an extensive discussion of the ways in which Darwin's work has been challenged, improved upon, and occasionally refuted during the past hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' back cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persons whose contributions are discussed include [[Sir Thomas Browne]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Carl Linnaeus]],  [[Benoît de Maillet]], the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[James Hutton]], [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Sir Charles Lyell]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], [[William Charles Wells|William Wells]], [[Patrick Matthew]], [[Karl von Baer]], [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]], [[Alexander Humboldt]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Hugo De Vries]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen|W. L. Johannsen]], [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Quételet]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Critics discussed include [[Fleeming Jenkin]], [[Alfred William Bennett|A.W. Bennett]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[Adam Sedgwick]], both a mentor and a critic.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century'' as a whole&lt;/ref&gt;

According to naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts, in the "seminal" ''Darwin's Century'', Eiseley was studying the history of evolutionary thinking, and he came to see that "as a result of scientific studies, nature has become externalized, particularized, mechanized, separated from the human and fragmented, reduced to conflict without consideration of cooperation, confined to [[reductionist]] and [[positivist]] study." The results for humankind, "as part of the '[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]' &amp;ndash; Eiseley's concern as a writer &amp;ndash; are far reaching." In the book, his unique impact as a thinker and a literary figure emerges as he reexamines science and the way man understands science. She concludes that, for Eiseley, "Nature emerges as a [[metonym]] for a view of the physical world, of the 'biota,' and of humankind that must be reexamined if life is to survive."&lt;ref name=Pitts&gt;Pitts, Mary Ellen. ''Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science'', Lehigh University Press (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conclusion, Eiseley quotes Darwin: "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, suffering and famine&amp;mdash;our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements&amp;mdash;they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor&amp;mdash;we may be all melted together." Eiseley adds, "If he had never conceived of natural selection, if he had never written the ''Origin,'' it would still stand as a statement of almost clairvoyant perception."&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' page 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science|Phi Beta Kappa prize for best book in science]] in 1958.

===1960s===
;''The Firmament of Time'' (1960) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2UaKo_vGjRAC Read excerpts online]
In discussing ''The Firmament of Time'', Professor of Zoology Leslie Dunn wrote, "How can man of 1960, burdened with the knowledge of the world external to him, and with the consciousness that scientific knowledge is attained through continually interfering with nature, 'bear his part' and gain the hope and confidence to live in the new world to which natural science has given birth? ... The answer comes in the eloquent, moving central essay of his new book."&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Leslie C. "Natural Law and Science," ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' wrote, "Dr. Eiseley describes with zest and admiration the giant steps that have led man, in a scant three hundred years, to grasp the nature of his extraordinary past and to substitute a natural world for a world of divine creation and intervention... An irresistible inducement to partake of the almost forgotten excitements of reflection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398|title=The Firmament of Time|first1=Loren|last1=Eiseley|first2=Gary|last2=Holthaus|date=1 May 1999|publisher=Bison Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Chicago Tribune'' added, "[This book] has a warm feeling for all natural phenomena; it has a rapport with man and his world and his problems; ... it has hope and belief.

{{see also|The Star Thrower}}

Poet [[W.H. Auden]] wrote, "The main theme of ''The Unexpected Universe'' is Man as the Quest Hero, the wanderer, the voyager, the seeker after adventure, knowledge, power, meaning, and righteousness."&lt;ref name=Auden&gt;Auden, W.H.[http://southerncrossreview.org/44/auden-eiseley.htm Introduction to ''The Star Thrower'']&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes from the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war... Mostly the animals understand their roles, but man, by comparison, seems troubled by a message that, it is often said, he cannot quite remember or has gotten wrong... Bereft of instinct, he must search continually for meanings... Man was a reader before he became a writer, a reader of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] once called the mighty alphabet of the universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] described Dr. Eiseley as

{{quote|...a [[Proust]] miraculously turned into an evolutionary anthropologist...", and science fiction novelist [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote glowing reviews of many of his books including this one. ... "Here he writes from a naturalist's perspective on the unexpected and symbolic aspects of the universe. Read about seeds, [[hieroglyphs]] on shells, the [[Ice Age]], lost tombs, city dumps and primitive Man. The underlying theme is the desolation and renewal of our planet's history and experience.

Loren Eiseley's dark, brooding prose is unique in the annals of nature writing. ''The Unexpected Universe'' features some of what are considered Eiseley's best essays. Heavily autobiographical and deeply personal, these essays are not cheerful ramblings on the joy of communing with nature. They are bleak, lonely musings on the human condition.}}

===1970s===
;''The Invisible Pyramid (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukuhJFtLugcC Read excerpts online]
Gregory McNamee of Amazon.com writes, "In 1910 young Loren Eiseley watched the passage of [[Halley's Comet]] with his father. The boy who became a famous naturalist was never again to see the spectacle except in his imagination. That childhood event contributed to the profound sense of time and space that marks ''The Invisible Pyramid''. This collection of essays, first published shortly after Americans landed on the moon, explores inner and outer space, the vastness of the cosmos, and the limits of what can be known. Bringing poetic insight to scientific discipline, Eiseley makes connections between civilizations past and present, multiple universes, humankind, and nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley took the occasion of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know only a little more extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western technological culture that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Gregory [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/080326738X Amazon.com book description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man would not be man if his dreams did not exceed his grasp. ... Like [[John Donne]], man lies in a close prison, yet it is dear to him. Like Donne's, his thoughts at times overleap the sun and pace beyond the body. If I term humanity a [[slime mold]] organism it is because our present environment suggest it. If I remember the sunflower forest it is because from its hidden reaches man arose. The green world is his sacred center. In moments of sanity he must still seek refuge there. ... If I dream by contrast of the eventual drift of the star voyagers through the dilated time of the universe, it is because I have seen [[thistle]]down off to new worlds and am at heart a voyager who, in this modern time, still yearns for the lost country of his birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;''The Night Country (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hsf0wbVJz8wC Read excerpts online]
[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote,

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;like the medievalists, Eiseley reads nature as the second book of God's revelation, mysterious and heavy with latent, lurking fertility. His sizable audience should welcome the latest voyage in search of the secret springs of creativity - evolutionary, cosmic, mental - as a muted adumbration of temporal mortality." Other reviews: "Eiseley has met strange creatures in the night country, and he tells marvelous stories about them ... For Eiseley, storytelling is never pure entertainment. The autobiographical tales keep illustrating the theses that wind through all his writing - the fallibility of science, the mystery of evolution, the surprise of life.|''Time Magazine''}}

{{quote|A sort of Odyssey by a man in dialogue with nature and evolution; Eiseley remains one of our foremost humanists-and prose stylists.|''Christian Century''}}

In a published essay, University of Pennsylvania alumnus Carl Hoffman wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;An old man who had done almost all of his writing late, late at night, was speaking to a younger man who liked to read in those same dark hours. In a chapter entitled 'One Night's Dying,' Eiseley said to me: 'It is thus that one day and the next are welded together, and that one night's dying becomes tomorrow's birth. I, who do not sleep, can tell you this.' Today, well into my fifties, in the midst of a lifetime of almost compulsive reading, I still regard ''The Night Country'' as my all-time favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Carl.

"In ''All the Strange Hours''," states Amazon.com,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley turns his considerable powers of reflection and discovery on his own life to weave a compelling story, related with the modesty, grace, and keen eye for a telling anecdote that distinguish his work. His story begins with his childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents. From there he traces the odyssey that led to his search for early postglacial man—and into inspiriting philosophical territory—culminating in his uneasy achievement of world renown. Eiseley crafts an absorbing self-portrait of a man who has thought deeply about his place in society as well as humanity's place in the natural world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;''The Star Thrower'' (1978)
His friend and science fiction author [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote, "The book will be read and cherished in the year 2001. It will go to the Moon and Mars with future generations.

===Posthumous===
;''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NfmoHi4-M-cC&amp;output=html Read excerpts online]
Just before his death Eiseley asked his wife to destroy the personal notebooks which he had kept since 1953. However, she compromised by disassembling them so they couldn't be used. Later, after great effort, his good friend Kenneth Heuer managed to reassemble most of his notebooks into readable form. ''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' includes a variety of Eiseley's writings including childhood stories, sketches while he was a vagabond, old family pictures, unpublished poems, portions of unfinished novels, and letters to and from literary admirers like [[W.H. Auden]], [[Howard Nemerov]], [[Lewis Mumford]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].

In a review of the book, author Robert Finch writes, "Like [[Herman Melville|Melville]], Eiseley thought of himself, and by extension all mankind, as 'an orphan, a wood child, a changeling,' a cosmic outcast born into a world that afforded him no true home." He adds that his "distinctive gift as a writer was to take powerfully formative personal influences of family and place and fuse them with his intellectual meditations on universal topics such as evolution, human consciousness and the weight of time. ... he found metaphors that released a powerful view of man's fate in the modern world." As Kenneth Heuer writes, "there are countless examples of Eiseley's empathy with life in all its forms, and particularly with its lost outcasts...the love that transcends the boundaries of species was the highest spiritual expression he knew.&lt;ref name=Notebook&gt;Finch, Robert. ''New York Times'', September 20, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Finch adds, "We are grateful for a life and a sensibility that would be welcome in any age, but never more so than in our increasingly depersonalized world. ... he made a generation of readers 'see the world through his eyes.' In an undated passage, circa 1959, Eiseley wrote, 'Man is alone in the universe...Only in the act of love, in rare and hidden communion with nature, does man escape himself.'" ''The Lost Notebooks'' contains numerous examples of his "creative and sympathetic imagination, even when that creation takes place in the solitude of journals never meant for public eyes."&lt;ref name=Notebook/&gt;

From other reviews: "Eiseley has rightly been called 'the modern [[Thoreau]].'" –''Publishers Weekly;'' "[an] extensive and enlightening glimpses ... into the intellectual and emotional workshop of one of the most original and influential American essayists of this century." –''New York Times Book Review;''  "Eiseley's great genius for the art of the word coupled with a poetic insight into the connection between science and humanism shines through in page after page... This is a book that will be read and quoted and whose pages will grow thin with wear from hands in continued search of new meaning within its words and images." –''Los Angeles Times;''  "it will enhance any dedicated reader's knowledge of this most remarkable literary naturalist... They provide more than a glimpse into Eiseley's mind and imagination." –''The Bloomsbury Review;''   "It is a joy, like finding a lost Rembrandt in the attic, to discover that Eiseley left behind a legacy." –''San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.''&lt;ref&gt;Book review of ''The Lost Notebooks'' [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 University of Nebraska Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073946/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance ==

===Religion ===
Richard Wentz, professor of religious studies, noted that ''The Christian Century'' magazine called attention to a study of Loren Eiseley by saying: "The religious chord did not sound in him, but he vibrated to many of the concerns historically related to religion." Wentz adds, "Although Eiseley may not have considered his writing as an expression of American spiritually, one feels that he was quite mindful of its religious character. As an heir of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]], he is at home among the poets and [[philosopher]]s and among those scientists whose observations also were a form of contemplation of the universe."

But Wentz considered the inherent contradictions in the statements: "We do not really know what to do with religiousness when it expresses itself outside those enclosures which historians and social scientists have carefully labeled religions. What, after all, does it mean to say, "the religious chord does not sound in someone," but that the person vibrates to the concerns historically related to religion? If the person vibrates to such concerns, the chord is religious whether or not it manages to resound in the temples and prayer houses of the devout."&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Wentz quotes Eiseley, from ''All the Strange Hours'' and ''The Star Thrower'', to indicate that he was, in fact, a religious thinker:

{{quote|I am treading deeper and deeper into leaves and silence. I see more faces watching, non-human faces. Ironically, I who profess no religion find the whole of my life a religious pilgrimage.

The religious forms of the present leave me unmoved. My eye is round, open, and undomesticated as an owl's in a primeval forest -- a world that for me has never truly departed.

Like the toad in my shirt we were in the hands of God, but we could not feel him; he was beyond us, totally and terribly beyond our limited- senses.

Man is not as other creatures and. . . without the sense of the holy, without compassion, his brain can become a gray stalking horror -- the deviser of [[Belsen]].}}

Wentz encompasses such quotes in his partial conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was indeed a scientist – a bone hunter, he called himself. [[Archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]] and naturalist, he devoted a great deal of time and reflection to the detective work of scientific observation. However, if we are to take seriously his essays, we cannot ignore the evidence of his constant meditation on matters of ultimate order and meaning.&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Eiseley wrote eloquent books from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/blog/ritualizing-big-history  |title=Ritualizing Big History March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolution===
Wentz writes, "Loren Eiseley is very much in the tradition of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. He takes the circumstances of whatever "business" he is about as the occasion for new questioning, new searching for some sign, some glimpse into the meaning of the unknown that confronts him at every center of existence." He quotes Eiseley from ''The Star Thrower'', "We are, in actuality, students of that greater order known as nature. It is into nature that man vanishes." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

In comparing Eiseley with Thoreau, he discusses clear similarities in their life and philosophies. He notes that Eiseley was, like Thoreau, a 'spiritual wanderer through the deserts of the modern world.' However, notes Wentz, "Thoreau had left the seclusion of [[Walden Pond]] in order to pace the fields of history, sorting out the artifacts that people had dropped along the way." But "it was those 'fossil thoughts' and 'mindprints' that Eiseley himself explored in his wanderings. These explorations gave depth, a tragic dimension and catharsis to what he called the 'one great drama that concerns us most, the supreme mystery, man.'"&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Eiseley's writing often includes his belief that mankind does not have enough evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In ''The Immense Journey'', he writes, "…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there." According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life . . . ."  and that "the human version of evolutionary events [is] perhaps too simplistic for belief." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Science and progress===
Eiseley talked about the illusions of science in his book, ''The Firmament of Time'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientist writing around the turn of the century remarked that all of the past generations of men have lived and died in a world of illusion. The unconscious irony in his observation consists in the fact that this man assumed the progress of science to have been so great that a clear vision of the world without illusion was, by his own time, possible. It is needless to add that he wrote before [[Einstein]]... at a time when [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] was just about to be rediscovered, and before the advances in the study of radioactivity...&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, Robert L. ''Is God the Only Reality?'', Templeton Foundation Press (1994), quoted by, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wentz noted Eiseley's belief that science may have become misguided in its goals: "Loren Eiseley thought that much of the modern scientific enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites." Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, "It would be well, he tells us, to heed the message of the [[Buddha]], who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future.' Spaces within stretch as far as those without." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Purpose for mankind===
"In essay after essay," writes Wentz, "he writes as a [[magus]], a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] master or a [[shaman]] who has seen into the very heart of the universe and shares his healing vision with those who live in a world of feeble sight. We must learn to see again, he tells us; we must rediscover the true center of the self in the otherness of nature."  &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

==Death and burial==
[[Image:Eiseley-headstone.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loren Eiseley's headstone in West Laurel Hill Cemetery - "We loved the earth but could not stay"]]
Loren Eiseley died July 9, 1977, of cardiac arrest following surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DD1F39E334BC4952DFB166838C669EDE |title=Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature |publisher=Blum, Howard, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1977 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[West Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]]. Eiseley's wife, Mabel Langdon Eiseley, died July 27, 1986, and is buried next to him, in the Westlawn section of the cemetery, in Lot 366. The inscription on their headstone reads, "We loved the earth but could not stay", which is a line from his poem ''The Little Treasures''.

A library in the [[Lincoln City Libraries]] [[public library]] system is named after Eiseley.

Loren Eiseley was awarded the Distinguished Nebraskan Award and inducted into the [[Nebraska Hall of Fame]]. A bust of his likeness resides in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]].

==Legacy==
In summarizing some of Eiseley's contributions, the editor of ''The Bloomsbury Review'' wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no question that Loren Eiseley maintains a place of eminence among nature writers. His extended explorations of human life and mind, set against the backdrop of our own and other universes are like those to be found in every book of nature writing currently available... We now routinely expect our nature writers to leap across the chasm between science, natural history, and poetry with grace and ease. Eiseley made the leap at a time when science was science, and literature was, well, literature... His writing delivered science to nonscientists in the lyrical language of earthly metaphor, irony, simile, and narrative, all paced like a good mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 25, 2007, the Governor of Nebraska, [[Dave Heineman]], officially declared that year "The Centennial Year of Loren Eiseley."  In a written proclamation, he encouraged all Nebraskans

&lt;blockquote&gt;to read Loren Eisely's writings and to appreciate in those writings the richness and beauty of his language, his ability to depict the long, slow passage of time and the meaning of the past in the present, his portrayal of the relationships among all living things and his concern for the future.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;Heineman, Dave, Governor of Nebraska.

'''National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day''' was created by the [[Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association]] to help raise awareness of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies and to celebrate how far the industry has come as well as the vast potential the technologies have today and in future. 

October 8th (10.08) was chosen in reference to the atomic weight of hydrogen (1.008).

National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day was officially launched on October 8, 2015.

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

==Branches of natural science==
{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David.

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13480">'''Naturalistic pantheism''' is a kind of [[pantheism]]. It has been used in various ways such as to relate [[God]] or divinity with concrete things,&lt;ref&gt;Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language by Quentin Smith, 1998, Yale University Press, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; determinism,&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries by [[Paul Tillich]], Mark K. Taylor, Mark Lewis Taylor, Collins, 1987, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; or the substance of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Panentheism"&gt;Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers, John W. Cooper, Baker Academic, 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; God, from these perspectives, is seen as the aggregate of all unified natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Lectures on Divine Humanity by Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov, Lindisfarne Press, 1995, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has often been associated with the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Marvin&gt;''The history of European philosophy: an introductory book'' by Walter Taylor Marvin, Macmillan Company, 1917, p.&amp;nbsp;325: “Naturalistic pantheism had already made its appearance in the sixteenth century and most notably in the writings of Giordano Bruno; but its most famous teacher was the seventeenth century philosopher Benedict Spinoza.”&lt;/ref&gt; although academics differ on how it is used.

==Component definitions==
The term “pantheism" is derived from Greek words ''pan'' (Greek: πᾶν) meaning "all" and ''theos'' (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Thomson]]; ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to English by Irish writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' that described pantheism as the "opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe."&lt;ref name=Toland&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: the father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "naturalistic" derives from the word "[[Naturalism (disambiguation)|naturalism]]", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;A Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. T. Mautner, Blackwell, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, ''i.e.'' the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

==Early conceptions==
[[Joseph Needham]], a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified [[Taoism]] as "a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, Joseph Needham, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Russell.

The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of [[Stoicism]] (which started in the early 3rd century BCE)&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven.&lt;ref name="Panentheism" /&gt; However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=John W.|title=Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|year=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|page=16|quote=Naturalistic pantheism anticipates Bruno, Spinoza, Toland, Einstein (not Schelling, Hegel) defining God in terms of Nature should not be construed as naturalistic pantheism. By "Nature" Eriugena means something like "Reality" rather than the mere physical universe. "But his position is in fact closer to the naturalistic pantheism of ancient Stoicism. The World-Soul is not a higher reality that generates the physical world but the rational causal agent immanent in the world"...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt; including [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for his views.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William (prof. of philosophy at the Catholic University), "History of Philosophy", 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt;

===Baruch Spinoza===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
Possibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;Elements of general philosophy By George Croom Robertson, p. 282
:"The pantheistic element in Descartes’ thought viz. the tendency to conceive the notion of substance in the truest sence as being only One, and the naturalistic element, viz. the tendency to conceive the One Substance of God as Order of Nature, were brought together and set in the front of Spinoza’s thought as the mother-idea of it all…Spinoza’s philosophy remains as yet and is likely to remain, the very type of a Naturalistic Pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza]] connected God and Nature through the phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("God, or Nature"),&lt;ref&gt;Elements of General Philosophy, George Croom Robertson, John Murray, 1896, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Theology by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; making him the father of [[classical pantheism]]. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophies of History: Meeting of East and West in Cycle-pattern ... Grace Edith Cairns, 1962
:This attitude is close to that of Spinoza's naturalistic pantheism in the West although Spinoza reached it by the more characteristically Western method, rationalism, versus the intuitive way of the Taoists&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as [[Spinozism]], has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the [[Pantheism controversy]]. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural.&lt;ref name=Pafumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pafumi|first=G.R.|title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1441590404|page=153|quote=Spinoza = naturalistic pantheism — universe as a "single, interconnected, and solely natural substance."}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:“In the criticism of his system we meet with the same difficulties that we find in Spinoza, i.e., the nature of the mind and of matter, the character of their interaction and the doctrine of determinism. Both Spinoza and Spencer teach a pure Naturalism … The two theories set forth are phases of Realistic or Naturalistic Pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature.&lt;ref&gt;
Goethe, Nietzsche, And Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love And Power by T. K. Seung, p. 11
:“The second function of the Earth Spirit was to clarify Goethe’s own version of pantheism. With the revival of Spinoza’s philosophy, naturalistic pantheism became a groundswell for the German intellectuals of Goethe’s generation. Although they rejected the other world, many of them subscribed to an idealistic or Romantic view of Nature, which Goethe regarded as an unreal view of reality…”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five great skeptical dramas of history by John Owen (theologian), 1896, p. 13
:“If he could be said to have owned a master of philosophy it was Spinoza. Of none other does he speak in such terms of commendation … In all probability Spinoza found his greatest disciple on the road to a naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ethics by Adolf Wuttke (theologian), 1876, p. 289, p. 327
:“Spinoza exerted in his own age but little influence. Notwithstanding the deep spiritually-moral declension of that dark period, the religious God-consciousness was as yet too vital to fall in with this naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press... Page 5
:"the naturalistic pantheism he then or somewhat later learned from Spinoza"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.&lt;ref&gt;Nothingness in the theology of Paul Tillich and Karl Barth by Sung Min Jeong University Press of America, 2003, p. 24
:"Spinoza establishes a naturalistic pantheism. Tillich considers Spinoza’s substance as a category"...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Finger Thomas (prof of religious thought), "Philosophy and religious belief", 1970, p. 92
:"..two forms of pantheism we have distinguished, idealistic monism and naturalistic pantheism. Here we shall consider only the naturalistic pantheism we have been describing, especially that of Spinoza."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The riddle of the universe by Edward Douglas, London: Fawcett, 1893, p. 30
:"Spinoza carried philosophy into the realms of a naturalistic pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In 1705 the Irish writer [[John Toland]] endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Materialism in Eighteenth-Century European Thought" in New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, 2005, ed. Peter Machamer and Francesca di Poppa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Works of John Dewey, Volume 2, SIU Press, 1976, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

German naturalist [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Haeckel – Britannica Concise" (biography), ''Encyclopædia Britannica Concise'', 2006, Concise.

Randolph, 1896, p217&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pantheist Movement]], started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[metaphysical naturalism|strong naturalism]], and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is your spiritual home right here on Earth?|url=http://www.pantheism.net|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21294">The '''Peterson Field Guides''' (PFG) are a popular and influential series of [[United States|American]] [[field guide]]s intended to assist the [[layman]] in identification of birds, plants, insects and other natural phenomena. The series was created and edited by renowned [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] (1908–1996). His inaugural volume was the classic 1934 book ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', published (as were all subsequent volumes) by the [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].

The PFG series utilized what became known as the [[Peterson Identification System]], a practical method for field identification which highlights readily noticed visual features rather than focusing on the technical features of interest to scientists.  The series both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging [[environmental movement]].

Most books in this series use a section of plates of drawings (usually reduced from commissioned paintings) rather than photographs of the subject species, grouped at the center of the book. This allows for idealized portraits that highlight the identifying "field marks" of each species; such field marks are often indicated by arrows or straight lines in the plate illustrations. However, in several books in this series, the plates consist of photographs (usually without such arrows or indicators), such as in the guides for the atmosphere, coral reefs, rocks and minerals, and the (old Charles Covell 1984 guide to) Eastern moths. In many books in this series (especially older editions), a number of the plates are in black and white. For examples, older editions of the Eastern reptiles/amphibians book had many black and white plates which were colorized for the current edition,&lt;ref&gt;Conant, Roger; and Collins, Joseph. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1998 pp viii, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the original 1934 Eastern bird book had only 4 color plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |title=A Book-collector’s Guide to Roger Tory Peterson &amp;#124; Roger Tory Peterson Institute |publisher=Rtpi.org |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909003834/http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one book (insects) was entirely in black and white. However, most newer editions are often full-color (or almost full-color) and tend to be larger. One source claims that the increased size of one of the new editions (Eastern reptiles/amphibians) was considered detrimental to its use as a field guide by its own author and was a publisher decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/78484/in_memoriam_roger_conant_19092003_with_reflections_by_some_of/ |title=In Memoriam: Roger Conant (1909-2003) With Reflections By Some of Roger's Many Friends and Colleagues - Science News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, new "editions" in this series are entirely new books with completely new texts and illustrations. For example, the fourth edition of the mammals guide has an entirely new text and illustrations by new author Fiona Reid, because the author (William Burt) and illustrator (Richard Grossenheider) of previous editions are both deceased. In fact, Grossenheider died prior to the publication of the ''previous'' third edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, William H; and Grossenheider, Richard P. A Field Guide to the Mammals of North America North of Mexico. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co; 1976. p vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the current Northeastern moths guide by David Beadle and Seabrooke Leckie is an entirely new book than the out-of-print 1984 Eastern moths guide by Charles Covell.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seabrookeleckie.com/the-new-peterson-moth-guide/ |title=The new Peterson moth guide |publisher=Seabrooke Leckie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beadle/Leckie book covers a smaller geographical area and (one author claims) covers moths in greater detail.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt; The old Covell book has been out-of-print for many years, but is currently available through the Virginia Museum of Natural History (which purchased the rights to that book).&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmnh.net/news.cfm?ID=193 |title=What's New &amp;#124; Virginia Museum of Natural History |publisher=Vmnh.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above situation of an old "edition" persisting alongside its intended replacement edition is not unique to the Eastern moths guide. [[George A. Petrides|George Petrides]]' 1988 Eastern trees book (PFG11B) was originally intended to replace Petrides' own 1958 Eastern tree and shrubs (PFG11A) book. However, both books remain popular and the original publisher still offers both books for sale (unlike the case of the old Eastern moths book).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmhbooks.com/peterson/plants.cfm |title=Peterson Field Guides(R)- Birds |publisher=Hmhbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between editions can serve to indicate changes in scientific perspective as well as changes species distribution. For example, the second edition of the freshwater fishes guide by Page and Burr (2011), published 20 years after the first edition, increased the number of species included from 768 to 909, largely due to the addition of previously unrecognized species (114), as well as increased numbers of newly established exotic species (16).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/freshwater/fieldguide.html Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes" Florida Museum of Natural History.] flmnh.ufl.edu. Retrieved 2014-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded coverage of marine fish commonly found in freshwater (19).

'''Photophoresis''' denotes the phenomenon that small particles suspended in [[gas]] (aerosols) or [[liquids]] (hydrocolloids) start to migrate when illuminated  by a sufficiently intense beam of [[light]]. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a [[fluid]] medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shahram Tehranian et al. 2001. Photophoresis of micrometer-sized particles in the free-molecular regime. International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 44, 1649.&lt;/ref&gt; Separately from photophoresis, in a fluid mixture of different kinds of particles, the migration of some kinds of particles may be due to differences in their absorptions of thermal radiation and other thermal effects collectively known as [[thermophoresis]]. In laser photophoresis, particles migrate once they have a refractive index different from their surrounding  medium. The migration of particles is usually possible when the laser is slightly or not focused. A particle with a higher refractive index compared to its surrounding  molecule moves away from the light source due to momentum transfer from absorbed and scattered light photons. This is referred to as a [[radiation pressure]] force. This force depends on light intensity and particle size but has nothing to do with the surrounding medium. Just like in [[Crookes radiometer]], light can heat up one side and gas molecules bounce from that surface with greater velocity, hence push the particle to the other side. Under certain conditions, with particles of diameter comparable to the wavelength of light, the phenomenon of a negative indirect photophoresis occurs, due to the unequal heat generation on the laser irradiation between the back and front sides of particles, this produces a temperature gradient in the medium around the particle such that molecules at the far side of the particle from the light source may get to heat up more, causing the particle to move towards the light source.&lt;ref&gt;Hitoshi WATARAI et al. 2004.Migration Analysis of Micro-Particles in Liquids Using Microscopically Designed External Fields. Analytical Sciences, Vol 20, p 423.re&lt;/ref&gt;

If the suspended particle is rotating, it will also experience the [[Yarkovsky effect]].

Discovery of photophoresis is usually attributed to [[Felix Ehrenhaft]] in the 1920s, though earlier observations were made by others including [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]].

==Applications of photophoresis==

The applications of photophoresis expand into the various divisions of science, thus physics, chemistry as well as in biology. Photophoresis is applied in particle trapping  and levitation,&lt;ref&gt;M. Rosenberg, D.A. Mendis, D.P. Sheehan.1999. Positively charged dust crystals induced by radiative heating, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci.27, 239-242&lt;/ref&gt; in the field flow fractionation of particles,&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Kononenko, J.K. Shimkus, J.C. Giddings, M.N. Myers. (1997). Feasibility studies on photophoretic effect in field flow fractionation of particles, J. Liquid Chromatogr.  Related Technol. 20, 2907-2929&lt;/ref&gt; in the determination of thermal conductivity and temperature of microscopic grains&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zhang, E. Bar-Ziv. (1997). A novel approach to determine thermal conductivity of micrometre-sized fuel particles, Combust. Sci.Technol.130, 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the  transport of soot  particles in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rohatschek. (1997). Levitation of stratospheric and mesospheric aerosols by gravito-photophoresis, J. Aerosol Sci. 27,467-475.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of light in the separation of particles [[aerosols]] based on their optical properties, makes possible the separation of  organic and inorganic particles of the same [[aerodynamic size]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, photophoresis has been suggested as a chiral sorting mechanism for single walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith. (2014). Photophoretic separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes: a novel approach to selective chiral sorting, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2014,16, 5221-5228.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed method would utilise differences in the absorption spectra of semiconducting carbon nanotubes arising from optically excited transitions in electronic structure. If developed the technique would be orders of magnitudes faster than currently established ultracentrifugation techniques.

==Theory of photophoresis==

Direct photophoresis is caused by the transfer of photon momentum to a particle by refraction and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkin, A. 2000 [[IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics]], 6,841-856.&lt;/ref&gt; Movement of particles in the forward direction occurs when the particle is transparent and has an [[index of refraction]] larger compared to its surrounding medium.&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect photophoresis occurs as a result of an increase in the kinetic energy of molecules when particles absorb incident light only on the irradiated side, thus creating a temperature gradient within the particle. In this situation the surrounding gas layer reaches temperature equilibrium with the surface of the particle. Molecules with higher kinetic energy in the region of higher gas temperature impinge on the particle with greater momenta than molecules in the cold region; this causes a migration of particles in a direction opposite to the surface temperature gradient. The component of the photophoretic force responsible for this phenomenon is called the radiometric force.&lt;ref&gt;YU. I. Yalamov, V. B. Kutukov, and E. R. Shchukin, "Theory of the Photophoretic Motion of the Large-Size Volatile Aerosol Particle," Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, vol. 57, pp. 564-571, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This comes as a result of uneven distribution of radiant energy (source function within a particle).
Indirect photophoretic force depends on the physical properties of the particle and the surrounding medium.

For pressures &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where the free mean path of the gas is much larger than the characteristic size &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; of the suspended particle (direct photophoresis), the longitudinal force is &lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C. and Husmann, T. (2016). Photophoresis on particles hotter/colder than the ambient gas for the entire range of pressures, Journal of Aerosol Science, 102:55, 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.08.013&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{phot} = -\frac{\pi}{3} \, \alpha \, \alpha_\text{m} \frac{p}{\sqrt{\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^\text{out}}\,T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}}} \, r_0^2 \, 	\frac{I\,J_1}{\frac{k}{r_0}+4\sigma_\text{SB}\varepsilon\,T_{\text{black body}}^3} \, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean temperature of the scattered gas is (thermal accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, momentum accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^{\text{out}}} = T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}+\alpha\left(T_{\text{black body}}-T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the black body temperature of the particle (net light flux &lt;math&gt;I=\varepsilon\,I_0&lt;/math&gt;, Stefan Boltzmann constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{SB}}&lt;/math&gt;, temperature of the radiation field &lt;math&gt;T_{\text{opt}}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\text{black body}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{I_0}{4\sigma_{\text{SB}}}+T_{\text{opt}}^4}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity of the particle.
The asymmetry factor for spheres &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; (positive longitudinal photophoresis).
For non-spherical particles, the average force exerted on the particle is given by the same equation where the radius &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is now the radius of the respective volume-equivalent sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C., Wurm, G., Teiser, J., Friedrich, J. M., and Bischoff,

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers, particularly advocates of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]], promote the view that causation in biological systems is inherently reciprocal.&lt;ref name="Laland2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2015|volume=282|page=20151019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harvard evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] (1961)&lt;ref name="Mayr1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=Cause and effect in biology|journal=Science|date=1961|volume=134|pages=1501-1506|bibcode=1961Sci...134.1501M|doi=10.1126/science.134.3489.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, [[Proximate and ultimate causation|‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’]]. Ultimate causes (e.g. [[natural selection]]) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. [[physiology]]) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayr, 1980&lt;ref name="Mayr1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=E|editor1-last=Mayr|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Provine|editor2-first=WB|title=The Evolutionary Synthesis|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA|pages=1-48|chapter=Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate [[dichotomy]] within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate-ultimate distinction]] implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West-Eberhard, 2003&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: [[genotypes]] cause [[phenotypes]] (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] cause changes in [[organisms]] (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt; (see also &lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=D|title=The proximate and the ultimate: past, present, and future|journal=Behav Process|date=1999|volume=46|pages=189-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierry|first1=B|title=Integrating proximate and ultimate causation: just one more go!|journal=Curr Sci|date=2005|volume=89|pages=1180-1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. 

==Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology==
Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary [[evolutionary biology]], including [[sexual selection]] theory, [[coevolution]], habitat selection, and [[frequency-dependent selection]]. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a [[Peafowl|peacock]]’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen [[mate choice]] decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.

Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]], or [[epigenetic inheritance]]) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. [[niche construction]]), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to [[natural selection]] of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of [[adaptive evolution]]. This goes beyond the recognition that [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic processes]] can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Contention==
Acceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology)]], [[niche construction]], [[cultural evolution]], human cooperation, and the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|last9=Wray|first9=GA|last10=Hoekstra|first10=HE|last11=Futuyma|first11=DJ|last12=Lenski|first12=RE|last13=Mackay|first13=TFC|last14=Schluter|first14=D|last15=Strassmann|first15=JE|title=Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=514|pages=161-164|bibcode=2014Natur.514..161L|doi=10.1038/514161a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R|title=Extended phenotype—but not too extended.

'''Rubble''' is broken [[rock (geology)|stone]], of irregular size, shape&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rubble |volume=23 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally found in the soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare [[cornbrash]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rubble" def. 2., "Brash n. 2. def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.

[[Image:Wyggestons Chantry House, rubblework.jpg|thumb|Rubble-work on [[Newarke Houses Museum|Wyggeston's Chantry House]] in [[Leicester]], built c. 1511]]

"[[Rubble-work]]" is a name applied to several types of [[masonry]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown together in a wall between boards and [[grout]]ed with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] almost like [[concrete]], is called in [[Italian language|Italian]] "muraglia di getto" and in [[French language|French]] "bocage".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In Pakistan, walls made of rubble and concrete, cast in a formwork, are called 'situ', which probably derives from Sanskrit (similar to the Latin 'in situ' meaning 'made on the spot').

Work executed with more or less large stones put together without any attempt at [[Course (architecture)|courses]] is called rubble&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; walling. Where similar work is laid in courses, it is known as coursed rubble. [[Dry-stone wall]]ing is somewhat similar work done without the use of mortar. It is bound together by the fit of the stones and the regular placement of stones which extend through the thickness of the wall. A rubble wall built with mortar will be stronger if assembled in this way.

===Rubble walls in Malta===
[[File:Ta' Dmejrek-IMG 1500.jpg|thumb|Rubble wall near [[Dingli]], [[Malta]]]]

Rubble walls ({{lang-mt|ħitan tas-sejjieħ}}) are found all over the island of [[Malta]]. Similar walls are also frequently found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that were found in the area lying on the ground or in the soil.  It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. Rubble walls are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that  rubble walls offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many rubble walls on the side of the hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.

'''Scientism''' is an [[ideology]] that promotes [[science]] as the purportedly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] means by which society should determine [[normative]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] values. The term ''scientism'' is generally used critically, pointing to the cosmetic application of science in unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the [[scientific method]] or similar scientific standards.  

In [[philosophy of science]], the term ''scientism'' frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rey | first= Abel | title = Review of ''La Philosophie Moderne'' | journal = The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods |volume = 6.2 |date = 1909 | pages = 51–3 | doi= 10.2307/2011609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Abraham | last = Maslow | quote = There are criticisms of orthodox, 19th Century scientism and I intend to continue with this enterprise | title = Toward a Psychology of Being | chapter = Preface | edition = 1st|year=1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by social scientists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayek | title = The Counter Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason | publisher = Liberty Fund | date = June 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers of science such as [[Karl Popper]],&lt;ref name = Popper-Hacohen&gt;{{cite book |last = Hacohen|first = Malachi Haim| title = Karl Popper: the formative years, 1902–1945: politics and philosophy in interwar Vienna | date = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name= Putnam&gt;{{cite book| last= Putnam| first= Hilary | title = Renewing Philosophy |date= 1992|publisher= Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tzvetan Todorov]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov, Tzvetan]]. ''The Imperfect Garden: the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 20. "Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does."&lt;/ref&gt; to describe (for example) the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methodology and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22&gt;{{Citation | last = Outhwaite | first = William | origyear = 1988 | title = Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers | publisher = Polity Press | edition = 2nd | date = 2009 | page = 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, scientism is often interpreted as science applied "in excess". The term ''scientism'' has two senses:

# The improper usage of [[science]] or scientific claims.{{Sfn | Peterson | 2003 | p = 753 | ps =: 'the best way to understand the charge of scientism is as a kind of logical fallacy involving improper usage of science or scientific claims'}}  This usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = Denver | url = http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html | title = Scientism | first = Martin | last = Ryder | publisher = University of Colorado | accessdate = July 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630205732/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|deadurl=yes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and in contexts where there is insufficient [[empirical evidence]] to justify a scientific conclusion. It includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific. This can be a [[counterargument]] to [[argument from authority|appeals to scientific authority]]. It can also address the attempt to apply "hard science" methodology and claims of certainty to the [[social science]]s, which Friedrich Hayek described in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' (1952) as being impossible, because that methodology involves attempting to eliminate the "human factor", while social sciences (including his own field of [[economics]]) center almost purely on [[praxeology|human action]].

W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-34411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes used to describe universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that [[empirical science]] constitutes the most authoritative [[worldview]] or the most valuable part of human learning—to the complete exclusion of other viewpoints, such as historical, philosophical, economic or cultural worldviews. It has been defined as "the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society".&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley (Eds), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper Collins, 1999, p.775&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''scientism'' is also used by historians, philosophers, and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive [[reductionism]] in all fields of human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Collins | title = A Critical Analysis of Competency-based Systems in Adult Education | journal = Adult Education Quarterly | date = March 20, 1983 | volume = 33 | number = 3 | pages = 174–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Irwin | last = Chargaff | title = In Dispraise of Reductionism | journal = BioScience | volume = 47 | number = 11 |date= Dec 1997 | pages = 795–7 | doi= 10.2307/1313101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R Keith | last = Sawyer | title = Connecting Culture, Psychology and Biology: Essay Review on Inghilleri's From Subjective Experience to Cultural Change | journal = Human Development | volume = 43 | date =  2000 | pages = 56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Republic"&gt;{{cite web|last= Wieseltier|first= Leon|title= Crimes Against Humanities|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/114548/leon-wieseltier-responds-steven-pinkers-scientism|accessdate= 21 December 2013|date=4 September 2013|quote= His essay, a defense of "scientism," is a long exercise in assimilating humanistic inquiries into scientific ones.

For [[social theorist]]s in the tradition of [[Max Weber]], such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]], the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of [[positivism]], but also to the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] for modern [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunkhorst|first= Hauke|title= On Max Horkheimer: New Perspectives|date= 1995|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 0262522071|pages= 74|editor= Seyla Benhabib|editor2= Wolfgang Bonss|editor3= John McCole|chapter= Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British novelist [[Sara Maitland]] has called scientism a "myth as pernicious as any sort of [[fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

Reviewing the references to scientism in the works of contemporary scholars, Gregory R. Peterson&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Gregory R.|title=Demarcation and the Scientistic Fallacy |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science |date=2003|volume=38|issue=4|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2003.00536.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; detects two main broad themes:
# It is used to criticize a totalizing view of science as if it were capable of describing ''all'' [[reality]] and [[knowledge]], or as if it were the ''only'' true way to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things;
# It is used, often pejoratively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term scientism is ordinarily used with pejorative intent. | first = Donald R | last = Peterson | title = Science, Scientism, and Professional Responsibility | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 196–210 |date=June 2004 | doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term 'scientism' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense | first = C | last = Hakfoort | title = Science deified: Wilhelm Osstwald's energeticist world-view and the history of scientism | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | date = 1992 | pages = 525–44 | doi=10.1080/00033799200200441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Scientism... a term of abuse since [[Friedrich Hayek]] first popularized it in the 1940s. | first = Robert C | last = Bannister | title = Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1940 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | date = 1991 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  to denote a border-crossing violation in which the theories and methods of one (scientific) discipline are inappropriately applied to another (scientific or non-scientific) discipline and its domain. An example of this second usage is to label as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values (a traditional domain of [[ethics]]) or as the source of [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and purpose (a traditional domain of [[religion]] and related [[worldviews]]).

The term ''scientism'' was popularized by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winner [[F.A. Hayek]], who defined it as the "slavish imitation of the method and language of Science".&lt;ref name="Hayek1942"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayek |first=F. A. v. |date=1942 |title=Scientism and the Study of Society. Part I |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2549540 |journal=Economica |volume=9 |issue=35 |pages=267–291 |doi=10.2307/2549540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper defines scientism as "the aping of what is widely mistaken for the method of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/objectiveknowled00popp |title=Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach |last=Popper |first=Karl R. |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press |edition=Revised |lccn=79318586 |ol=OL4489088M|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mikael Stenmark]] proposes the expression ''scientific expansionism'' as a synonym of scientism.&lt;ref name="expansionism"&gt;{{Citation | first = Mikael | last = Stenmark | contribution = Scientism | editor-first = J Wentzel Vrede | editor-last = van Huyssteen | title = Encyclopedia of science and religion | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Gale | date = 2003 | page = 783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of science and religion'', he writes that, while the [[doctrine]]s that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition, they share the idea that the boundaries of science (that is, typically the natural sciences) could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science (usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension).&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt;

According to Stenmark, the strongest form of scientism states that science has no boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor, with due time, will be dealt with and solved by science alone.&lt;ref name ="expansionism"/&gt; This idea has also been called the [[Myth of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = G | last1 = Monastra | first2 = MM | last2 = Zarandi | title = Science and the Myth of Progress | date = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. F. Schumacher]], in his ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted, measured and weighed. "The architects of the modern worldview, notably [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]], assumed that those things that could be weighed, measured, and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified. If it couldn't be counted, in other words, it didn't count."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.schumachersociety.org/publications/orr_92.html | first = David | last = Orr | contribution = Environmental Literacy: Education as if the Earth Mattered | title = Twelfth Annual EF Schumacher Lectures |date=October 1992 | place = Great Barrington, [[Massachusetts|MA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual historian [[T.J. Jackson Lears]] argues there has been a recent reemergence of "nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified 'science' has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies." Lears specifically identifies Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]'s work as falling in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lears|first=T.J.

Gray]] and [[Thomas Nagel]] have leveled similar criticisms against popular works by moral psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]], neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Knowns and the Unknowns|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/102760/righteous-mind-haidt-morality-politics-scientism|publisher=The New Republic|date= 20 April 2012|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=These theories show the continuing appeal of scientism—the modern belief that scientific inquiry can enable us to resolve conflicts and dilemmas in contexts where traditional sources of wisdom and practical knowledge seem to have failed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=Malcolm Gladwell Is America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115467/malcolm-gladwells-david-and-goliath-fairy-tales|publisher=The New Republic|date= 22 November 2013|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=... the mix of moralism and scientism is an ever-winning formula, as Gladwell's career demonstrates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.

Genetic biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote in conservative journal ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'' that scientism has much in common with superstition: "the stubborn insistence that something...has powers which no evidence supports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Austin| last = Hughes| title = The Folly of Scientism | journal = The New Atlantis | date = Fall 2012 | volume = 37 | pages = 32–50 | url = https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-folly-of-scientism | access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to debates about science and religion==
Several scholars use the term to describe the work of vocal critics of religion-as-such. Individuals associated with [[New Atheism]] have garnered this label from both religious and non-religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Marilynne | title = Hysterical Scientism: The Ecstasy of Richard Dawkins | newspaper = Harper's Magazine |date=Nov 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stephen LeDrew on his 'The Evolution of Atheism' an Interview | url = http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5325 |date= 10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[John Haught]] argues that [[Daniel Dennett]] and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of [[scientific naturalism]], which holds the central dogma that "only nature, including humans and our creations, is real: that God does not exist; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haught argues that this belief system is self-refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Philosopher Peter Williams argues that it is only by conflating science with scientism that new atheists feel qualified to "pontificate on metaphysical issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Peter S.|title=C.S. Lewis vs. the New Atheists|date=2013|publisher=Paternoster|page=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] responded to religious criticism of his book ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'' by saying that accusations of scientism "[are] an all-purpose, wild-card smear... When someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don't like, they just try to discredit it as 'scientism'. But when it comes to [[facts]], and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | first = Sholto | last = Byrnes | title = When it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 10 April 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131703/http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | archive-date = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious scholars have also linked New Atheist thought with scientism. Atheist philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] conflates all empirical knowledge with that of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=He says that the discovery of moral truth depends on science, but this turns out to be misleading, because he includes under "science" all empirical knowledge of what the world is like...Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] argues that [[Christopher Hitchens]] possesses an "old-fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence" that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] has also criticized New Atheist philosopher [[Alexander Rosenberg]]'s ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality'' for resurrecting a self-refuting [[epistemology]] of [[logical positivism]] and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|title=True Believers|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=June 2012|quote=The main tenets of this philosophy are bracingly summed up in a series of questions and answers: Is there a God? No. What is the nature of reality? What physics says it is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], draws a parallel between scientism and traditional religious movements, pointing to the [[cult of personality]] that develops around some scientists in the public eye. He defines scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations, eschews [[supernatural]] and [[paranormal]] speculations, and embraces empiricism and [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shermer | first = Michael | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AA74F-FF5F-1CDB-B4A8809EC588EEDF | title = The Shamans of Scientism | journal = [[Scientific American]] |date=June 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian scholar [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] has stated that in the [[Western world]], many will accept the [[ideology]] of modern science, not as "simple ordinary science", but as a replacement for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chittick | first = William | title = The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington | date = 2007 | isbn = 1-933316-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory R. Peterson writes that "for many theologians and philosophers, scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins".&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"/&gt;

==Philosophy of science==
{{main article|Philosophy of science}}
In his essay ''Against Method'', [[Paul Feyerabend]] characterizes science as "an essentially anarchic enterprise"{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = vii | ps =: '[[Imre Lakatos]] loved to embarrass serious opponents with jokes and irony and so I, too, occasionally wrote in a rather ironical vein. An example is the end of Chapter 1: 'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history'}} and argues emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly over "dealing in knowledge" and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self-defined tradition. He depicts the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination, aimed at "making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more 'objective' and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules."{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii, 9, 11]}}

{{quotation|[S]cience can stand on its own feet and does not need any help from [[rationalist]]s, [[secular humanist]]s, [[Marxist]]s and similar religious movements; and... non-scientific cultures, procedures and assumptions can also stand on their own feet and should be allowed to do so... Science must be protected from ideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be protected from science... In a democracy scientific institutions, research programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected to public control, there must be a separation of state and science just as there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and science should be taught as one view among many and not as the one and only road to truth and reality.|Feyerabend|''Against Method''|p. viii{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii]}}}}

==Rhetoric of science==
{{main article|Rhetoric of science}}
Thomas M. Lessl argues that religious themes persist in what he calls scientism, the [[public rhetoric]] of science.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"/&gt; There are two methodologies that illustrate this idea of scientism. One is the epistemological approach, the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing and the ontological approach, that the rational mind reflects the world and both operate in knowable ways. According to Lessl, the ontological approach is an attempt to "resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism". Lessl also argues that without scientism, there would not be a scientific culture.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessl|first=Thomas M.|title=Naturalizing science: Two episodes in the evolution of a rhetoric of scientism|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=Fall 1996|volume=60|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.1080/10570319609374555}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3/5/2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and philosophy==
Philosopher of religion [[Keith Ward]] has said scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even [[self-refuting]], as the truth of the statements "no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)" or "no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true" cannot themselves be proven scientifically, logically, or empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Ward | author-link = Keith Ward | title = [[Is Religion Dangerous?]]|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William P |last=Alston |chapter=Religious language and verificationism |editor-first=Paul K |editor-last=Moser |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Copan |title= The Rationality of Theism |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-415-26332-8 |pages= 26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalization and modernity==
{{Main article|Rationalization (sociology)}}
In the introduction to his collected oeuvre on the [[sociology of religion]], [[Max Weber]] asks why "the scientific, the artistic, the political, or the economic development [elsewhere]… did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the Occident?" According to the distinguished German social theorist, [[Jürgen Habermas]], "For Weber, the intrinsic (that is, not merely [[contingent]]) relationship between [[modernity]] and what he called 'Occidental rationalism' was still self-evident." Weber described a process of rationalisation, [[disenchantment]] and the "disintegration of religious world views"  that resulted in modern [[secularisation|secular]] societies and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Habermas1990"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"Modernization" was introduced as a technical term only in the 1950s. It is the mark of a theoretical approach that takes up Weber's problem but elaborates it with the tools of social-scientific [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]… The theory of modernization performs two abstractions on Weber's concept of "modernity". It dissociates "modernity" from its modern European origins and stylizes it into a spatio-temporally neutral model for processes of social development in general. Furthermore, it breaks the internal connections between modernity and the historical context of Western [[rationalism]], so that processes of modernization… [are] no longer burdened with the idea of a completion of modernity, that is to say, of a goal state after which "[[postmodern]]" developments would have to set in.  …Indeed it is precisely modernization research that has contributed to the currency of the expression "postmodern" even among social scientists.||author=[[Jürgen Habermas]]|title=''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]''}}

Habermas is critical of pure [[instrumental rationality]], arguing that the "Social Life–World" is better suited to literary expression, the former being "intersubjectively accessible experiences" that can be generalized in a [[formal language]], while the latter "must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case":&lt;ref name="Olson2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Olson |date=2008 |title=Science and scientism in nineteenth-century Europe |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-07433-2 |lccn= 2007005146 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h8C7fe50J0AC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last = Habermas |first2=JJ |last2=Shapiro |date=1971 |title=Toward a rational society: student protest, science, and politics | format = paperback |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4177-2 |lccn= 73121827 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cW7PmVj7kzQC&amp;pg=PA50 |pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation |The world with which literature deals is the world in which human beings are born and live and finally die; the world in which they love and hate, in which they experience triumph and humiliation, hope and despair; the world of sufferings and enjoyments, of madness and common sense, of silliness, cunning and wisdom; the world of social pressures and individual impulses, of reason against passion, of instincts and conventions, of shared language and unsharable feelings and sensations…||author=[[Aldous Huxley]]|title=''[[Literature and Science]]''}}

The '''Seven Wonders of Canada''' was a 2007 competition sponsored by [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[CBC News: The National|The National]]'' and [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]''. They sought to determine Canada's "seven wonders" by receiving nominations from viewers, and then from on-line voting of the short list. After the vote, a panel of judges, [[Ra McGuire]], Roy MacGregor and Roberta L. Jamieson, picked the winners based on geographic and poetic criteria. Their seven picks were revealed on ''[[CBC News: The National|The National]]'' on June 7, 2007. The Seven Wonders as chosen by Canada were the Sleeping Giant, Niagara Falls, the Bay of Fundy, Nahanni National Park Reserve, the Northern Lights, the Rockies, and the Cabot Trail.

      <comment>This video doesn’t show sonoluminescence. It shows combustion due to adiabatic heating as in a Diesel engine, for example. For some reason this “bullet in gel” effect is widely called sonoluminescence on YouTube and other places even though it directly contradicts this article which states the bubbles are only 1 micron in size.</comment>

[[File:Single bubble cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Single-bubble sonoluminescence – a single, cavitating bubble.]]'''Sonoluminescence''' is the emission of short bursts of light from [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploding]] [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s in a liquid when excited by sound.

==History==
The sonoluminescence effect was first discovered at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1934 as a result of work on [[sonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Single Bubble Sonoluminsescence|journal= Aps Northwest Section Meeting Abstracts|pages= D1.007|author= Farley, Jennifer; Hough, Shane|date=2003|bibcode=2003APS..NWS.D1007F}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Frenzel]] and [[H. Schultes]] put an ultrasound [[transducer]] in a tank of photographic [[developer fluid]]. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment of a large number of short-lived bubbles. (This experiment is also ascribed to N.&amp;nbsp;Marinesco and J.&amp;nbsp;J. Trillat in 1933, which also credits them with independent discovery). This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).

In 1960 Dr. Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of SL phenomenon. The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.

In 1989 an experimental advance was introduced by [[D. Felipe Gaitan]] and [[Lawrence Crum]], who produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more [[system]]atic study of the [[phenomenon]], because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt [[steel]], as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about 12,000 [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ndiaye|first=Abdoul Aziz|last2=Pflieger|first2=Rachel|last3=Siboulet|first3=Bertrand|last4=Molina|first4=John|last5=Dufrêche|first5=Jean-François|last6=Nikitenko|first6=Sergey I.|date=2012-05-24|title=Nonequilibrium vibrational excitation of OH radicals generated during multibubble cavitation in water|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=116|issue=20|pages=4860–4867|doi=10.1021/jp301989b|issn=1520-5215|pmid=22559729|bibcode=2012JPCA..116.4860N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner [[temperature]] of such a bubble well above one million [[kelvin]]s was postulated.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] indicate temperatures around {{convert|20000|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name=Illinois/&gt;

==Properties==
[[Image:Sonoluminescence.jpg|right|thumb|Long exposure image of multi-bubble sonoluminescence created by a high-intensity [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] horn immersed in a beaker of liquid]]

Sonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.

Some facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1–{{val|10|ul=mW}}.
* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light—about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter—depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).
* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities]].
* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.

Spectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.&lt;ref name=flannigan&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.

Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', chemists [[David J. Flannigan]] and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]] describe a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]. Using argon bubbles in [[sulfuric acid]], their data show the presence of ionized molecular oxygen O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[sulfur monoxide]], and atomic argon populating high-energy excited states, which confirms a hypothesis that the bubbles have a hot plasma core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David J. Flannigan  |author2=Kenneth S. Suslick |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Plasma formation and temperature measurement during single-bubble cavitation|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=52–55|year=2005|doi=10.1038/nature03361|pmid=15744295|issue=7029|bibcode = 2005Natur.434...52F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ionization]] and [[Excited state|excitation]] energy of [[Ozonide|dioxygenyl]] [[cations]], which they observed, is 18 [[electronvolt]]s. From this they conclude the core temperatures reach at least 20,000 kelvins.&lt;ref name=Illinois&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/05/0302bubbles.html |title=Temperature inside collapsing bubble four times that of sun &amp;#124; Archives &amp;#124; News Bureau &amp;#124; University of Illinois |publisher=News.illinois.edu |date=2005-02-03 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayleigh–Plesset equation==
:{{main|Rayleigh–Plesset equation}}
The dynamics of the motion of the bubble is characterized to a first approximation by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation (named after [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] and [[Milton S. Plesset|Milton Plesset]]):

:&lt;math&gt;R\ddot{R} + \frac{3}{2}\dot{R}^{2} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left(p_g - P_0 - P(t) - 4\mu\frac{\dot{R}}{R} - \frac{2\gamma}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is an approximate equation that is derived from the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] (written in [[spherical coordinate system]]) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble ''R'' as a function of time ''t''. Here, ''μ'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''γ'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse.  Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley P. Barber and Seth J. Putterman, "Light Scattering Measurements of the Repetitive Supersonic Implosion of a Sonoluminescing Bubble", Phys Rev Lett 69, 3839-3842 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh–Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.

==Mechanism of phenomenon==
{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}
The mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown. [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] include: hotspot, [[Bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung radiation]], collision-induced radiation and [[corona discharge]]s, [[nonclassical light]], [[Quantum tunnelling|proton tunneling]], [[electrodynamic]] [[Jet (fluid)|jets]] and [[fractoluminescence|fractoluminescent jets]] (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Image:Sonoluminescence.png|center|600px|thumb|From left to right: apparition of bubble, slow expansion, quick and sudden contraction, emission of light]]

In 2002, M. Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v74/i2/p425_1?"Single bubble sonoluminescence" (''Reviews of Modern Physics'' 74, 425)]&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20–40% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v80/i4/p865_1?"Evidence for Gas Exchange in Single-Bubble Sonoluminescence", Matula and Crum, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 80 (1998), 865-868)]&lt;/ref&gt; The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.

During bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).

Computations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.

Any discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v77/i23/p4816_1?"Sonoluminescence in High Magnetic Fields, J.B. Young, T. Schiemedel and Woowan Kang" (''Physical Review Letters'' 77, 4816)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other proposals===

====Quantum explanations====
An unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue1/colfusthe.html |title=Within article "Cold Fusion: A History of Mine" |publisher=Infinite-energy.com |date=1989-03-23 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more thoroughly considered in a paper by [[Claudia Eberlein]]&lt;ref&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3842–3845 (1996); https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9506024v1&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Sussex]]. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to [[Hawking radiation]], the radiation generated at the [[event horizon]] of [[black hole]]s. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains [[virtual particle]]s, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the [[Unruh effect]] or the [[Casimir effect]]. The argument has been made that sonoluminescence releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation,&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Milton, "Dimensional and dynamical aspect of the
Casimir effect: understanding the reality and significance
of vacuum energy", hep-th/0009173 (2000) https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0009173&lt;/ref&gt; although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;S.Liberati, F.Belgiorno, Matt Visser, "Comment on ``Dimensional and dynamical aspects of the Casimir effect: understanding the reality and significance of vacuum energy''", hep-th/0010140v1 (2000) https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0010140v1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear reactions====
{{main|Bubble fusion}}
Some have argued that the Rayleigh–Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins. Some research claims to have measured temperatures as high as 100,000 kelvins, and speculates temperatures could reach into the millions of kelvins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nature China |url=http://www.nature.com/nchina/2008/081015/full/nchina.2008.241.html |title=Sonoluminescence: Baking bubbles : Article : Nature China |publisher=Nature.com |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures this high could cause [[thermonuclear fusion]]. This possibility is sometimes referred to as [[bubble fusion]] and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.

On January 27, 2006, researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] claimed to have produced fusion in sonoluminescence experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/1322 |title=RPI: News &amp; Events – New Sonofusion Experiment Produces Results Without External Neutron Source |publisher=News.rpi.edu |date=2006-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060130155542.htm |title=Using Sound Waves To Induce Nuclear Fusion With No External Neutron Source |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in 2002 and 2005 by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|R. P. Taleyarkhan]] using deuterated [[acetone]] showed measurements of [[tritium]] and neutron output consistent with fusion.  However, the papers were considered low quality and there were doubts cast by a report about the author's scientific misconduct.  This made the report lose credibility among the scientific community.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-misconduct19-2008jul19,0,1765099.story Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct], Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H.

==Biological sonoluminescence==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Optical phenomenon]] --&gt;
[[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] (also called ''snapping shrimp'') produce a type of sonoluminescence from a collapsing bubble caused by quickly snapping its claw. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey. However, it is the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect and was whimsically dubbed "shrimpoluminescence" upon its discovery in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | pages = 477–478 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35097152 | title = Snapping shrimp make flashing bubbles |author1=Detlef Lohse, Barbara Schmitz  |author2=Michel Versluis  |lastauthoramp=yes | pmid = 11586346 | issue = 6855|bibcode = 2001Natur.413..477L }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the [[mantis shrimp]], contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.&lt;ref name="Patek and Caldwell"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.

[[File:06. Експерименти со стаклена инка.ogv|thumb|right|250px|An experiment with a glass funnel showing the action of [[vacuum]] on the ball caused by suction out of the funnel's stem. The ball is suspended and doesn't fall as long as there is suction.]]
'''Suction''' is the flow of a fluid into a partial [[vacuum]], or region of low pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tnuf0g6J5KEC&amp;pg=PA976&amp;dq=suction+is+flow+of+fluid+into+partial+vacuum+-pump&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyu9GZrcbUAhUBwmMKHUS1Cyw4ChDoAQg8MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=suction%20is%20flow%20of%20fluid%20into%20partial%20vacuum%20-pump&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Mechanical Science, Arts, Manufactures and Miscellaneous Knowledge|last=(LL.D.)|first=Alexander JAMIESON|date=1827|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pressure gradient force|pressure gradient]] between this region and the ambient pressure will propel matter toward the low pressure area. Dust is sucked into a [[vacuum cleaner]] when it is pushed in by the higher pressure air on the outside of the cleaner.

This is similar to what happens when humans breathe or drink through a [[drinking straw|straw]]. Both breathing and using a straw involve contracting the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and muscles around the rib cage. The increased volume in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity decreases the pressure inside, creating an imbalance with the ambient air pressure, or [[atmospheric pressure]]. This imbalance results in air pushing into the lungs or liquid pushing up through a straw and into the mouth.

==Pumps==
{{main|Pump}}
{{also|Suction pump}}
[[Pumps]] typically have an inlet where the fluid (or air) enters the pump and an outlet where the fluid/air comes out. The inlet location is said to be at the '''suction side''' of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the '''discharge side''' of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid/air can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid/air out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a [[centrifugal pump]] is too high, a device may trigger the fluid pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.

Under normal conditions of [[atmospheric pressure]] suction can draw pure water up to a maximum height of approximately 10.3 m (33.9 [[Foot (length)|feet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc="[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]"}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suction (medicine)|In medicine, suction]] devices are used to clear airways of materials that would like to impede breathing or cause infections, to aid in surgery, and for other purposes.

'''Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment''' ('''SELEX'''), also referred to as ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro selection|in vitro selection]]'' or ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro evolution|in vitro evolution]]'', is a [[combinatorial chemistry]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or ligands, which are commonly referred to as [[aptamer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hak-Hagir A | title = [The Hak-Hagir skin conduit] | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Urologie Und Nephrologie | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 639–42 | date = September 1978 | pmc = 362762 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.9.7.2944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as '''SAAB''' (selected and amplified binding site) and '''CASTing''' (cyclic amplification and selection of targets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Binder M, Funk W | title = Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) for the myogenin consensus binding site | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 4104–10 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1649388 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.11.8.4104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]] or target capture on paramagnetic beads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Schubert T, Strehlitz B | title = In vitro Selection and Interaction Studies of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Protein A | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0134403 | date = 2015-07-29 | pmid = 26221730 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0134403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-[[Nano-|nano]]molar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name="Carothers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW | title = Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 24 | pages = 7929–37 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16771507 | pmc = 4287982 | doi = 10.1021/ja060952q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YX, Kwon YJ | title = Aptamers: The "evolution" of SELEX | journal = Methods | volume = 106 | pages = 21–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27109056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe AD, Cload ST | title = SELEX with modified nucleotides | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–56 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644461 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library ===
The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizenga2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huizenga DE, Szostak JW | title = A DNA aptamer that binds adenosine and ATP | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 656–65 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7819261 | doi = 10.1021/bi00002a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target incubation ===
Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include [[affinity chromatography]] columns,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; nitrocellulose [[Filter binding assay|binding assay filters,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Dynabeads|paramagnetic beads.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete [[Confluency|confluence]] and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwagawa T, Ohuchi SP, Watanabe S, Nakamura Y | title = Selection of RNA aptamers against mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Biochimie | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 250–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22085640 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for [[Electric-field screening|charge screening]] to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non-specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good [[binding affinity]] for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]], which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Binding sequence elution and amplification ===
Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vater A, Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = Short bioactive Spiegelmers to migraine-associated calcitonin gene-related peptide rapidly identified by a novel approach: tailored-SELEX | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = e130 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576330 | pmc = 275487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by applying high heat and physical force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blank M, Weinschenk T, Priemer M, Schluesener H | title = Systematic evolution of a DNA aptamer binding to rat brain tumor microvessels. selective targeting of endothelial regulatory protein pigpen | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 19 | pages = 16464–8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11279054 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M100347200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Obtaining ssDNA===
One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as [[Exodeoxyribonuclease|Lambda exonuclease]]. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.&lt;ref name="Svobodová"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svobodová M, Pinto A, Nadal P, O' Sullivan CK | title = Comparison of different methods for generation of single-stranded DNA for SELEX processes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 3 | pages = 835–42 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22733247 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below.

=== Negative or counter selection ===
In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Reinemann C, Strehlitz B | title = SELEX--a (r)evolutionary method to generate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands | journal = Biomolecular Engineering | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 381–403 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17627883 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haller AA, Sarnow P | title = In vitro selection of a 7-methyl-guanosine binding RNA that inhibits translation of capped mRNA molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 16 | pages = 8521–6 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9238009 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking selection progression ===
To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sefah K, Shangguan D, Xiong X, O'Donoghue MB, Tan W | title = Development of DNA aptamers using Cell-SELEX | language = En | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20539292 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength absorbance&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caveats and considerations ===
Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubin AA, Hunt BV, White RJ, Plaxco KW | title = Effects of probe length, probe geometry, and redox-tag placement on the performance of the electrochemical E-DNA sensor | language = EN | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 2150–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19215066 | doi = 10.1021/ac802317k }}&lt;/ref&gt; An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name="Jarosch2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16855281 | pmc = 1524915 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified nucleotides ==
Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro VB, Taylor AI, Cozens C, Abramov M, Renders M, Zhang S, Chaput JC, Wengel J, Peak-Chew SY, McLaughlin SH, Herdewijn P, Holliger P | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079 | pages = 341–4 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517858 | pmc = 3362463 | doi = 10.1126/science.1217622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic alphabet, and thus possible aptamers, is also expanded using unnatural base pairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Kawai R, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = An unnatural base pair system for efficient PCR amplification and functionalization of DNA molecules | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = e14 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073696 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashige R, Kimoto M, Takezawa Y, Sato A, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Highly specific unnatural base pair systems as a third base pair for PCR amplification | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 2793–806 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22121213 | pmc = 3315302 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of these unnatural base pairs was applied to SELEX and high affinity DNA aptamers were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Yamashige R, Matsunaga K, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Generation of high-affinity DNA aptamers using an expanded genetic alphabet | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 453–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23563318 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

'''Vacuum deposition''' is a family of processes used to deposit layers of material atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule on a solid surface. These processes operate at pressures well below [[atmospheric pressure]] (i.e., [[vacuum]]). The deposited layers can range from a thickness of one atom up to millimeters, forming freestanding structures. Multiple layers of different materials can be used, for example to form [[optical coating]]s. The process can be qualified based on the vapor source; [[physical vapor deposition]] uses a liquid or solid source and [[chemical vapor deposition]] uses a chemical vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1533/9780857094698.1|chapter=Overview of coating technologies|title=Surface Modification by Solid State Processing|pages=1–24|year=2014|last1=Quintino|first1=Luisa|isbn=9780857094681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The vacuum environment may serve one or more purposes:
* reducing the particle density so that the [[mean free path]] for collision is long
* reducing the particle density of undesirable atoms and molecules (contaminants)
* providing a low pressure plasma environment
* providing a means for controlling gas and vapor composition
* providing a means for mass flow control into the processing chamber.

Condensing particles can be generated in various ways:
* thermal evaporation, [[Evaporation (deposition)]]
* [[sputtering]]
* [[cathodic arc deposition|cathodic arc vaporization]]
* [[laser ablation]]
* decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor, [[chemical vapor deposition]]

In reactive deposition, the depositing material reacts either with a component of the gaseous environment (Ti + N → TiN) or with a co-depositing species (Ti + C → TiC). A plasma environment aids in activating gaseous species (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2N) and in decomposition of chemical vapor precursors (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 4H). The plasma may also be used to provide ions for vaporization by sputtering or for bombardment of the substrate for sputter cleaning and for bombardment of the depositing material to densify the structure and tailor properties ([[ion plating]]).

== Types ==
When the vapor source is a liquid or solid the process is called [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD). When the source is a chemical vapor precursor, the process is called [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The latter has several variants: ''low-pressure chemical vapor deposition'' (LPCVD), [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD), and ''plasma-assisted CVD'' (PACVD). Often a combination of PVD and CVD processes are used in the same or connected processing chambers.

== Applications ==
* [[electric current|Electrical conduction]]: [[metallic film]]s, [[Transparent_conducting_film#Transparent_conducting_oxides|transparent conductive oxides]] (TCOs), [[superconducting film]]s &amp; coatings
* [[Semiconductor]] devices: semiconductor films, electrically insulating films
* [[Solar cell]]s.
* Optical films: [[anti-reflective coating]]s, [[filter (optics)|optical filters]]
* Reflective coatings: [[mirror]]s, [[hot mirror]]s
* [[tribology|Tribological]] coating: hard coatings, erosion resistant coatings, solid film lubricants
* [[Energy conservation]] &amp; generation: [[low emissivity]] glass coatings, solar absorbing coatings, mirrors, solar [[thin film]] [[solar cell|photovoltaic cells]], ''smart'' films
* [[Magnetic film]]s: [[magnetic storage|magnetic recording]]
* [[Diffusion barrier]]: [[gas permeation barrier]]s, [[vapor permeation barrier]]s, [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] [[diffusion barrier]]s
* [[Corrosion]] protection:
* [[automotive industry|Automotive]] applications:  lamp reflectors and trim applications
* Vinyl record pressing, manufacture of gold and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum records]]

A thickness of less than one [[micrometre]] is generally called a [[thin film]] while a thickness greater than one micrometre is called a coating.

[[File:Day5pressureforecast.png|thumb|right|250 px|Forecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the [[North Pacific]], North America, and the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]]]

'''Weather forecasting''' is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the [[weather]] informally for [[millennia]] and formally since the [[19th century]]. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative [[data]] about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using [[meteorology]] to project how the atmosphere will change.

Once calculated by hand based mainly upon changes in [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], current weather conditions, and sky condition or [[cloud]] cover, weather forecasting now relies on [[numerical weather prediction|computer-based models]] that take many atmospheric factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirmeyer|first1=Paul A.|last2=Schlosser|first2=C. Adam|last3=Brubaker|first3=Kaye L.|title=Precipitation, Recycling, and Land Memory: An Integrated Analysis|journal=Journal of Hydrometeorology|date=February 1, 2009|volume=10|issue=1|pages=278–288|doi=10.1175/2008JHM1016.1|bibcode=2009JHyMe..10..278D |hdl=1721.1/52326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, [[teleconnection]]s, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the [[chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the ''range'' of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.

There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on [[temperature]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are important to [[agriculture]], and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2009, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fostering Innovation, Creating Jobs, Driving Better Decisions: The Value of Government Data |date=July 2014 |publisher=Economics and Statistics Administration Office of the Chief Economist |page=15 |url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/fostering-innovation-creating-jobs-driving-better-decisions-value-government-data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Ancient forecasting===
For millennia people have tried to forecast the weather. In 650&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as [[astrology]]. In about 350&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Aristotle]] described weather patterns in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1994/5/94.05.01.x.html Meteorology by Lisa Alter]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Theophrastus]] compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the ''Book of Signs''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/cig/weather/forecasting-from-beginning.html "Weather: Forecasting from the Beginning"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China|Chinese]] weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[University of California]] Museum of Paleontology. [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html "Aristotle (384-322&amp;nbsp;B.C.E.)]". Retrieved 2008-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also around the same time ancient [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomers]] developed weather-prediction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indian and Pseudo-indian Passages in Greek and Latin Astronomical and Astrological Texts|author=[[David Pingree]]|pages=141–195 [143–4]|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/6861608670636388/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=2010-03-01|date=2017-12-14}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Testament times, Christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red', and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:2-3&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 16:2-3 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 904&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'', translated into Arabic from an earlier [[Aramaic]] work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrara|first1=A.A|title=Geoponica and Nabatean Agriculture: A New Approach into Their Sources and Authorship|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|volume=16|issue=1|page=123–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the [[lunar phase]]s; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|page=842}}, in {{Cite book |last1=Rashed |first1=Roshdi |last2=Morelon |first2=Régis |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-12410-2 |pages=813–852|title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce [[weather lore]]. However, not all{{which|date=April 2015}} of these predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.&lt;ref name=Skywatch&gt;{{cite web |author=Jerry Wilson |url=http://wilstar.com/skywatch.htm#indicators |title=Skywatch: Signs of the Weather |accessdate=2008-05-25 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130106041039/http://wilstar.com/skywatch.htm#indicators |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern methods===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 186783 Royal Charter (ship).jpg|thumb|The ''Royal Charter'' sank in an 1859 storm, stimulating the establishment of modern weather forecasting.]]
It was not until the invention of the [[Electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Hochfelder |year=1998 | url=http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph20.htm| title=Joseph Henry: Inventor of the Telegraph? |publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=2006-06-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060626163000/http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph20.htm |archivedate = June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160&amp;nbsp;km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120&amp;nbsp;km/day) (whether by land or by sea).&lt;ref name="USPS History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ausman|first=Megaera|title=USPS Historian|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/overland-mail.htm|work=About the United States Postal Service|publisher=USPS|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Mail coaches"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail|first=Royal|title=(UK)|url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/page/Mail-Coaches|work=British Postal Museum|publisher=Postal Heritage Trust|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-585850/telegraph "Telegraph"]. Retrieved 2007-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further [[Windward and leeward|upwind]].

The two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] [[Francis Beaufort]] and his [[protégé]] [[Robert FitzRoy]]. Both were influential men in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] naval and governmental circles, and though ridiculed in the press at the time, their work gained scientific credence, was accepted by the [[Royal Navy]], and formed the basis for all of today's weather forecasting knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Eric D. Craft |year=2003 | title = An Economic History of Weather Forecasting | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070503193324/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history | archivedate = May 3, 2007 | url = http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history | accessdate =April 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=The birth of the weather forecast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32483678 |publisher=BBC News |date=April 30, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort developed the [[Beaufort scale|Wind Force Scale]] and Weather Notation coding, which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend [[William Whewell]], expanded weather record-keeping at 200 British [[Coast guard]] stations.

Robert FitzRoy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the [[Board of Trade]] to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to [[sailor|mariners]]. This was the forerunner of the modern [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; All ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"&gt;Mellersh, H. E. L. (1968). FitzRoy of the Beagle. Hart-Davis. {{ISBN|0-246-97452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meyers b16 s0570.jpg|left|thumb|Weather map of Europe, December 10, 1887.]]
A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']] inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called ''"forecasting the weather"'', thus coining the term "weather forecast".&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"/&gt; Fifteen land stations were established to use the [[telegraph]] to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service. His warning service for shipping was initiated in February 1861, with the use of [[electric telegraph|telegraph communications]]. The first daily weather forecasts were published in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1861.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected.&lt;ref name="Kington"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future|first=John|last=Kington|editor=Mike Hulme and Elaine Barrow|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''"Weather Book"'' which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.

As the electric telegraph network expanded, allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using [[Photography#Science and forensics|photography]] were supplied to the observing stations from [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] – these cameras had been invented by [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1845 and his [[barograph]] had earlier been used by FitzRoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

To convey accurate information, it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by [[Luke Howard]] in 1802, and standardized in the ''[[International Cloud Atlas]]'' of 1896.

===Numerical prediction===
{{Main article|History of numerical weather prediction}}
It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [[numerical weather prediction]]. In 1922, English scientist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Lewis Fry, ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1922). Available on-line at: [https://archive.org/stream/weatherpredictio00richrich#page/n7/mode/2up Internet Archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised, to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found.

Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to [[numerical instability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lynch (meteorologist)|Lynch, Peter]] (2006). The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fjørtoft]], applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and [[ENIAC]] programmer [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Fjörtoft and von Neumann, 1950, Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation

===Broadcasts===

The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in ''[[The Times]]'' on August 1, 1861, and the first [[weather map]]s were produced later in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Helen Czerski |date=August 1, 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/23degrees/2011/08/150_years_since_the_first_uk_w.html |title=Orbit: Earth's Extraordinary Journey: 150 years since the first UK weather "forecast" |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the [[Met Office]] began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission. These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/1/f/Fact_sheet_No._8.pdf|title=National Meteorological Library and Fact Sheet 8 -- The Shipping Forecast|author=Met Office|date=2012|version=1|pages=3–5|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. "E.B." Rideout, on [[WEZE|WEEI]], the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston.&lt;ref name="cyc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401802621.html |title=meteorology Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about meteorology |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rideout came from the [[National Weather Service|U.S. Weather Bureau]], as did [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931.

The world's first [[Live television|televised]] weather forecasts, including the use of weather maps, were experimentally broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1936. This was brought into practice in 1949 after [[World War II]]. [[George Cowling]] gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/about/newsid_7833000/7833282.stm |title=BBC - Weather - A history of TV weather forecasts|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102193118/http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/about/newsid_7833000/7833282.stm|website=BBC Weather|archivedate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HUNT"&gt;Hunt, Roger, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/114277251/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 "The end of weather forecasting at Met Office London"], ''Weather'', June 2007, v.62, no.6, pp.143-146&lt;/ref&gt; In America, experimental television forecasts were made by James C Fidler in Cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the [[DuMont Television Network]].&lt;ref name="cyc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wforund.htm | title=Answers: Understanding weather forecasts | date=2006-02-08 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 80s, [[John Coleman (news weathercaster)|John Coleman]], the first weatherman on ABC-TV's [[Good Morning America]], pioneered the use of on-screen [[weather satellite]] information and [[computer graphics]] for television forecasts.&lt;ref name=CJR&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/cjr_rewind_hot_air.php CJR Rewind: Hot Air], ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', reprint, first published in the January/February 2010 issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman was a co-founder of [[The Weather Channel]] (TWC) in 1982. TWC is now a 24-hour cable network. Some weather channels have started broadcasting on [[Live broadcasting|live broadcasting programs]] such as [[YouTube]] and [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] to reach more viewers.

The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated [[weather station]]s at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in [[METAR]] reports,&lt;ref&gt;[[National Climatic Data Center]].

Models are ''initialized'' using this observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by [[data assimilation]] and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid).

These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This ''time stepping'' procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.

The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain [[numerical stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-554766-6|pages=285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZikIbXzipwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=time+step+numerical+weather+prediction#v=onepage&amp;q=time%20step%20numerical%20weather%20prediction&amp;f=false|page=132|title=Computational Science – ICCS 2005: 5th International Conference, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 22–25, 2005, Proceedings, Part 1|author1=Sunderam, V.

This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=222–224|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-471-38108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, a model is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-554766-6|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations—along with the [[ideal gas law]]—are used to evolve the [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[potential temperature]] [[scalar field]]s and the [[velocity]] [[vector field]] of the atmosphere through time.

Different models use different solution methods: some global models use [[spectral method]]s for the horizontal dimensions and [[finite difference method]]s for the vertical dimension, while regional models and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.&lt;ref name="finite"/&gt;

==Techniques==

===Persistence===
The simplest method of forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and [[Long range weather forecast|long range forecasts]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

===Use of a barometer===
Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[USA Today]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wbarocx.htm "Understanding air pressure"]. Retrieved 2008-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than {{convert|3.5|hPa|mmHg|lk=on|abbr=on}}, the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. [[High pressure area|Rapid pressure rises]] are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.&lt;ref&gt;Weather Doctor.

===Looking at the sky===
[[File:marestail.jpg|thumb|Marestail shows moisture at high altitude, signalling the later arrival of wet weather.]]
Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of [[cloud]] cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. High thin [[cirrostratus cloud]]s can create [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s around the [[sun]] or [[moon]], which indicates an approach of a [[warm front]] and its associated [[rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=halo+use+in+weather+forecasting+book&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=halo%20use%20in%20weather%20forecasting%20book&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |page=148 |title=Make Your Own Weather Forecasts |author=Dennis Eskow |date=March 1983 |volume=159 |issue=3 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morning [[fog]] portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation.

===Severe weather alerts and advisories===
A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Weather Service]]. [http://www.weather.gov/mission.shtml National Weather Service Mission Statement]. Retrieved 2008-05-25. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124214601/http://www.weather.gov/mission.shtml |date=November 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the [[Severe thunderstorm warning|severe thunderstorm]] and [[tornado warning]], as well as the [[Severe thunderstorm watch|severe thunderstorm]] and [[tornado watch]]. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, [[Flood warning|flood]], [[tropical cyclone]], and fog.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment Canada]]. [http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/cd/brochures/warning_e.cfm? "Weather watches, warnings and advisories"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703204148/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/cd/brochures/warning_e.cfm |date=2006-07-03 }} Retrieved 2008-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the [[Emergency Alert System]], which break into regular programming.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Communications Commission]]. [https://www.fcc.gov/general/emergency-alert-system-eas "Emergency Alert System"]. Retrieved 2008-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low temperature forecast===
The low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7{{nbsp}}pm that evening through 7{{nbsp}}am the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Weather Channel]] - [http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/32098-weather-com-is-the-low-before-or-after-the-high Calculation of Low Temperature Forecast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906012055/http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/32098-weather-com-is-the-low-before-or-after-the-high |date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, in short, today's forecasted low is most likely tomorrow's low temperature.

== Specialist forecasting ==
There are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users.

=== Air traffic ===

===Marine===
{{See also|Marine weather forecasting}}
Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example the [[MAFOR]] (marine forecast).&lt;ref&gt;Great Lakes and Seaway Shipping. [http://www.boatnerd.com/facts-figures/mafor.htm "MAFOR Weather Code"]. Retrieved 2008-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of [[RTTY]], [[Navtex]] and [[Radiofax]].

===Agriculture===
[[Farmer]]s rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying [[hay]] is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin [[cotton]], [[wheat]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair Fannin. [http://southwestfarmpress.com/news/061406-Texas-weather/ "Dry weather conditions continue for Texas"].

=== Forestry ===

Weather forecasting of wind, precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling [[wildfire]]s. Different indices, like the ''[[Forest fire weather index]]'' and the ''[[Haines Index]]'', have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.

===Utility companies===
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|right|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend).]]
{{Main article|Degree day}}
Electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand, which can be strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating ([[heating degree day]]) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities are based on a daily average temperature of {{convert|65|F}}. Cooler temperatures force heating degree days (one per degree Fahrenheit), while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Climate Prediction Center]]. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/cdus/degree_days/ddayexp.shtml "Degree Day Explanation"].

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning.

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by [[topography]], as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: 
* '''Ground''' fires are fed by subterranean roots, [[forest floor|duff]] and other buried [[organic matter]]. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as [[Peat#Peat Fires|peat fires]] in [[Kalimantan]] and Eastern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], which resulted from a [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|riceland creation project]] that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | title = Asian peat fires add to warming | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News | last = Rincon | first = Paul | date = 9 March 2005 | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219064000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crawling''' or '''surface''' fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation on the [[forest floor]] such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al'' ., iv, 10, 14&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires (less than {{convert|400|C|F}}) and may spread at slow rate, though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire on earth : an introduction|last=C.|first=Scott, Andrew|others=Bowman, D.

* '''Crown''', '''canopy''', or '''aerial''' fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses.

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a [[fire triangle]] come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as [[vegetation]], that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its [[fire point]].&lt;ref name = FireBehavior/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|title=The Science of Wildland fire|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=21 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105175208/http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|archivedate=5 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater [[humidity]], and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., 12"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants continuously lose water by [[evapotranspiration]], but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | title = Ashes cover areas hit by Southern Calif. fires | agency = Associated Press | publisher = MSNBC | date = 15 November 2008 | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033149/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | archivedate = 9 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.&lt;ref name=Structure&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | title = Influence of Forest Structure on Wildfire Behavior and the Severity of Its Effects | date = November 2003 | format = PDF | publisher = US Forest Service | accessdate = 19 November 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125731/http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | archivedate = 17 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | title = Prepare for a Wildfire | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) | accessdate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025706/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wildfire ''front'' is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the [[smolder]]ing transition between unburned and burned material.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation]].

The thermal heat from wildfire can cause significant [[weathering]] of rocks and boulders, heat can rapidly expand a boulder and [[thermal shock]] can occur, which may cause an object's structure to fail.

Intensity also increases during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;de Souza Costa and Sandberg, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.&lt;ref name=NOVA /&gt; Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[veld]] in southern Africa, the [[fynbos]] in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

High-severity wildfire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the [[chaparral]] in [[southern California]] and lower-elevation deserts in the American Southwest.

{{Main|Fire adaptations}}
Plants in wildfire-prone [[ecosystems]] often survive through adaptations to their local [[fire regime]]. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | title=Section Three: Problems, Cares, Economics, and Species | work=The Eucalyptus of California | first=Robert L. | last=Santos | publisher=California State University | date=1997 | accessdate=26 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | archivedate=2 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fire.

{{Further|Fossil record of fire}}
In the [[Welsh Borders]], the first evidence of wildfire is [[Rhyniophyta|rhyniophytoid]] plant fossils preserved as [[charcoal]], dating to the [[Silurian]] period (about {{ma|420}}).

Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons{{clarify|does this mean annual dry seasons or erratic droughts?|date=October 2015}} are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous [[progymnosperm]] forests.  [[Lepidodendron]] forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires.

As these grasses shifted to more [[mesic habitat]]s, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 595&lt;/ref&gt; However, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', ''Pinus'' and ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]'', which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ [[serotiny]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 596&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Scottish botanist [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]] noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers.

Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related [[debris flow]] in [[alluvial fan]]s of northeastern [[Yellowstone National Park]] was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the [[Medieval Warm Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G.A. |last2=Wells |first2=S.G.|last3=Jull|first3=A.J.T.|date=1995|title=Fire and alluvial chronology in Yellowstone National Park: Climatic and intrinsic controls on Holocene geomorphic processes|journal=GSA Bulletin|issue=10|pages=1211–1230 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107&lt;1211:FAACIY&gt;2.3.CO;2 |volume= 107 |bibcode = 1995GSAB..107.1211M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. [[Dendrochronological]] fire scar data and charcoal layer data in [[Finland]] suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pitkänen, ''et al.'', 15–16 and 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n10/full/ngeo313.html |title=Climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=697–702 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo313 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..697M |author=J.

Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. [[conifers]]) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in [[monoculture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-biodiversity-criticism-sweden-forest-industry.html Fires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/(httpNews)/531DAFFB8B319F69C125792E00499ED1 The Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[invasive species]], moved in by humans (i.e., for the [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industry]]) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as [[Eucalyptus]] in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.sc.us/forest/scplants.pdf Plant flammability list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firesafemarin.org/plants/fire-prone Fire-prone plant list]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gamba grass]] in Australia.

Wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources,&lt;ref name="van Wagtendonk, 14"/&gt; and to affect future fires.&lt;ref&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1156.&lt;/ref&gt; North American firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in Europe are related to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 7, 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires. Later posters of the program featured [[Uncle Sam]], characters from the Disney movie ''[[Bambi]]'', and the official mascot of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | title=Smokey's Journey | publisher=Smokeybear.com | accessdate=26 January 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306051136/http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | archivedate=6 March 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire.

Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Fire.

Wildfire itself is reportedly "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area" according to Jan van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1164&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger.&lt;ref name=Integration&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | format = PDF | title = An Integration of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Information Distribution for Wildfire Detection and Management | journal = Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | date = October 1998 | pages = 977–985 | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090816123809/http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | archivedate = 16 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fire lookout tower]]s were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, [[carrier pigeon]]s, and [[heliograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | title = Radio communication keeps rangers in touch | publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Digital Archives | date = 21 August 1957 | accessdate = 6 February 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813160525/http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerial and land photography using [[instant camera]]s were used in the 1950s until [[infrared photography|infrared scanning]] was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the [[incident commander|fire manager]]. During the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], a data station was established in [[West Yellowstone]], permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.&lt;ref name = Integration/&gt;

Currently, public hotlines, [[fire lookout]]s in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by [[asthenopia|operator fatigue]], time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data analyses. An integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless [[Incident Command System|Incident Command Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | title = Wildfire Detection and Control | publisher = Alabama Forestry Commission | accessdate = 12 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120135635/http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | archivedate = 20 November 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluation of three wildfire smoke detection systems", 4&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) which uses data from the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.

In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.

The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.

Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. [[Silver iodide]] can be used to encourage snow fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |title=China Makes Snow to Extinguish Forest Fire |publisher=FOXNews.com |accessdate=10 July 2009 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173448/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[fire retardant]]s and water can be dropped onto fires by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[airtanker|planes]], and [[helitack|helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP//projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2009 |title=Disaster Management Applications – Fire |first=Vincent G. |last=Ambrosia |publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center |date=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081427/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP/projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucinski, ''et al.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of {{convert|54500|km2|acre|sigfig=2|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |title=Fighting fire in the forest |publisher=CBS News |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212242/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | title = Climate of 2008 Wildfire Season Summary | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | date = 11 December 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023095354/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 – Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.&lt;ref name="homeslost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 – Land &amp; Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildland firefighting safety ===
[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]
Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref name=niosh-blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot Tips from NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000&amp;ndash;2016, more than 350&amp;nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC - Fighting Wildfires - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=May 31, 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000-2016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt; Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

==Fire retardant==
Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Agueda |author2=E. Pastor |author3=E. Planas |year=2008|title=Different scales for studying the effectiveness of long-term forest fire retardants|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=782–796|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.   In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magill, B.|title=Officials: Fire slurry poses little threat|work=Coloradoan.com|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20120706/NEWS01/307060035/Officials-Fire-slurry-poses-little-threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers.  Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boerner, C. |author2=Coday B. |author3=Noble, J. |author4=Roa, P. |author5=Roux V. |author6=Rucker K. |author7=Wing, A. |year=2012 |title=Impact of wildfire in Clear Creek Watershed of the city of Golden's drinking water supply |publisher=Colorado School of Mines |url=http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021046/http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt; Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eichenseher, T.|year=2012|title=Colorado Wildfires Threaten Water Supplies|work=National Geographic Daily News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084010/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt;

Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).  After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.

===Modeling===

Wildfire modeling is concerned with [[numerical simulation]] of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://firegrowthmodel.ca/  | title = Prometheus  | publisher = Tymstra, C.; Bryce, R.W.; Wotton, B.M.; Armitage, O.B. 2009.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.&lt;ref&gt;G.D. Richards, "An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution", Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.. 30:1163–1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extreme value theory]] may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires. However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.&lt;ref name="Alvarado, et al., 66-68"&gt;Alvarado, ''et al''., 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human risk and exposure==
{{wide image|2009 California Wildfires at JPL - Pasadena, California.jpg|933px|2009 California Wildfires at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA/JPL]] – Pasadena, California}}

Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oregon State University|title=About Oregon wildfire risk|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218072405/http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |title=The National Wildfire Mitigation Programs Database: State, County, and Local Efforts to Reduce Wildfire Risk |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907045339/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health. Global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|title=Extreme wildfires may be fueled by climate change|publisher=Michigan State University|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=1 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803213631/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|title=White House explains the link between Climate Change and Wild Fires|date=August 5, 2014|work=YouTube|author=Rajamanickam Antonimuthu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811074119/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airborne hazards===
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.

Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|year=2008|title=Wildfire smoke: A guide for public health officials|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071549/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildlife Coordination Group|year=2001|title=Smoke management guide for prescribed and wildland fire|location=Boise, ID|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011200515/http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt; Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.

The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) developed the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2009|title=Air quality index: A guide to air quality and health|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507130507/http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire risks===
After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into [[ash pit]]s.

=== At-Risk Groups ===

==== Firefighters====
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296–305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; [[Occupational injury|slips, trips, and falls]]; injuries from vehicle rollovers; [[Heat illness|heat-related illness]]; [[insect bites and stings]]; [[Occupational stress|stress]]; and [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy (2013–158)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154309/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013158|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Residents ====
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov" /&gt;

==== Fetal exposure ====
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes.  In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas.  This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=1&amp;SID=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&amp;page=2&amp;doc=16{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/15/emph.eov027.abstract?papetoc|title = Effects of wildfire disaster exposure on male birth weight in an Australian population.|last = O'Donnell|first = M H|date = November 15, 2015|journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health|doi = 10.1093/emph/eov027|pmid = 26574560|access-date = January 27, 2016|last2 = Behie|first2 = A M|volume = 2015|issue = 1|issn = 2050-6201|pages = 344–354|pmc = 4697771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia Coco|last2=Wilson|first2=Ander|last3=Mickley|first3=Loretta J.|last4=Dominici|first4=Francesca|last5=Ebisu|first5=Keita|last6=Wang|first6=Yun|last7=Sulprizio|first7=Melissa P.|last8=Peng|first8=Roger D.|last9=Yue|first9=Xu|date=January 2017|title=Wildfire-specific Fine Particulate Matter and Risk of Hospital Admissions in Urban and Rural Counties|journal=Epidemiology|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1097/ede.0000000000000556|issn=1044-3983|pmc=5130603|pmid=27648592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[water vapor]], [[particulate matter]], organic chemicals, [[Nitrogen oxide|nitrogen oxides]] and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |title=1 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110731/http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=June 2018|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In asthma patients, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2011.07.001 |title=Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Guide for the Nurse Practitioner |date=2012 |last1=Forsberg |first1=Nicole T. |last2=Longo |first2=Bernadette M. |last3=Baxter |first3=Kimberly |last4=Boutté |first4=Marie |journal=[[The Journal for Nurse Practitioners]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An observational study of smoke exposure related to the 2007 San Diego wildfires revealed an increase both in healthcare utilization and respiratory diagnoses, especially [[asthma]] among the group sampled.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Projected climate scenarios of wildfire occurrences predict significant increases in respiratory conditions among young children.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Particulates|Particulate Matter (PM)]] triggers a series of biological processes including inflammatory immune response, [[oxidative stress]], which are associated with harmful changes in allergic respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=2018-06-08|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034084/|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with [[asthma]] related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]], such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Colleen E.|last2=Brauer|first2=Michael|last3=Johnston|first3=Fay H.|last4=Jerrett|first4=Michael|last5=Balmes|first5=John R.|last6=Elliott|first6=Catherine T.|date=2016-04-15|title=Critical Review of Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke Exposure|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1334–43|doi=10.1289/ehp.1409277|issn=0091-6765|pmc=5010409|pmid=27082891}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More specifically, some people with [[asthma]] reported higher use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] (inhalers).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Carbon monoxide danger ===
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt;  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990–2006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include [[Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, and [[Phobia|phobias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21957753 |date=2011 |last1=Papanikolaou |first1=V |last2=Adamis |first2=D |last3=Mellon |first3=RC |last4=Prodromitis |first4=G |title=Psychological distress following wildfires disaster in a rural part of Greece: A case-control population-based study |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20411 |title=Locus of control and psychopathology in relation to levels of trauma and loss: Self-reports of Peloponnesian wildfire survivors |date=2009 |last1=Mellon |first1=Robert C. |last2=Papanikolau |first2=Vasiliki |last3=Prodromitis |first3=Gerasimos |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=189–96 |pmid=19452533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.4.509 |title=Psychiatric Disorders Among Adults Seeking Emergency Disaster Assistance After a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire |date=2007 |last1=Marshall |first1=G.

In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Wildfire: Radiation Raises Slight Concern As Blaze Hits Former Uranium, Gold Mines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Jessica|last=Leader|date=21 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021734/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
The western US has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM) Standards|date=April 24, 2016|publisher=EPA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125540/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.11.030 |title=Wildfire smoke and respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |date=2005 |last1=Sutherland |first1=E.

While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels.
