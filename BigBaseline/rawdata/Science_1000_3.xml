'''''A Briefer History of Time''''' is a [[parody science|science humor]] [[book]] by the American [[astronomer]] [[Eric Schulman]]. In this book, Schulman presents humorous summaries of what he claims are the fifty-three most important events since the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Volume 244, Issue 32 (August 10, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science News]]'', Volume 155, Number 22 (May 29, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mercury Magazine'', Volume 29, Number 2 (March/April 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
The title and cover are a [[parody]] of Stephen Hawking's book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Coincidentally, Hawking would later write a "sequel" entitled ''[[A Briefer History of Time (Hawking and Mlodinow book)|A Briefer History of Time]]''. Hawking's publisher [[Bantam Books]] was aware the title had already been used in a popular science book, but went ahead since "The other book was published six years ago, and Professor Hawking is an international figure."
&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Paul. Times Higher Education Supplement (May 27, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walden, Celia. [[The Daily Telegraph]] (May 31, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the author released the book under a [[creative commons license]], [[CC BY-NC-ND]] 1.0,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130085714/http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/bhtes/ A Briefer History of Time] "CC BY-ND-NC 1.0" (archived 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as free download on his website.

== Description ==
Laughing while learning is the intent of Schulman's book. The book shows why, even though the Universe is expanding, it doesn't get any easier to find a parking space. Furthermore, there is the pulp version of the origin of life (''"It was a dark and stormy night. In the shallow tide pool, a nucleic acid base collided with a sugar molecule.  An [[amino acid]] sank beneath the murky depths . . . ."'').

'''Bessa Vugo''' (3 September 1919 in [[Munich]] – 21 August 1991 in [[Kassel]] ) was a female German [[biologist]], who extensively contributed in the knowledge of the [[five senses]],&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/cerveau-conscience/numero-2-mai-jun-2015/page-66-67-texte-integral&lt;/ref&gt; through powerful experiments (shape of food, etc.). She is mostly popular in France, where she is often cited as an example of successful role of [[women in science]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lespritsorcier.org/blogs-membres/femmes-scientifiques-14-bessa-vugo/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

In 1941, Vugo became a medical doctor. In 1949, she joined the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of Cambridge University in England. She initially worked with [[Francis Crick]] on transcoding protein chains and aromatic [[adenosine triphosphate]]. She demonstrated the canine sense of "master returns". Her research underlay the research of French biologist [[Jacques Monod]].

Bessa Vugo is also famous for her illustration boards related to [[nutrition]] (French iconography scientific boards [[Deyrolle]], etc.). She was also interested in medical physics and conceived new tools to measure olfactory abilities.

== Research ==

Her experiments were carried out on chimpanzees and humans and expanded knowledge of the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lespritsorcier.org/blogs-membres/femmes-scientifiques-14-bessa-vugo/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular diffusion ===

She introduced a phenomenological law of molecular diffusion, which was known as the 'Law of Vugo'. It proposed an inverse relationship between the flux and the concentration gradient of a diluted chemical species. This law invalidated [[Fourier's Law]] for [[heat transfer]].

=== Food shape ===

Bessa offered experimental subjects food compacted into geometric forms (e.g. cubes, pyramids, croissant) measured the behavior of different species in response to different foods. Famously, small children accepted [[brussels sprouts]] shaped in the form of a crescent moon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The experiments supported Vugo's hypothesis that "smell precedes the direct mouthing information on odor or smell of food." Her work demonstrated the natural tendency of primates to use scent to assess an object they assume fragrant.

=== Taste ===

Bessa discovered the five types of taste buds in the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;in : Medisch Zaknoek op Reis (2014), 1.001 medische termen, vragen en uitleg van Nederlands in het Frans (https://books.google.fr/books?id=GwkIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT115&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;dq=taste+buds+vugo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UYJESqS_kf&amp;sig=g1aWiVq_Z2HMhA95OJiRujpVQww&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=taste%20buds%20vugo&amp;f=false)&lt;/ref&gt; She found 100 to 600 [[epithelial]] cells arranged in the shape of an [[onion peel]]; "sour", "spicy", "strong", "pleasant" and "unpleasant". She showed that the presence or absence of receptors do not alter the experience of the taster. Perceived taste is driven by retro nasal [[olfaction]]. The aromas released in the mouth by chewing diffuse to the nasal cavity and stimulate [[nerve cell]]s in the nose. Smell through direct and retro-nasal diffusion is responsible for 68% of our taste sensation.

=== Hearing ===

Bessa showed that in mammals, the ear size (e.g. [[fennec fox]]) is proportional to acuity of the 5 senses.

'''Biobus''' is a novel concept in [[science education]] involving a bus that has been equipped as a self-contained, [[mobile laboratory]] used to educate K-12 students in biology basics.&lt;ref name="Cardia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cardia|first1=Alexandra|title=Street Smarts: The BioBus Brings a Rolling Science Lab to Resource-Strapped Schools|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bio-bus-science-education/|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=6 February 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alec|title=The Magic School Bus Comes to Life|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/biobus-hopes-drive-students-science/|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[WNYC]]|date=5 November 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus may also be used for other audiences such as community organizations.

The first Biobus program was created in 1999 by [[Georgia State University]] (GSU), with grant assistance from the National Science Foundation. Since its founding, the GSU Biobus has made 950 visits involving over 80,000 people. The concept has spread beyond Georgia, including New York City.

'''Correactology''' is a system of [[alternative medicine]] based on the unsubstantiated claim that "regulating the density of cells" in the body improves a wide range of ailments. An offshoot of [[Chiropractic|chiropractics]], the treatment was developed in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury (Ontario)]] in 2002 by brothers Michael and Allan Lapointe.&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; It has been branded a [[pseudoscience]] by critics&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;&lt;ref name=kata/&gt; and the sole training program in the subject has been taken to court by former students.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

During correactology treatments, the practitioners hold their hands over patients, snap their fingers and apply a light touch to the skin of the patient. Allan Lapointe claims they are first looking for "areas of resistance in the eight segments of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], indicating areas of [[Pathology|pathological]] or [[Anatomy|anatomical]] dysfunction." The practitioner then allegedly uses his hands to change the behaviour of [[Protein|proteins]] present in human cells, to improve wellness and reduce pain: "We cause a cascading effect to change the behaviour of the proteins. When the proteins change, our behaviour changes because of course proteins control all."&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt;&lt;ref name=kata/&gt;

Medical professionals have been questioning the practice as it becomes more widespread. Deputy Editor of the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal|''Canadian Medical Association Journal'']] Matthew Stanbrook denounced the claims made by the practitioners: "That is [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-science]] that uses a scientific word that doesn't mean what density means. That makes absolutely no sense, to talk about the density of cells not being optimal. It makes even less sense to put forward the idea that through the manipulation involving touching, one could set the density of cells to an optimum level."&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; McGill University's [[Office for Science and Society]] also identifies correactology as a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

While they have no formal medical training, the Lapointes say they are working on research showing their techniques are more effective than placebos.&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;

Practitioners are present in a dozen clinics throughout Ontario, as well as one in [[Gatineau|Gatineau (Quebec)]]. Correactology is a term trademarked by a corporation owned by the Lapointe brothers and run by their parents. The treatment is not recognized by either the Ontario College of Chiropractors or the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario|Ontario College of Physicians]]. The Quebec College of Physicians is investigating the techniques and claims related to correactology.&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt;

==Collège Boréal programme and court case==

In 2016, the [[Collège Boréal]] signed a four-year agreement by which Sudbury's Correactology Health Care Center would offer a training programme for the College's students, at a cost of $50,000 per student. Boréal cancelled the agreement after two years,&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; as three former students took the correactology center to court on charges of false statements, conspiracy, impediment to trade and breach of contract.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

The court proceedings showed the students had to commit to giving 30 percent of their future earnings to the correactology center. An attempt to have the court case dismissed by invoking the confidentiality clause of the training contract was rebuffed by the court in July, 2018. The court proceedings continue.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

[[File:Stieler,_Joseph_Karl_-_Alexander_von_Humboldt_-_1843.jpg|thumb|''Humboldt and his Kosmos'' (1843), [[Joseph Karl Stieler]]]]
'''''Cosmos''''' (in German ''Kosmos – Entwurf einer physischen Weltbeschreibung'') is an influential [[treatise]] on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. ''Cosmos'' began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the [[University of Berlin]], and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and completed based on Humboldt's notes). In the first volume of ''Cosmos'', Humboldt paints a general “portrait of nature”, describing the physical nature of outer space and the earth. In the second volume he describes the [[history of science]].&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] view of the orderliness of the [[cosmos]] (the [[harmony]] of the [[universe]]) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. Humboldt goes on to suggest that when one contemplates the beauty of the cosmos, one can obtain personal inspiration and a beneficial, if subjective, awareness about life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=L. D.|title=Introducing Humboldt’s Cosmos|journal=Minding Nature|volume=August|year=2009|pages=3–15|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cosmos'' was influenced by Humboldt’s various travels and studies, but mainly by his journey throughout the Americas. As he wrote, “it was the discovery of America that planted the seed of the Cosmos.”&lt;ref name="Walls"&gt;Laura Dassow Walls, ''The Passage to Cosmos: Alexander von Humboldt and the Shaping of America'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to all of his experience in the field, Humboldt was preeminently qualified for the task to represent the universe in a single work.&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;Robert B. Downs, ''Landmarks in Science: Hippocrates to Carson'' (Littleton, Colo: Libraries Unlimited, 1982), 189-191.&lt;/ref&gt; He had extensive knowledge of many fields of learning, varied experiences as a traveler, and the resources of the scientific and literary world at his disposal.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' was highly popular when it was released, with the first volume selling out in two months, and the work translated into most European languages.&lt;ref name="Botting"&gt;Douglas Botting, ''Humboldt and the Cosmos'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973), 258-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the  [[natural science]]s have diverged from the romantic perspective Humboldt presented in  ''Cosmos'', the work is still considered to be a substantial scientific and literary achievement, having influenced subsequent scientific progress and imparted a unifying perspective to the studies of science, nature, and mankind.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

==Background and influences==

Since the early years of the nineteenth century, Humboldt had been a world-famous figure, second in renown only to Napoleon. As the son of an aristocratic family in Prussia, he received the best education available at the time in Europe, studying under famous thinkers at the universities of Frankfurt and Göttingen. By the time he wrote ''Cosmos'', Humboldt was an esteemed explorer, cosmographer, biologist, diplomat, engineer, and citizen of the world.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; While considered a geographer, he is accredited with contributing to most of the sciences of the natural world environment found today.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Jeff Lee, ''Alexander von Humboldt'' (New York: American Geographical Society, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A portrait of Humboldt by Friedrich Georg Weitsch, 1806]]

===Humboldt in the Americas===

Probably more than any other factor, Humboldt's career was shaped by his travels in South and Central America in the five years from 1799 to 1804.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Humboldt said that his Cosmos was born on the slopes of the Andes.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Beginning in Venezuela, he explored the Orinoco and upper Amazon valleys, climbed Mount Chimborazo — then believed to be the world's highest mountain — investigated changing vegetation from the tropical jungles to the top of the Andes, collected thousands of plant specimens, and accumulated a vast collection of animals, insects, and geological fragments.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; From the notes he gathered on this journey, Humboldt was able to produce at least thirty volumes based on his observations.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; His studies related to many scientific fields, including botany, zoology, geology, and geography, as well as narratives of popular travel and discussions of political, economic, and social conditions.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

===Humboldt in Asia===

Twenty-five years after his exploration of the Americas, at the age of sixty, Humboldt undertook an extended tour, subsidized by the Tsar of Russia, into the interior of Asia.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Between May and November 1829, Humboldt and his two subordinates, C.G. Ehrenberg and Gustav Rose, traveled across the vast expanse of the Russian empire. Upon his return, Humboldt left the publication of the scientific results to Ehrenberg and Rose, while his own work — a three-volume descriptive geography entitles ''Asie Centrale'' — did not appear until many years later. This work was very modest in comparison to Humboldt's South American publications. ''Asie Centrale'' focused on the facts and figures of Central Asian geography, along with data to complete his isothermal world map.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; It was during his South American and Asian explorations that Humboldt made the observations crucial to forming his physical description of the universe in ''Cosmos''.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

===Berlin lectures===

In 1827, having spent himself into poverty publishing his scientific works, his king, Friedrich Wilhelm III, reminded Humboldt of his debt and recalled him to Berlin. When he arrived in Berlin, Humboldt announced that he would give a course of lectures on physical geography. From November 1827 to April 1828, he delivered a series of sixty-one lectures at the University of Berlin. The lectures were so well-attended, that Humboldt soon announced a second series, which was held in a music hall before an audience of thousands, free to all comers.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Beginning in 1828, Humboldt finally gave expression to his concept in his Berlin lectures, and from then on he labored to produce his physical description of the universe in book form.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; Collaborators pledged to his assistance included the greatest scientists of his generation, including leaders in chemistry, astronomy, anatomy, mathematics, mineralogy, botany, and other areas of study.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

==Publication==

In 1828 after the Berlin lectures, Humboldt began formulating his vision in writing. His factual text, heavily loaded with footnotes and references, was sent in proof sheets to all the various specialists for comments and corrections before publication. In this way, he aimed to ensure that what he wrote was both accurate and up-to-date. He continually looked to his friend and literary advisor Varnhagen von Ense for advice in the matter of his style of writing.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; In total ''Cosmos'' took twenty-five years to write.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

[[File:Cosmos kaulbach 215.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A portrait of Humboldt greeting death, by Wilhelm von Kaulbach, 1869]] Humboldt felt as if publishing ''Cosmos'' was a race against death. The first volume was published in 1845 when he was seventy-six, the second when he was seventy-eight, the third when he was eighty-one, and the fourth when he was eighty-nine. The fifth volume, however, was only half-written when Humboldt died in 1859 and had to be completed from his notes and provided with an index over a thousand pages long.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

==Content==

Humboldt viewed the world as what the ancient Greeks called a kosmos – “a beautifully ordered and harmonious system” – and coined the modern word “cosmos” to use as the title of his final work.&lt;ref name="Aaron"&gt;Aaron Sachs, "The Humboldt Current: Nineteenth-Century Exploration and the Roots of American Environmentalism." (New York: Viking, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This title allowed him to encompass heaven and earth together.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; He reintroduced Cosmos as “the assemblage of all things in heaven and earth, the universality of created things constituting the perceptible world.”&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Cosmos'' (George Bell, 1883) 1:24.&lt;/ref&gt; His basic purpose is outlined in the introduction to the first volume:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The most important aim of all physical science is this: to recognize unity in diversity, to comprehend all the single aspects as revealed by the discoveries of the last epochs, to judge single phenomena separately without surrendering their bulk, and to grasp Nature's essence under the cover of outer appearances."&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Humboldt soon adds that Cosmos signifies both the “order of the world, and adornment of this universal order.”&lt;ref name="Cosmos"/&gt; Thus, there are two aspects of the Cosmos, the “order” and the “adornment.” The first refers to the observed fact that the physical universe, independently of humans, demonstrates regularities and patterns that we can define as laws.  Adornment, however, is up to human interpretation. To Humboldt, Cosmos is both ordered and beautiful, through the human mind.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; He created a dynamic picture of the universe that would continually grow and change as human conceptions of nature and the depth of human feeling about nature enlarge and deepen.

To represent this double-sided aspect of Cosmos, Humboldt divided his book into two parts, with the first painting a general “portrait of nature.”&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Humboldt first examines outer space – the Milky Way, cosmic nebulae, and planets – and then proceeds to the earth and its physical geography; climate; volcanoes; relationships among plants, animals, and mankind; evolution; and the beauty of nature. In the second part, on the history of science, Humboldt aims to take the reader on an inner or “subjective” journey through the mind.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;  Humboldt is concerned with “the difference of feeling excited by the contemplation of nature at different epochs,” that is, the attitudes toward natural phenomena among poets, painters, and students of nature through the ages.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; The final three volumes are devoted to a more detailed account of scientific studies in astronomy, the earth’s physical properties, and geological formations.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; On the whole, the final work followed the scheme of the Berlin lectures reasonably faithfully.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

In the book Humboldt provided observations supporting the [[elevation crater|elevation crater theory]] of his friend [[Leopold von Buch]]. The theory in question intended to explain the [[mountain formation|origin of mountains]] and retained some popularity among geologists into the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Şengör |first=Celâl|author-link=Celâl Şengör |date=1982|chapter=Classical theories of orogenesis|editor-last=Miyashiro|editor-first=Akiho|editor-link=Akiho Miyashiro|editor-last2=Aki|editor-first2=Keiiti|editor-last3=Şengör|editor-first3=Celâl |title=Orogeny |url= |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=4–6 |isbn=0-471-103764|ref=Sengor1982}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to ''Cosmos''==

===Reception===

''Cosmos'' was considered to be both a scientific and literary achievement, immensely popular among nineteenth-century readers.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Although the book bore the daunting subtitle of ''A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe'', and had an index that ran to more than 1,000 pages, the first volume sold out in two months, the work was translated into all major languages and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;Sachs, A. (1995, 03). Humboldt's legacy and the restoration of science. World Watch, 8, 28. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/230005809&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's publisher claimed: "The demand is epoch-making. Book parcels destined for London and St. Petersburg were torn out of our hands by agents who wanted their orders filled for the bookstores in Vienna and Hamburg." &lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' largely enhanced Humboldt's reputation in his own lifetime, not only in his own country but throughout Europe and America as well. Its enthusiastic reception in England, where it came out in the Bohn Scientific Library in a translation by Elizabeth Leeves, particularly surprised him. The reviews were gushing in praise of both the author and his work.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

However, some felt he had not done justice to the contribution of modern British scientists and many were quick to point out that Humboldt, who had written so exhaustively about the creation of the universe, failed to ever mention God the Creator.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;

===Legacy===

[[File:Humboldt Alexander, vor Uni Berlin.jpg|thumb|115px|left|Humboldt statue at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].]]
Humboldt's ''Cosmos'' had a significant impact on scientific progress, as well as various scientists and authors throughout Europe and America.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt; Humboldt's work gave a strong impetus to scientific exploration throughout the nineteenth century, inspiring many, including Charles Darwin, who brought some of Humboldt's earlier writings with him on his voyage as the naturalist aboard the ''Beagle'' in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Darwin called Humboldt "the greatest scientific traveler who ever lived."&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

''Cosmos'' influenced several American authors, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Emerson read Humboldt's work throughout his life, and for him, ''Cosmos'' capped Humboldt's role as a scientific revolutionary.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Edgar Allan Poe was also an admirer of Humboldt, even dedicating his last major work, ''Eureka: A Prose Poem'', to Humboldt.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences was a major inspiration for Poe's work.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt; Walt Whitman was said to have kept a copy of ''Cosmos'' on his desk for inspiration as he wrote ''Leaves of Grass'', and Henry David Thoreau's ''Walden'', like ''Eureka'', was a response to Humboldt's ideas.&lt;ref name="Walls"/&gt;

Although ''Cosmos'' and Humboldt's work in general had such a lasting impact on scientific thought, interest in Humboldt's life, work, and ideas over the past two centuries has dwindled in comparison to what it once was.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"&gt;Kent Mathewson, ''Humboldt's Twenty-First-Century Currency: Recent Upwellings, Commemorations, and Critical Commentaries" (New York: American Geographical Society, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting in the 1990s and continuing to date, an upswing in scholarly interest in Humboldt has occurred.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt; A new edition of ''Cosmos'' released in Germany in 2004 received avid reviews, renewing Humboldt's prominence in German society.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt; German media outlets hailed the largely forgotten Humboldt as a new avatar figure for German national renewal and a model cosmopolitan ambassador of German culture and civilization for the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Mathewson"/&gt;

Humboldt is also credited with laying the foundations of physical geography, meteorology, and especially [[biogeography]]. His account in ''Cosmos'' of the propagation of seismic waves also became the basis of modern seismology.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; His most enduring contribution to scientific progress, however, in his conception of the unity of science, nature, and mankind.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; ''Cosmos'' showed nature as a whole, not as unconnected parts.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

He is best known for making numerous predictions, which have passed, regarding the end times, including that a hidden planet named [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]] (sometimes known as Planet&amp;nbsp;X) would destroy the [[Earth]].

Meade predicted that planet Nibiru would collide with Earth on September 23, 2017, destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Karangu|first1=Jessie|title=The world is ending on September 23, according to a biblical prophecy|url=http://wjla.com/news/offbeat/the-world-is-ending-on-september-23-according-to-a-biblical-prophecy|website=[[WJLA-TV]]|publisher=[[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his prediction failed, he revised the apocalypse to October, where he stated that the seven-year [[Great Tribulation|tribulation]] would possibly start followed by a [[Millennialism|millennium]] of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Gajanan|first1=Mahita|title=David Meade Said the World Was Going to End Last Weekend.

Meade is best known for using [[Bible]] passages and Bible verses regarding his predictions. His September 23 prediction was based on secret codes in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]] in [[Egypt]] and revolved around the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]. He used the number [[33 (number)|33]] for his September 23 prediction, stating that “[[Jesus]] lived for 33 years” and that “[[Elohim#Canaanite religion|Elohim]] is mentioned 33 times in the Bible.” His October 2017 predictions were described on his website Planet X News and his book ''Will Planet&amp;nbsp;X Signal the Rapture?''.

=== October 2017 predictions ===
As September 23 passed, however, Meade again revised the apocalypse to October, making new predictions for that month, such as Nibiru eclipsing the sun on October 5 and that several people would [[levitate]] into the sky (including current [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]]) followed by a nuclear attack by [[North Korea]], [[China]], and [[Russia]] on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meade|first1=David|title=Will Planet X Signal the Rapture?|url=https://www.ebookit.com/tools/pd/Bo/eBookIt/booktitle-Will-Planet-X-Signal-the-Rapture|quote=Meade, David: I know the day but I'd rather not mention it at this point, but it is in October and in the very latter part) that Russia, China and North Korea would use a combination of drone submarines and unmarked container ships to engage in a nuclear attack on the US coast.|publisher=Self-published|website=ebookit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetXNews/&gt; He predicted other events for that month, such as a series of magnitude 9.8 earthquakes; that the Earth's pole would shift by 30 degrees; that the United States would be split in half; and that [[Barack Obama]] would be elected as U.S. President for an [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|illegal]] third term.&lt;ref name=PlanetXNews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meade|first1=David|title=October 2017 and the 'End of Days'|url=http://planetxnews.com/2017/08/30/october-2017-end-days/|quote=Meade, David: Over one billion people will disappear.

=== Predictions for 2018 ===
In an interview with [[YouTube]] pastor Paul Begley, Meade made several predictions for 2018, such as North Korea becoming a world-class superpower in March 2018 and predicting that Nibiru would destroy the Earth in spring.&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jha |first=Nupur |title=Nibiru will hit Earth and cause doomsday in 2018, predicts David Meade|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/nibiru-will-hit-earth-cause-doomsday-2018-predicts-david-meade-760172|website=International Business Times|quote=Meade, David:”Here's what I believe is going to start in the Spring of 2018: I believe North Korea will ascend to become a world-class superpower in March of 2018.

Meade has faced criticism from fellow Christians: [[Ed Stetzer]], writing for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', stated that "there is no such thing as a 'Christian numerologist{{' "}},&lt;ref name=Stetzer/&gt; and described Meade as "a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event."&lt;ref name=Stetzer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stetzer|first1=Ed|title=No, the World Won't End Next Week and There's No Such Thing as a Christian Numerologist|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2017/september/end-times-fake-news.html|periodical=[[Christianity Today]]|date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher M.

[[Albert Mohler]], the President of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] stated, upon Meade's previous prediction in September 2017, that "Christians are not called to be the setters of dates and the anticipation of the calendar."

Meade told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that his September 23, 2017 prediction was based on numerical codes in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Bucher"/&gt; He also based his predictions on what he says are coded messages in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sudakov|first1=Dmitry|title=Date for planet Nibiru to crash into Earth encrypted in Pyramid of Giza|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/science/mysteries/18-08-2017/138453-planet_nibiru-0/|website=[[Pravda.ru]]|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific focus of his prediction revolved around the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] (referring to [[Revelation 12 sign prophecy|Revelation 12]]), another event that was supposed to take place on September 23 when a certain configuration of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] would happen.&lt;ref name=graney/&gt; He stated the significant number for his September 23 prediction is the number [[33 (number)|33]], on the grounds that "Jesus lived for 33 years" and "Elohim, the Canaanite god who was later adopted as the supreme god of ancient Israel, is mentioned 33 times in the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Matthew |title=Conspiracy nuts claim an invisible rogue planet is going to bring about the Rapture|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/18/this-saturday-an-invisible-rogue-planet-will-bring-about-the-rapture-maybe/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|quote=Meade, David: understanding all of this is the number 33.

Meade's April 23 prediction was based on passage 12:1-2 in the [[Book of Revelation]], which states "And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth".&lt;ref name=Nzherald/&gt; He referred to the woman as Virgo and stated that the alignment represents "the Lion of the tribe of Judah".&lt;ref name=Nzherald/&gt; When discussing the 7-year tribulation and [[rapture]], he stated “The Book of Revelation states that men will approach [[Armageddon]] on horseback.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10021">This article contains list of '''discrete dipole approximation codes''' and their applications.

The [[discrete dipole approximation]] (DDA) is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary geometry. Given a target of arbitrary geometry, one seeks to calculate its scattering and absorption properties. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire dipole moments in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled dipole approximation. It is closely related to method of moments, digitized Green's function, or volume integral equation method.

'''''Earth &amp; Sky''''', also known as '''''EarthSky''''' (the still-active website), was a daily radio series that presented information about [[science]] and [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.EarthSky.org EarthSky.]'' [http://earthsky.org/earthsky-a-clear-voice-for-science Earthsky: A clear voice for science] Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It began broadcasting in 1991. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was the creation of producers [[Deborah Byrd]] and Joel Block, who were also the hosts.  They previously hosted the program [[StarDate (radio program)|Star Date]] that began broadcasting in the US in 1977.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' presented 60- and 90-second radio spots (called "modules") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial [[radio]] as well as [[satellite radio]] and [[internet radio]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.Podfeed.net Podfeed.net].''  http://www.podfeed.net/podcast/Earth++Sky+radio+show/2730  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and other [[public radio]] stations, 80 affiliate stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EarthSky.org ''EarthSky''.] http://earthsky.org/partners/offerings  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, the programming iwas heard on American Forces Radio, [[Voice of America]] Radio, [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]], and others.

The information on ''Earth &amp; Sky'' came directly from scientists. The [[journalist]]s who produced the ''Earth &amp; Sky'' radio program and continue to produce the Website speak to several scientists each day, dozens each week and hundreds each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 scientists had joined ''Earth &amp; Sky'' as volunteer advisers. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' science advisers suggested content, gave feedback, recommended other experts, and reviewed scripts for accuracy before they were recorded for broadcast.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' featured many fields of science. In 2006, it focused was on [[nanotechnology]], [[women in science]], [[List of Earth observation satellites|observing the Earth]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Space science|space]], and the human world.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode of ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was broadcast on June 2, 2013. President and co-founder Deborah Byrd said that although funding options existed to continue the radio program, a decision was made to stop producing the radio show in order to concentrate on the Website and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Brandon|title=Silent Nignt: EarthSky says goodbye to radio|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2013-03-04/silent-night/|accessdate=16 July 2014|work=The Austin Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Sueño de Arquímedes''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast by [[Radio Nacional de España|Radio Nacional de España (RNE)]] from September 2006 until June, 2007. The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 35 programs are still available for download. In addition to El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano also hosted [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]], which was broadcast weekly without interruption from April 1995 until June 2007. The name of the program means "the dream of [[Archimedes]]", and alludes to Archimedes' statement that given a [[lever]] and a fixed point, he could move the world. To Ángel Rodríguez Lozano, the dream was moving the world by popularizing and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano.] First published 30 June 2007.''"Arquímedes, lo que propuso fue que con una palanca podía mover el mundo. Para mi, El sueño de Arquímedes era simplemente mover el mundo divulgando y repartiendo conocimiento."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Before the startup of El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano had been hosting Vanguardia de la Ciencia for more than a decade. When RNE
asked if he would host a second popular science program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano realised that the scheduled timing, Sundays between 3 and 4 p.m, meant that it would be sandwiched between sports broadcasts. Therefore, he would have to capture the attention of listeners who were not looking for this type of program. The intention was therefore to make the program even more accessible than Vanguardia de la Ciencia, with shorter interviews and more music. Ángel Rodríguez Lozano stated that it had been a marvellous experience, and that the response had been tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ |title=¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano |publisher=Dimetu.com |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included science news, interviews, and biographies of great scientists, written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo]. In the final, humorous section of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano paid a visit to the archetypical [[mad scientist]]
[http://www.ciencia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d5391d7ca78deb60dc51e84fc79f34cf020766f1ed143c396b5d1b644b9b60d9d0e1aa0b6615df94332359e92d8b381cbb51cf1d8bab454cc Alejandro Laguna], who supposedly lived and worked in a hidden laboratory in the basements of Radio Nacional de España, seven floors below ground level. Alejandro would demonstrate one of his latest inventions, which usually defied the laws of physics, and Ángel played the role of a rather gullible spectator. Alejandro then explained the physics of the corresponding real-world device. Finally, the demonstration of his invention usually had some highly unpleasant consequence for Ángel.

==Termination of El Sueño de Arquímedes==

In June 2007, El Sueño de Arquímedes and Vanguardia de la Ciencia were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs of Vangurardia de la Ciencia, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Correspondence section at the end of the program [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]] of 9 June 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the previously referenced interview, he explained that everyone older than 52 years had to retire early, and that he was 54 years old at the time.

The decision to terminate the programs was widely criticized in Spanish-speaking blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angel |url=http://golemp.blogspot.com/2007/06/una-oscuridad-que-crece.html |title=GOLEM Blog: Una oscuridad que crece |publisher=Golemp.blogspot.com |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napalfoto.blogspot.com/2007/06/vanguardia-de-la-ciencia-se-despide.html |title=Napalius: Vanguardia de la ciencia se despide |publisher=Napalfoto.blogspot.com |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sqysublog.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-fin-de-un-hermoso-sueo.html Bienvenido a mi mundo...: El fin de un hermoso sueño] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620002521/http://sqysublog.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-fin-de-un-hermoso-sueo.html |date=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lacasito |url=http://oncoloxiamolecular.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-sueo-de-arqumedes.html |title=Grupo de Oncoloxía Molecular: El sueño de Arquímedes |publisher=Oncoloxiamolecular.blogspot.com |date=28 February 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rvr.blogalia.com/historias/50510 |title=Cuaderno de bitácora – Menos ciencia en RNE |publisher=Rvr.blogalia.com |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francisco José Martinez |url=http://lectorblogs.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-sueo-de-arqu-y-vanguardia-de-la.html |title=Diario de un lector de blogs: El sueño de Arquímides y Vanguardia de la Ciencia |publisher=Lectorblogs.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/podcast-es/browse_thread/thread/e7ec10776dd535b5/7befce50149e9778?lnk=raot |title=Fin de un podcast – podcast-es &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Google  |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Escrito por Josemi |url=http://www.zentolos.com/?p=331 |title=Blog Archive » Reestructuración de empresa |publisher=Zentolos |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicado por --3nder |url=http://binarybots.blogspot.com/2007/07/dime-que-es-un-sueo.html |title=BinaryBots: Dime que es un sueño |publisher=Binarybots.blogspot.com |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Josephine Macdonald''' (4 March 1906 – 26 July 2007) was a pioneer American [[cancer]] [[epidemiologist]] and [[cancer researcher]] influenced and [[mentor]]ed by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] and [[Shields Warren]]. One of the earliest proponents of the idea that cancer was a preventable [[disease]]. She established the first [[cancer registry]] in the United States in Connecticut.

==Life and times==
Eleanor Josephine Macdonald the daughter of Angus Alexander and Catherine Macdonald was born in the [[Boston]] suburb of West [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], in 1906. She died in [[Houston, Texas]], in 2007. Angus Alexander, whose family had come from [[Scotland]], was an [[engineer]] at [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company|A.T. &amp; T.]] and Catharine Boland Macdonald, whose family were of [[Anglo-Irish]] descent was a [[concert pianist]]. She attended [[Radcliffe College]] and graduated in 1928 with [[A.B.]] degrees in [[music]], [[history of literature]], and [[English studies|English]]. For 4 years following graduation, she performed as a professional [[cellist]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Reports of the President and Treasurer. (1929). Radcliffe College. Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, Rosanna. (28 July 2007). Eleanor J. Macdonald. Houston Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology career==
Robert B. Greenough, [[M.D.]], chairman of the Cancer Committee in Massachusetts, and friend of the family asked Macdonald for assistance in writing a research paper on [[Fibrocystic breast changes|cystic mastitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenough, Robert B. (1905). On the Nature of the Cell Inclusions of Cancer. The Journal of medical research. 13(2): 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenough, Robert B. (1925). "Varying Degrees of Malignancy in Cancer of the Breast." The Journal of Cancer Research 9(4): 453-463.&lt;/ref&gt; This led her to become an [[epidemiologist]]. Macdonald studied the fundamentals of [[epidemiology]] and [[statistics]] at [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard University School of Public Health]]. At Harvard she worked with [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] who tutored her in statistical approaches and the [[Ronald Fisher]] [[Statistical Methods for Research Workers|methods]]. Macdonald was then appointed as the [[Epidemiologist]] in Boston's State Cancer Program at the Division of Adult Hygiene for director Dr. Herbert L. Lombard.&lt;ref&gt;Lombard, Herbert L., and Eleanor Josephine Macdonald. (1931). "State-Aided Cancer Clinics as Seen by the Practicing Physician." New England Journal of Medicine. 205(20): 949-951.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (2011). Making Cancer History. Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; She was an early adopter of the new computer technology that became available to researchers.  Since about 1930 Macdonald worked with [[Remington Rand]] punch cards.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, Eleanor J. (February 1936). "Fundamentals of Epidemiology." The Radcliffe Quarterly. February 1936: 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marchiafava, Louis J. (19 May 2000). Eleanor Macdonald. Making Cancer History, Voices Oral History Project. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Oral History Project. Houston, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1940-1948 she worked for the Connecticut State Department of Health as [[statistician]]. Then to [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Hospital]] in New York. Macdonald was asked by Dr. [[Thomas Parran, Jr.]], [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] to set up a national cancer registry as she had done in Connecticut. In 1948 her work in Connecticut led to publishing the seminal work "The Incidence and Survival in Cancer".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, E. J. (1948). The present incidence and survival picture in cancer and the promise of improved prognosis. Bulletin of American College of Surgeons.&lt;/ref&gt; After this she went on to [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center|M.D. Anderson Hospital]] in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, Rosanna. (28 July 2007). Eleanor J. Macdonald. Houston Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work in New England caught the attention of Dr. R. Lee Clark who recruited her to be the head of the newly created Department of [[Epidemiology]] at the University of Texas [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center|M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, C. Stratton. (20 February 2012). Remembering MD Anderson Presidents and Dr. Eleanor Macdonald. Oral History Interview. Historical Resources Center, Research Medical Library, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 she went to Houston to become [[Professor]] of [[Epidemiology]] at MD Anderson. 
During her tenure she developed a 200-code (referred to as the anticipatory code) method for transcribing patient charts that provided statistical information to M. D. Anderson's physicians and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Jr, R., &amp; Macdonald, E. J. (1949). The University of Texas, MD Anderson Hospital for Cancer Research.

'''Fieldnotes''' refer to [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] notes recorded by [[scientist]]s or researchers in the course of [[field research]], during or after their [[observation]] of a specific [[phenomenon]] they are studying. The notes are intended to be read as evidence that gives meaning and aids in the understanding of the phenomenon. Fieldnotes allow the researcher to access the subject and record what they observe in an unobtrusive manner.

One major disadvantage of taking fieldnotes is that they are recorded by an observer and are thus subject to (a) memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Pres|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (b) possibly, the conscious or unconscious [[Confirmation bias|bias]] of the observer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is best to record fieldnotes immediately after leaving the site to avoid forgetting important details.

Fieldnotes are particularly valued in descriptive sciences such as [[ethnography]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[archaeology]], each of which have long traditions in this area.

== Structure ==
There are two components of fieldnotes: descriptive information and reflective information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/fieldnotes|title=Research Guides: Organizing Your Social Sciences Research Paper: Writing Field Notes|last=Labaree|first=Robert V.|website=libguides.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptive information is factual data that is being recorded. Factual data includes time and date, the state of the physical setting, social environment, descriptions of the subjects being studied and their roles in the setting, and the impact that the observer may have had on the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reflective information is the observer's reflections about the observation being conducted. These reflections are ideas, questions, concerns, and other related thoughts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fieldnotes can also include sketches, diagrams, and other drawings. Visually capturing a phenomenon requires the observer to pay more attention to every detail as to not overlook anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MMR vaccine and autism ==
In 1998 [[Andrew Wakefield]] published a fraudulent article in a ''The Lancet'', a prominent British medical journal, claiming that the MMR [[vaccines caused autism]].&lt;ref name="3."/&gt; Although the article was later retracted, the idea that vaccines cause autism became a major news story.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008&gt;{{cite news |title= The MMR hoax |author= Goldacre B |work=The Guardian |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/30/mmr.health.media|archiveurl=http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/|archivedate=30 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that scientists had shown the narrative to be false, it had become part of the folk epidemiology of autism.&lt;ref name="1."/&gt;&lt;ref name="3."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=B.|title=Vaccines and the changing epidemiology of autism|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=32|issue=5|year=2006|pages=511–519|issn=0305-1862|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00655.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative was easy to understand and apparently consistent with anecdotal evidence of children receiving autism diagnoses shortly after having been vaccinated. Doctors were highly critical of the media coverage for triggering a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5118166.stm|title= Doctors issue plea over MMR jab|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-04 | date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The false belief has persisted despite a public information campaign aimed at making parents aware that by refusing vaccinations they are putting their children at risk of contracting infectious diseases that are frequently fatal.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt;

===Mass media===
Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy alleging that the media provided Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsements by [[celebrity|celebrities]] such as [[Jenny McCarthy]] and [[Robert F.

[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1]&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentary faulted the coverage for giving a misleading impression of the degree to which the evidence supported a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K | year = 2007 | title = Parents' champions vs. vested interests: Who do parents believe about MMR?

===Consequences===
The scientific consensus is that the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt; The false belief that the [[MMR vaccine]] causes autism led to a sharp drop in rates of vaccination in the UK and Ireland after 1998, creating a major public health risk. Lower vaccination rates were followed by increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, and the resulting cases of permanent disability and death.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;

Public fears about vaccination have consumed resources that might otherwise have advanced research into the real causes of autism.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; There have been thirteen studies that properly followed the [[scientific method]] and contained large numbers of participants that failed to connect autism to the [[MMR vaccine]].&lt;ref name="4."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerber|first1=Jeffrey S.|last2=Offit|first2=Paul A.|title=Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=48|issue=4|year=2009|pages=456–461|issn=1058-4838|doi=10.1086/596476|pmc=2908388}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been seven well-constructed studies that have attempted to link autism to [[thiomersal]] in vaccines and were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt; Special interest groups continue to push for more research on the link between vaccines and autism.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt;&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; Further research motivated by the folk epidemiology of autism would represent a lost opportunity to investigate autism's true causes.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6167">A '''government scientist''' is a [[scientist]] [[employment|employed]] by a country's [[government]], either in a research-driven job (for example [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan Project]]), or for another role that requires scientific training and methods. In some countries other terms such Technical officers is also used for scientists.

==Australia==

In Australia, most government scientists are employed by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]. A Chief Scientist is appointed to advise the government through the [[Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia)|Office of the Chief Scientist]].

==Singapore==
In [[Singapore]], government scientists are classified according to the Departmental Titles (Alteration) (Amendment) Act 1996, which amended the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance of 1950.
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], government scientists are part of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]]. However, that was not always the case. Before the Second World War, government scientists were recruited and employed by the Civil Service on an ad hoc basis, with grades, job titles, and organizations that varied between departments. In 1930, the Carpenter Committee was appointed to investigate the organization of civil service scientific and technical staff, and its report proposed a reorganization that covered the entire Service. This report was endorsed by the Tomlin Commission, however it was impossible to reach agreement with the relevant staff associations, who wanted other professional groups within the civil service to be similarly reorganized, and nothing ended up happening.&lt;ref name=Gladden&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Services of the United Kingdom|author=E. N. Gladden|pages=35–37|year=1967|publisher=Frank Cass and Company Ltd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War Two changed this by causing a far greater number of scientific and technical staff to be employed by the government. The Barlow Committee on Scientific Staff in Government Departments reviewed the positions of government scientists during wartime, issuing a report on 1943-04-23. This report spurred the creation of a government [[white paper]], entitled ''The Scientific Civil Service'', which resulted in a reorganization of government scientisgts across the entire Service. This reorganization classified governmenvnt scientists across the entire Service into three major classes similar to those civil servants for the Treasury had already been classified in:&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Scientific Officer class:Grades of scientific officer began with Scientific Officer, and progressed through Senior, Principal, Senior Principal, Deputy Chief, and Chief Scientific Officers.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Experimental Officer class:Grades of experimental officer began with Assistant Experimental Officer, and progressed through Experimental Officer to Senior and then Chief Experimental Officers. Experimental officers were either university graduates or people who had qualifications such as the [[Higher National Certificate]], and were support staff for Scientific Officers.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Scientific Assistant class:This class of civil servant undertook the routine work, and was largely equivalent to the Treasury's Clerical Class.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the employment of scientists by state and federal governments was, like in the U.K., affected by the Second World War. President Roosevelt first created the [[National Defense Research Committee]] under [[Vannevar Bush]]. This was then expanded to the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], also led by Bush. The OSRD employed scientists on a contract basis, with the OSRD as client and individual scientists as contractors. Scientists were contracted to research (through study and experiment) a specified subject, without constraints as to method, and to issue reports to the OSRD.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance&gt;{{cite book|title=An Uneasy Alliance|author=J. Chandra and Stephen M. Robinson|pages=6–7|publisher=SIAM|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-535-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, scientific research was continued by agencies such as the [[Office of Naval Research]] established in 1947, which again employed scientists as contractors. Scientific research was published in the normal way. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], established in 1946, and the [[National Institutes of Health]], established in 1930, also paid scientists for scientific research, and were major sources of government research funding.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance /&gt;

The [[National Science Foundation]] was eventually established in 1950. Defence research was explicitly excluded from its charter, even though Dr Bush had originally envisioned the NSF as including that as well. The armed forces established their own research departments, such as the [[Office of Ordnance Research]] for the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], established on the campus of [[Duke University]] in June 1951.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance /&gt;

U.S. local, state, and federal governments also employ scientists directly. The federal government employs them in departments such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], and the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]]. States and cities employ scientists in similar roles, including at fish and game commissions, parks, [[aquarium]]s, [[arboretum]]s, and [[museum]]s; and at agencies such as environmental inspection agencies, crime laboratories, and public health monitoring agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Opportunities in Biological Science Careers|author=Kathleen Belikoff and Charles A. Winter|pages=39–40|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2004|isbn=978-0-07-143187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron stress repressed RNA''' (IsrR) is a cis-encoded [[antisense]] RNA which regulates the expression of the photosynthetic protein isiA. IsiA expression is activated by the [[Ferric uptake regulator family|Ferric uptake regulator protein]] (Fur) under [[iron]] stress conditions.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16636284 |pmc=1459017 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600927103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsrR is abundant when there is a sufficient iron concentration. IsrR is encoded for within the opposite stand of isiA gene and contains a conserved [[stem loop]] secondary structure. Under sufficient iron conditions IsrR binds to its complementary region which corresponds to the central third of the isiA [[mRNA]]. The resulting duplex RNA is then targeted for degradation. This allows the antisense RNA to act as a reversible switch that responds to changes in environmental conditions to modulate the expression of the isiA protein.

IsrR was originally identified within cyanobacteria but may be conserved throughout a number of photosynthetic species from multiple kingdoms. At present, IsrR is the only non coding RNA identified that has a regulatory role on photosynthetic proteins.

'''Juice fasting''', also known as '''juice cleansing''', is a [[fad diet]] in which a person consumes only [[fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]]s while abstaining from solid food consumption. It is used for [[detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], an [[alternative medicine]] treatment, and is often part of [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)#Detox diets|detox diets]]. The diet can typically last for two to seven days and involve a number of fruits and vegetables and even spices that are not among the juices typically sold or consumed in the average Western diet. 

This diet is sometimes promoted with implausible and unsubstantiated claims about its [[Health benefit (medicine)|health benefits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Juice Cleanses Work? 10 Truths About The Fad |date=27 May 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post |author=Valiant, Melissa |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/22/do-juice-cleanses-work_n_1372305.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Catherine Collins, chief dietician of [[St George's, University of London|St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, England, states that: "The concept of ‘[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detox]]’ is a marketing myth rather than a physiological entity. The idea that an avalanche of vitamins, minerals, and laxatives taken over a 2 to 7 day period can have a long-lasting benefit for the body is also a marketing myth."&lt;ref name="senseaboutscience.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html Debunking detox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418091439/http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html |date=2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detox diets, depending on the type and duration, are potentially dangerous and can cause various health problems including muscle loss and an unhealthy regaining of fat after the detox ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/detox-diets-purging-myths The Truth About Detox Diets]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6782">'''Konstantinos Tsioulkas''' (1845 - 1915) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] educator and writer from [[West Macedonia|Western Macedonia]].

== Biography ==
Tsioulkas was born in 1845 in Gorenchi (now Koresos), [[Kastoria]]. Most of the inhabitants of the village had a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] first language, but Tsioulkas spoke Greek as his first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation from the main school of his village he continued his studies with a scholarship in the Educational Association of Kastoria in the Gymnasium of Kasoria and then he taught in the "Greek school" of his birthplace. He opposed the attempts of the [[Exarchists]] to hold the [[Divine Liturgy]] in Bulgarian&lt;ref name="Dragati"&gt;{{harvnb|Δραγάτη|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1871 he succeeded together with others to drive Konstantinos Darzilovites, who, according to Tsioulkas, was the first to teach the Slavic speakers that they were [[Bulgarians]], off Gorenchi, just before a Bulgarian school was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875 he was sent with a scholarship from [[Konstantinos Bellios|Bellios]] a bequest in [[Athens]], where he studied in the Philosophic School of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|National University]]. In 1879 he went to [[Bitola|Monastiri (Bitola)]], where he became the first [[gymnasiarch]] of the Greek gymnasium for a decade, until 1889, when he was fired because of the events relating to [[Anastasios Pichion|Pichion]].&lt;ref name="Dragati"/&gt;

==''Contributions to the bilingualism of the Macedonians''==
[[File:Simvolai_Eis_Tin_Siglossan_Ton_Makedonon_1.png|thumb|317x317px|The first edition of the ''Contributions'' of Tsioulkas (Athens: Petrakos, 1907).]]
In 1907 he published in Athens a 350-page work of his ''Contributions to the bilingualism of the Macedonians by comparing the Slavic-seeming Macedonian language with the Greek one'' ("Συμβολαί εις την διγλωσσίαν των Μακεδόνων εκ συγκρίσεως της σλαυοφανούς μακεδονικής γλώσσης προς την ελληνικήν"),&lt;ref name="Tsioulkas"&gt;{{harvnb|Τσιούλκας|1907|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to fight against the [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] propaganda in the [[region of Macedonia]]. Tsioulkas, who claimed not to speak any Slavic language, tried by distorting [[historical linguistics]] to prove that the language of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia]] wasn't Bulgarian, but an [[Ancient Greek dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Ioannidou|1999|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsioulkas didn't focus on [[phonology]], [[syntax]], or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for which he only devoted 11 pages in total,&lt;ref name="Mackridge 2011 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly on the [[vocabulary]], where it is easy to find words with common, [[Indoeuropean|Indo-European]], etymology with Greek, in order to show that the basic elements of the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] vocabulary weren't Slavic, but originated from Greek.&lt;ref name="Mac2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2009|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove that the language of the Slavophones was closer to Ancient Greek than Modern Greek, he composed a list of homeric words and compared how many of them survive in the "people's" language, meaning demotic, (650) and how many in the "Slavic-seeming Macedonian" (1260).&lt;ref name="Mackridge 2011 5"/&gt; The conclusion, for Tsioulkas, was that the "Slavic-seeming Macedonian [language] was a sister of the Greek [language]" and the "Macedonian people" was native and descended from the Ancient Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Antiscience|anti-scientific]] book was the most important in a series of pseudo-linguistic publications that appeared in Greece from the beginning to the middle of the 20th century, whose writers without knowing the dialects they were writing about maintained that the "mixed" or "Slavic-seeming" dialects of the Slavophones weren't Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ioannidou|1999|pp=56–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Greek linguist supported Tsioulkas' theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the book was republished in 1991, during the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], without negative commentary, but with a commendatory exordium of the former minister [[Nikolaos Martis]].&lt;ref name="Mac2009"/&gt; The book is still in circulation today{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and references to it continue to appear online, resulting in Tsioulkas having unwittingly contributed to the idea that modern [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] are descended from [[Ancient Macedonians]] and are their true inheritors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kozyrev mirror''', in Russian [[esoteric]] literature from 1990s, is a device made from [[aluminum]] (sometimes from glass, or reflecting mirror-like material) spiral shape surfaces, which, according to a non-proved [[hypothesis]], are able to focus different types of [[radiation]]  including that coming from biological objects.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They are named after the famous astronomer [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev]], though they were neither invented nor described by him.

Kozyrev mirrors were used in experiments related to [[extrasensory perception|extrasensory perception (ESP)]], conducted in the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Siberia, division of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Humans, allocated into the cylindrical spirals  (usually 1.5 rotations clockwise, made of polished aluminum) allegedly experienced anomalous psycho-physical sensations, which had been recorded in the minutes of the research experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия чудес, загадок и тайн (Encyclopaedia of miracles, riddles and mysteries)|url=http://biblioteka.org.ua/book.php?id=1121023160&amp;p=30|year=2006|publisher=|location=Moskva|isbn=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kozyrev mirrors were shown in a documentary on the Russian state TV channel&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJ3FvUBX4E&lt;/ref&gt; and articles about them were published in tabloid newspapers in Russia and Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;http://novaya.com.ua/?/articles/2008/06/11/153126-11&lt;/ref&gt; but not in scientific journals.

There is a claim that during one of early experiments in the arctic village of Dixon, scientists placed an ancient symbol of Trinity into a mirror installation. Almost immediately there formed a field of force around the setup. The experiment was led by Vlail Kaznacheev MD, PhD, Academic Member of the Russian Academy of Medical Science {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

A 1998 Russian [[patent]], RU2122446, "Device for the correction of man's psychosomatic diseases", relates to Kozyrev mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RU212244: Device for correction of man's psychosomatic diseases|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19490059/RU2122446-KOZYREV-MIRROR-PATENT-DEVICE-FOR-CORRECTION-OF-MAN-S-PSYCHOSOMATIC-DISEASES|website=Scribd|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a Czech Republic group attempted, but failed, to [[crowdfunding|crowdfund]] 17,000-20,000 Euros for development of Kozyrev mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kozyrev Mirror Project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">The '''Laschamp event''' was a short [[Geomagnetic excursion|reversal of the Earth's magnetic field]].  It occurred 41,400 (±2,000) years ago during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] and was first recognised in the late 1960s as a geomagnetic reversal recorded in the  Laschamp lava flows in the [[Clermont-Ferrand]] district of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonhommet |first=N. |author2=Zähringer, J. |year=1969 |title=Paleomagnetism and potassium argon age determinations of the Laschamp geomagnetic polarity event |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=6 |pages=43–46 |doi=10.1016/0012-821x(69)90159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic excursion has since been demonstrated in geological archives from many parts of the world. The period of reversed magnetic field was approximately 440 years, with the transition from the normal field lasting approximately 250 years. The reversed field was 75% weaker, whereas the strength dropped to only 5% of the current strength during the transition. This reduction in geomagnetic field strength resulted in more [[cosmic rays]] reaching the [[Earth]], causing greater production of the [[Cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic isotopes]] [[beryllium 10]] and [[carbon 14]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-10-extremely-reversal-geomagnetic-field-climate.html |title=An extremely brief reversal of the geomagnetic field, climate variability and a super volcano|last=Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laschamp event was the first known geomagnetic excursion and remains the most thoroughly studied among the known geomagnetic excursions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://booksite.elsevier.com/brochures/geophysics/PDFs/00095.pdf |website=elsevier.com |title=5.10 Geomagnetic Excursions |accessdate=31 January 2018 |date=2007 |first1=C. |last1=Laj |first2=J.

The '''life sciences''' or '''biological sciences''' comprise the [[branches of science]] that involve the scientific study of [[life]] and [[organism]]s – such as [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s including [[human being]]s. 

Life science is one of the two major branches of [[natural science]], the other being [[physical Science|physical science]], which is concerned with non-living matter. 

By definition, [[biology]] is the [[natural science]] that studies life and living organisms, with the other life sciences being its sub-disciplines. 

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, [[zoology]] is the study of [[animals]], while [[botany]] is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as [[anatomy]] and [[genetics]]. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]]) other on larger scales (e.g. [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[ethology]], [[ecology]]). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the [[mind]]{{spaced ndash}}[[neuroscience]].

Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life, and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries.

==Basic life science branches==
{{Main|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}

[[Biology]] &amp;ndash; burst and eclectic field, composed of many branches and sub-disciplines. However, despite the complexity and the broad scope of the science, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into a single, coherent field. Here are some of biology's major branches:
* [[Anatomy]] – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms, or specifically in humans
* [[Astrobiology]] – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* [[Biochemistry]] – study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually a focus on the cellular level

*[[Bioinformatics]] &amp;ndash; developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge

* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of the biology and evolution of language
*[[Biological Anthropology|Biological anthropology]] – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids. Also known as physical anthropology
*[[Biomechanics]] – the study of the mechanics of living beings
*[[Biophysics]] – study of biological processes by applying the theories and methods that have been traditionally used in the physical sciences
*[[Botany]] – study of plants
*[[Cell biology]] – study of the cell as a complete unit, and the molecular and chemical interactions that occur within a living cell. Also known as cytology
*[[Developmental biology]] – study of the processes through which an organism forms, from zygote to full structure
*[[Ecology]] – study of the interactions of living organisms with one another and with the non-living elements of their environment

*[[Genetics]] – study of genes and heredity
*[[Histology]] – the study of tissues
*[[Immunology]] – the study of the immune system
*[[Microbiology]] – study of microscopic organisms (microorganisms) and their interactions with other living organisms
*[[Molecular biology]] – study of biology and biological functions at the molecular level, some cross over with biochemistry, genetics and microbiology
*[[Neuroscience]] – study of the nervous system
* [[Pharmacology]] – the study of drug action
* [[Physiology]] – study of the functioning of living organisms and the organs and parts of living organisms
*[[Population biology]] – study of groups of conspecific organisms
* [[Quantum biology]] – the study of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] phenomena in organisms
*[[Structural biology]] – a branch of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[biophysics]] concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules
*[[Synthetic biology]] – the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits and cells, or the redesign of existing biological systems (LY)
*[[Systems biology]] – study of the integration and dependencies of various components within a biological system, with particular focus upon the role of [[metabolic pathways]] and [[Cell signaling|cell-signaling]] strategies in physiology

{{primary sources|section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:EQbrain optical stim en.jpg|thumb|upright|Brain parts involved with a fear [[amygdala hijack]] from optical stimulus]]

*[[Biotechnology]] – manipulation of living matter, including genetic modification and synthetic biology
*[[Biocomputers]] &amp;ndash; biocomputers use systems of biologically derived molecules, such as [[DNA]] and [[proteins]], to perform computational [[calculation]]s involving storing, retrieving, and processing [[data]]. The development of biocomputers has been made possible by the expanding new science of [[nanobiotechnology]].
* [[Biocontrol]] &amp;ndash; [[File:Encarsia formosa, an endoparasitic wasp, is used for whitefly control.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Encarsia formosa]] was one of the first biological control agents developed.]] [[bioeffector]]-method of [[pest control|controlling pests]] (including [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[weed]]s and [[phytopathology|plant diseases]]) using other living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Flint, Maria Louise &amp; Dreistadt, Steve H.|editor=Clark, Jack K.|title=Natural Enemies Handbook: The Illustrated Guide to Biological Pest Control|publisher=University of California Press|date=1998|isbn=9780520218017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBJvpMqcV9UC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bioengineering]] – study of biology through the means of engineering with an emphasis on applied knowledge and especially related to biotechnology
*[[Bioelectronics]] – the electrical state of biological matter significantly affects its structure and function, compare for instance the [[membrane potential]], the signal transduction by [[neuron]]s, the [[isoelectric point]] (IEP) and so on. Micro- and nano-electronic components and devices have increasingly been combined with biological systems&lt;ref name="Birkholz2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Birkholz |author2=A. Mai |author3=C.

* [[Biomaterials]] &amp;ndash; any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. As a science, biomaterials is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]] and [[materials science]].
* [[Biomedical science]] &amp;ndash; healthcare science, also known as biomedical science, is a set of [[applied science]]s applying portions of [[natural science]] or [[formal science]], or both, to develop knowledge, interventions, or technology of use in [[healthcare]] or [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_091137?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=181510&amp;Rendition=Web |title=The Future of the Healthcare Science Workforce.

* [[Biopolymer]] &amp;ndash; [[polymer]]s produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric [[biomolecule]]s. Since they are [[polymer]]s, biopolymers contain [[monomeric]] units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: [[polynucleotide]]s ([[RNA]] and [[DNA]]), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomers]]; [[polypeptides]], which are short polymers of amino acids; and [[polysaccharides]], which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, A.K., et al., ''Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites'' (CRC Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, R., and Rustgi, R., "Biodegradable Polymers", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 23, p. 1273 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, M.A., et al., "Biological Materials: Structure &amp; Mechanical Properties", Progress in Materials Science, Vol. 53, p. 1 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A., et al., "Smart Polymers: Physical Forms &amp; Bioengineering Applications", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 32, p.1205 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental health]]  &amp;ndash; multidisciplinary field concerned with  [[environmental epidemiology]], [[toxicology]], and [[exposure science]].

'''Unsolved problems in chemistry''' tend to be questions of the kind "Can we make ''X'' chemical compound?", "Can we analyse it?", "Can we [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purify]] it?" and are commonly solved rather quickly, but may just as well require considerable efforts to be solved. However, there are also some questions with deeper implications. This article tends to deal with the areas that are the center of new [[scientific research]] in [[chemistry]]. Problems in chemistry are considered unsolved when an expert in the field considers it unsolved or when several experts in the field disagree about a solution to a problem.

==[[Physical chemistry]] problems==

* Is ''[[Feynmanium]]'' the last chemical element that can physically exist?  That is, what are the chemical consequences of having an element with an atomic number above 137, whose 1s electrons must travel faster than the speed of light?&lt;ref name="Post-Human Chemistry page 285"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem may actually occur at approximately Element 173, given the finite extension of nuclear-charge distribution.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} See the article on [[Extension of the periodic table beyond the seventh period]], and the article section [[Atomic orbital#Relativistic effects|Relativistic effects of Atomic orbital]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medical laboratory scientist''' ('''MLS'''), also traditionally referred to as a '''clinical laboratory scientist''' ('''CLS'''), is a [[healthcare professional]] who performs [[biochemistry|chemical]], [[hematology|hematological]], [[immunology|immunologic]], [[histopathological]], [[Cytopathology|cytopathological]], [[microscopy|microscopic]], and [[microbiology|bacteriological]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] analyses on [[body fluids]] such as [[blood]], [[urine]], [[sputum]], [[feces|stool]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), [[peritoneal fluid]], [[pericardial fluid]], and [[synovial fluid]], as well as other specimens. Medical laboratory scientists work in [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] at [[hospital]]s, reference labs, [[biotechnology]] labs and non-clinical industrial labs.

==Educational requirements==
Educational and licensing requirements vary by country due to differing scopes of practice and legislative differences.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, medical laboratory scientists complete a four-year undergraduate degree program in medical laboratory science or Master of Medical Laboratory science . These programs should be accredited by the Australian Institute of Medical Scientists (AIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aims.org.au/services/accredited-degrees|title=Undergraduate Courses|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Institute of Medical Scientists|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, three-year college or technical school programs are offered that include seven semesters, two of them comprising an unpaid internship. The student graduates before taking a standard examination (such as the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science, or CSMLS, exam) to be qualified as a medical laboratory technologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascp.org/PDF/BOC-PDFs/Guidelines/ExaminationContentGuidelineMLT.aspx|title=Medical Laboratory Technician, MLT (ASCP) Examination Content Guide|publisher=American Society of Clinical Pathology|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many MLTs go on to receive a bachelor of science degree after they are certified, but a few university programs affiliated with a college MLT program to allow students to graduate with both MLT certification and a degree such as the [[University of New Brunswick]]'s Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences program.

Canada is currently experiencing an increasing problem with staffing shortages in medical laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.cfnc.org/Plan/For_A_Career/Career_Cluster_Profile/Cluster_Article.aspx?articleId=mrIsdkdKHN11p9WusrheogXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX&amp;cId=0q3r9oTaRaM7wIWlpu1rhQXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX&amp;sectionId=3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, a medical laboratory scientist must complete a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science or biological or chemical science recognized by the Medical Sciences Council of New Zealand. Once they graduate they must have worked at least six months under supervision, be registered with the Medical Sciences Counsel of New Zealand, and hold a current Annual Practicing Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/science/science/medical-laboratory-scientist/|title=Medical Laboratory Scientist|last=|first=|date=|website=Careers NZ|publisher=New Zealand Government|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
In Ghana, a doctor of medical laboratory scientist (MLS.D) is a professional with a six (6) years professional [[doctorate degree]] in medical laboratory science, the medical laboratory scientist (MLS) has four (4) years [[bachelor's degree]] in medical laboratory science and the technicians has three (3) years [[diploma]] in  medical laboratory science.

The curriculum for the programme include clinical rotations, where the students get hands-on experiences in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad is the pioneer in Laboratory Sciences, College of Medical Lab Technology, (CMLT), NIH, Islamabad offers 2 years F.Sc in Medical Lab Technology (MLT), Previously 2 Years B.Sc (MLT) that was discontinued and replaced by 4 years Bachelor Program in Medical Lab Sciences. University of Health Sciences, Lahore also offering 4 year Bachelor program in Medical Lab Sciences through approved colleges. University of Lahore, University of Faisalabad, University of Sargodha and Superior University Lahore offering 5-years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) Program; Eligibility criteria for 4 years BS Medical Lab Sciences and 5 years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) is F.Sc Pre-Medical.

===United States===
In the United States, a medical laboratory scientist (MLS), medical technologist (MT), or a clinical laboratory scientist (CLS) typically earns a [[bachelor's degree]] in medical laboratory science, clinical laboratory science, or medical technology.  Other routes include attaining a degree in biomedical science or in a life / biological science (biology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.), in which a case certification from an accredited training program is also required.

Common comprehensive Medical laboratory scientist degree programs are set up in a few different ways. 
* In 3+1 programs, the student attends classroom courses for three years and complete a clinical rotation their final year of study. 
* In 2+2 programs, students have already completed their lower division coursework and return to complete their last two years of study in a CLS program.  
* In 4+1 program, students who have already completed an undergraduate program return to complete a year of medical laboratory training. The training is typically completed at a clinical site rather than a college.
The core curriculum in medical technology generally comprises 20 credits in clinical chemistry, 20 credits in hematology, and 20 credits in clinical microbiology.

During clinical rotations, the student experiences hands-on learning in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. With limited or no compensation, a student in the clinical phase of training usually works 40 hours per week for 20 to 52 weeks. Some programs in the United States have had the time students spend completing their clinical rotation reduced due to staffing shortages. For example, in 2015, the MLS program at the University of Minnesota reduced the clinical rotation portion of the program from 22 weeks to 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/november/the-laboratory-workforce-shortage-demands-new-solutions|title=The Laboratory Workforce Shortage Demands New Solutions|last=Scott|first=Kimberly|date=2015-11-01|website=AACC|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a two year academic program ([[associate's degree]]) qualifies the graduate to work as a medical laboratory technician (MLT). MLTs receive training more exclusively in laboratory sciences without the basic science coursework often required by MLS programs; however, there are many MLT training programs that require substantial basic didactic science course work prior to entry into a clinical practicum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/the-hidden-profession-that-saves-lives|title=The hidden profession that saves lives|last=Rohde|first=Rodney|date=2014-02-11|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the didactic coursework may be less for the MLT, the clinical practicum, in many cases, is similar to that of the MLS student's. This equates to MLTs who are well equipped to enter the work force with relevant and knowledge based practical application.  The shorter training time may be attractive to many students, but there are disadvantages to this route. MTs, MLSs and CLSs usually earn higher salaries and have more responsibilities than MLTs.  In 2018, medical laboratory technicians earned an average salary of $51,219, while medical laboratory scientists earned a salary of $67,888.&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.salary.com/medical-laboratory-technician-Salary.html&lt;/ref&gt; An added disadvantage for MLTs is that some institutions will only employ MLSs, although that practice is starting to change due to recent efforts in cost reduction, and due to staffing shortages. 

In practice, the term ''medical laboratory technician'' may apply to persons who are trained to operate equipment and perform tests, usually under the supervision of the certified medical technologist or laboratory scientist. Depending on the state where employment is granted, the job duties between MLSs and MLTs may or may not be similar. For example, in Florida, an MLT may only perform highly complex testing while under the direct supervision of a clinical laboratory technologist, a clinical laboratory supervisor, or a clinical laboratory director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fshgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rules-and-Regulations-2014-NT.pdf Board of Clinical Laboratory Personnel&lt;/ref&gt; This may make it impractical for an MLT to lawfully work in a Florida blood bank. California has similar restrictions on MLTs. To accommodate California's restrictions, the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) developed a separate certification examination for California licensure. However, this exam does not include material covering the areas of immunohematology or microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aab.org/aab/California_CLS_and_MLT.asp ABOR Certification California&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the typical entry-level academic requirement for most MLTs is an associate degree, a 60 credit certificate program exists through military training programs; such as the U.S. Army's 68K military occupational specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/medical-and-emergency/medical-laboratory-specialist.html|title=Medical Laboratory Specialist|last=|first=|date=|website=Go Army|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As in other countries, staffing shortages have become a major issue in many clinical laboratories in the United States.  Due to several factors, including boomer retirement, and inadequate recruitment and retention efforts, the medical laboratory workforce is shrinking. For the decade 2010-2020, workforce needs are expected to grow by 13%.  This translates into about 11,300 positions per year that will need to be filled, with only about 5000 new graduates per year coming out of various programs.  By 2025, it is estimated that the shortage of medical laboratory professionals will reach 98,700 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/04/news/economy/health-care-workers-shortage/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.labtestingmatters.org/responding-to-the-continuing-personnel-shortages-in-laboratory-medicine/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom (UK) there are two varieties of registered healthcare scientist in hospitals - Clinical Scientists and Biomedical Scientists (BMS). There is a strict and formal post graduate training programme for both careers followed by statutory registration for each with the Health &amp; Care Professions Council UK (HCPC):[1], for the safety and assurance of the customers - the patients. They are two similar but distinct careers with parallel but different training paths and different entry requirements.

The role of Clinical Scientists is to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public by practising alongside doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals in the delivery of healthcare. Their aim is to provide expert scientific and clinical advice to clinician colleagues, to aid in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patient care.

'''Examples of the type of work they undertake include:'''

* Advising, diagnosing, interpreting, and treating patients.
* Advising health and social care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
* Researching the science, technology, and practise used in healthcare to innovate and improve services.
* Designing, building, and operating technology for diagnosing and treating patients.
* Ensuring the safety and reliability of tests and equipment used in healthcare.

Trainee Clinical Scientist posts are advertised nationally, usually between November and February on the Clinical Scientists Recruitment webpages where application forms may be obtained and electronic submission of applications can be made. These posts are for the approved Pre-registration Training Programme, designed to prepare entrants for higher professional qualifications, further clinical training and eventual Consultant responsibility.

Clinical Scientist training involves enrolment of graduates (1st or 2nd class honours degree or better is essential due to the high competition for limited training places) into an intensive 3-year training scheme leading to certification and eventual registration before starting the higher career structure. The basic qualification for becoming a Clinical Biochemist, Clinical Immunologist or Clinical Microbiologist is a good Honours degree in an appropriate subject: for Clinical Biochemistry, that subject might be Biochemistry or Chemistry (or another life science subject which contains a substantial Biochemistry component); for Clinical Immunology, that subject might be any life science degree with an immunology component; for Clinical Microbiology that subject might be any life science degree with a microbiology component.

Although not essential, some candidates will apply with higher degrees in an to attempt to improve their chances of selection for training and several universities currently offer MSc courses in Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology which have been approved by the ACB or the AHCS. Full-time and 'sandwich' courses are available, and further information may be obtained from individual programmes, although the level of financial support provided varies, and should be clarified at interview. Some entrants to the profession will already have obtained a PhD, and the training and research experience that this provides is invaluable to the work of the Clinical Scientist. In larger Departments, there may be opportunities to study for a research degree after entering the profession and acquiring registration, but since this has to be fitted in with other responsibilities, it may take some years to complete. It should be clearly understood that the major role of the profession is patient care and that research, management and all the other aspects will come as side issues and not be the predominating factor in the career path. The work of Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of almost every patient admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom is facing a shortage of qualified Clinical and Biomedical Scientists.  The Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Physicians have pointed out the need for increased government funding for medical training programs to prevent diagnostic facilities and medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.darkdaily.com/pathologists-and-physicians-in-united-kingdom-comment-on-how-shortage-of-medical-laboratory-professionals-could-soon-delay-essential-diagnostic-therapeutic-testing-206/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification and licensing==
[[File:Lab tech at microscope 2.jpg|thumb|225px|A Lab tech uses a microscope for a [[Cell counting|cell count]].]]

===United States===

There are currently three major certification agencies in the United States of America for clinical laboratory scientists. They are the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). All three national accrediting agencies will certify scientists in the clinical laboratory as generalist (chemistry, hematology, immunology, immunohematology/blood bank, and microbiology).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanmedtech.org/Get-Certified/MT-Eligibility AMT Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ascp.org/BOCRouteFinder/BOCCertificationEligibility/Index&lt;/ref&gt; The American Association of Bioanalysts and the American Medical Technologists certifications continue to use the traditional designation Medical Technologist (MT), while the American Society for Clinical Pathology has adopted the designation of Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS). Regardless of terminology, these highly qualified individuals serve as scientists in the clinical laboratory.

There are two other organizations that have previously provided proficiency examinations to clinical laboratory scientist. The first, is the US Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/HHS+sets+August+date+for+proficiency+exam.-a04788724 HHS sets August date for proficiency exam]&lt;/ref&gt; The second, is the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA). The NCA was absorbed by the American Society for Clinical Pathology in 2009 and promptly dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.darkdaily.com/single-certification-means-good-bye-to-med-techs-mts-and-clinical-lab-scientists-clss/ Dark Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]] (CLIA '88) define the level of qualification required to perform tests of various complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/clia/ Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical Laboratory Scientists, Medical Technologists and Medical Laboratory Scientists are near the highest level of qualification among general testing personnel and are usually qualified to perform the most complex clinical testing including [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] testing (also known as tissue typing) and [[blood type|blood type reference]] testing. Provider Performed Microscopy, or PPM (doctorate or master's level health provider) and Cytology have additional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/clia_required_personnel_qualifications.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/clia_required_personnel_qualifications.pdf|title=CLIA Required Personnel Qualifications|last=Olea|first=Stacy|date=|website=Joint Commission|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the national certification, 12 states (California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia and New York) and Puerto Rico also require a state license. Puerto Rico, in order to provide the state license, requires either a local board certification with a state examination, or any of both the ASCP and the NCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AN ACT TO REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, Act No. 167 of August 11, 1988 |publisher= LexJuris |date= 1997 |url=http://www.lexjuris.com/lexmate/profesiones/lex013.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont, Washington, New Jersey, Iowa, Utah, Ohio, South Carolina, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Dakota, Delaware, Missouri, and Alaska are currently attempting to obtain licensure. All states require documentation from a professional certification agency before issuing a state certification. A person applying for state certification may also be expected to submit fingerprints, education and training records, and competency certification. Some states also require completion of a specified number of continuing education contact hours prior to issuing or renewing a license.

Some states recognize another state's license if it is equal or more stringent, but currently California does not recognize any other state license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascls.org/jobs/grads/personnel_licensure.asp ASCLS licensing information]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom all clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have had to be registered with the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) in order to work unsupervised, to develop through the careers grades of their profession and to use the protected titles of "Clinical Scientist" or "Biomedical Scientist". The HCPC registers nearly 200,000 healthcare professionals[3] and while success in an approved degree course from an accredited University is sufficient for all other professions, both clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have post graduate training and no approved degree courses. Autonomous assessment of applicants in these two professions with subsequent certification for successful ones, is the only approved UK route to registration for them.

"Clinical Scientist", just as "Biomedical Scientist", is a protected title under the law (there is a £5000 fine for transgressors who fraudulently use the title without being registered by the state). The HCPC can strike people off the register for malpractice in just the same way as for doctors with the General Medical Council (GMC).

Those who are working in "Trainee" positions in the profession are permitted to use the title with an appropriate caveat, for example – "Pre-registration Clinical Scientist", Trainee Clinical Scientist, etc. Alternatively some may use titles specific to the discipline they train in, such as Trainee Clinical Biochemist", "Clinical Immunologist in Training" or “ Pre-Registrant Clinical Microbiologist” which is also perfectly acceptable since it is not implying the protected "Clinical Scientist" title of fully qualified and registered practitioners. It is against the law to formally work with the title of “Clinical Scientist” without professional registration[4].

==Specialty areas==
Many Medical Laboratory Scientists are ''generalists'', skilled in most areas of the clinical laboratory. However some are specialists, qualified by unique undergraduate education or additional training to perform more complex analyses than usual within a specific field. Specialties include [[clinical chemistry|clinical biochemistry]], [[hematology]], [[coagulation]], [[microbiology]], [[bacteriology]], [[toxicology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], [[mycology]], [[immunology]], [[immunohematology]] ([[blood bank]]), [[histopathology]], [[histocompatibility]], [[cytopathology]], [[genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[IVF]] labs. Medical Technologists specialty may use additional credentials, such as "SBB" (Specialist in Blood Banking) from the American Association of Blood Banks, "SM" (Specialist in Microbiology) from the American Society for Microbiology, "SC" (Specialist in Chemistry) from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or "SH" (Specialist in Hematology) from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). These additional notations may be appended to the base credential, for example, "MLS(ASCP)SBB".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ascp.org/PDF/BOC-PDFs/procedures/Citation-of-Credentials.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Additional information can be found in the ASCP Procedures for Examination &amp; Certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ascp.org/pdf/boc-pdfs/procedures/examination-procedures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrology Laboratory Scientist, Embryology Laboratory Scientist, and Molecular Diagnostics Technologist certifications are provided by the American Association of Bioanalysts; those with the certifications are classified as ALS(AAB), ELS(AAB), and MDxT(AAB) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aab.org/aab/Certification-Qualifications.asp|title=BOR Certification/Qualifications - ABOR|website=ABOR|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certified Histocompatibility Associate, Certified Histocompatibility Technologist, Certified Histocompatibility Specialist, and Diplomate of the ABHI are titles granted by the American Board of Hisocompatibility and Immunogenetics after meeting education and experience requirements and passing the required examination; those individuals would hold the credentials CHA(ABHI), CHT(ABHI), CHS(AHBI), and D(ABHI) upon passing the corresponding examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aab.org/aab/Certification-Qualifications.asp|title=BOR Certification/Qualifications - ABOR|website=ABOR|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashi-hla.org/images/uploads/ABHIhandbookJanuary2015CM1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Medical Laboratory Scientists can be certified and employed in [[infection control]]. These professionals monitor and report infectious disease findings to help limit [[iatrogenic]] and [[nosocomial infections]]. They may also educate other healthcare workers about such problems and ways to minimize them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbic.org/certification/candidate-handbook/eligibility-requirements Infection Control Certification&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the number of Clinical Scientists in a pathology discipline are typically greater, where less medically qualified pathologists train as consultants. Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Immunology and Genomic Medicine are specialities with an abundance of UK Clinical Scientists, and where the role is well established. Infection services in the United Kingdom are generally undertaken by medically qualified Microbiologists, who may have overall responsibility for laboratory services in addition to Infection Prevention and Control responsibilities, and may be required to contribute to ward rounds and patient clinics. Therefore, the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians have developed Combined Infection Training[10], that medical trainees gain a much more patient focused experience, and undertake Physician examinations in addition to Pathology training. The end result of this is that several regional medical deaneries no longer permit Medical Doctors to train in Microbiology or Virology as single disciplines, and instead advocate dual-specialisation as Infectious Disease/Microbiology or Infectious Disease/Virology [11]. Simultaneously the expansion of higher specialist scientist trainees in microbiology mean that many of the laboratory and scientific responsibilities of medical doctors may be taken on my Clinical Scientists, and medical doctors will instead be expected to perform a much more patient facing role. The exception in Microbiology is the sub-discipline of Virology, which is well suited to the expertise of clinical scientists due to reliance on cutting edge scientific methods, increasing use of specialised genetic technologies, and a technical understanding of virus biology, with a reduced emphasis on patient management compared with Microbiology as a whole[12].

It is therefore likely that many patients in UK hospitals may come into contact with Clinical Scientists working in a patient facing speciality, who may be confused with medical doctors due to the complex nature of their role.

== Further education ==
As in many healthcare professions, a Medical Laboratory Scientist may pursue higher education to advance or further specialize in their career.
*[[Master of Science]], [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Health Administration]], [[Doctor of medical laboratory science]] for specialization, education and management roles.

In the United Kingdom The Modernising Scientific Careers (MSC) programme sets out for the first time a comprehensive training and career framework for the whole healthcare science workforce inclusive of the more than 50 different scientific professional specialisms. In its conception it aimed to provide a coherent framework that was accessible, affordable and designed specifically to both capture scientific and technological advances and to provide improved outcomes for patients, the service and professionals. A key aspect of the framework from the start was the formalisation of training to develop talented clinical scientists to undertake quality assured Higher Specialist Scientist Training (HSST) programmes to prepare them for roles as Consultant Clinical Scientists. It is envisaged that Consultant Clinical Scientists will work synergistically and in partnership with their medical colleagues and within multiprofessional clinical teams to support clinical scientific practice aimed at quality improvement, innovation and world-class outcomes for patients. This scientific expertise and leadership will provide important benefits and added value to patients and to the service as it moves forward through the 21st century. This will bring to fruition the vision of science and realise the potential of scientific and technological advances for both translational and personalised medicine.

Training through the Higher Specialist Scientist Training pathway is discipline specific. For life science disciplines (Immunology, Microbiology, Virology, Haematology, Biochemistry) the training curriculum and formal examinations are administered by the Royal College of Pathologists. The life science training pathway for Clinical Scientists follows a similar pathway to that undertaken by medically qualified specialist registrars in pathology. Clinical Scientists are therefore the only discipline of non-medical healthcare professionals examined by a Medical Royal College. Clinical Scientists who attain both part 1 examination certification and part 2 certification are awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and are deemed to have the knowledge and expertise expected of a consultant level scientist. Consultant Clinical Scientist posts generally require candidates to have completed FRCPath qualification to be eligible.

All Clinical Scientists regardless of seniority or specialisation may have other responsibilities including academic appointments, responsibilities as clinical lead for a pathology service, or may have wider hospital responsibilities such as Directorship of Infection Prevention and Control, or responsibility for the hospital's Research and Development strategy. Junior clinical scientists may become involved in academic research, working towards award of a Ph.D. or DClinSci

==Job duties==
[[File:Lab tech.JPG|thumb|200px|MLS in his work environment]]
Medical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests – from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325091551/http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx |date=March 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical Laboratory Scientist analyzes human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician.

Medical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, "STAT" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results.

A typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP), electrolyte panel, [[liver function tests]] (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), [[urinalysis]], coagulation profile, lipid profile, [[blood type]], semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine [[Microbiology|cultures]]. In some facilities that have few [[phlebotomist]]s, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training.

Because medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter-relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings.

In the United Kingdom and the United States, senior laboratory scientists, who are typically post-doctoral scientists, take on significantly greater clinical responsibilities in the laboratory. In the United States these scientists may function in the role of clinical laboratory directors, while in the United Kingdom they are known as consultant clinical scientists.

Though clinical scientists have existed in the UK National Health Service for ~60 years, the introduction of formally trained and accredited consultant level clinical scientists is relatively new, and was introduced as part of the new Modernising Scientific Careers framework.

Consultant clinical scientists are expected to provide expert scientific and clinical leadership alongside and, at the same level as, medical consultant colleagues. While specialists in healthcare science will follow protocols, procedures and clinical guidelines, consultant clinical scientists will help shape future guidelines and the implementation of new and emerging technologies to help advance patient care.

==Role in the healthcare process==
A Medical Laboratory Scientist's role is to provide accurate laboratory results in a timely manner. An estimated 70 percent of all decisions regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatment, hospital admission and discharge are based on laboratory test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acla.com/importance-of-clinical-lab-testing-highlighted-during-medical-lab-professionals-week/|title=Importance of Clinical Lab Testing Highlighted During Medical Lab Professionals Week|last=|first=|date=2014-04-17|website=American Clinical Laboratory Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in the United Kingdom, Healthcare Scientists including Clinical Scientists may intervene throughout entire care pathways from diagnostic tests to therapeutic treatments and rehabilitation.  Although this workforce comprises approximately 5% of the healthcare workforce in the UK, their work underpins 80% of all diagnoses and clinical decisions made.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/careers-in-healthcare-science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job title==
[[File:Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg|thumb|right|Russian MLS prepares the analyses in ELISA laboratory]]
The informal abbreviations of job titles may be a source of confusion. In the United States Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) and Medical Technologists (AMT) or (AAB) are often called "med techs" (based on the era in which they were known as "medical technologists"), but this shorthand term is shared by other healthcare employees, including [[pharmacy technician|pharmacy techs]], [[radiographers]] (also known as radiologic technologists), and [[respiratory therapists]].

In the United States there is a formal distinction between an MLT and a MT/MLS. Often, MT/MLS have at least a bachelor's degree, while MLT have an associate degree. However, due to grandfathering rules and certification requirements between the boards of registry, some MT/MLS may only have an associate degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists and technologists generally earn a higher income than technicians, have more responsibilities, and have more opportunities for advancement.

In the United Kingdom, there are defined training pathways leading to professional registration as either a Clinical Scientist, or as a Biomedical Scientist. The role descriptions for these healthcare scientists are very different, where clinical scientists generally undertake non-routine research and development, as well as improving and providing clinical service using scientific expertise. Biomedical Scientists in the United Kingdom are similar to the role of MLT and MT/CLS described above, and have similar regulatory requirements for professional regulation. Clinical Scientists in the United Kingdom may struggle with a lack of professional recognition. This is in part due to the myriad job titles used to describe them including Clinical Physiologists, Medical Physicists, and Clinical Biochemists, which generally mean the public and other healthcare workers assume Clinical Scientists to be medically qualified doctors, due to the sometimes complex nature of the role.

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess]] theatres as well as [[Wembley Stadium]],&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--reversal-of-fortune-a-21yearold-has-bold-new-plans-to-save-the-mermaid-theatre-charles-nevin-meets-the-man-with-a-mission-2316506.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Charles | last=Nevin | title=Reversal of fortune: A 21-year-old has bold new plans to save the Mermaid Theatre | date=30 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the [[Johnson Matthey]] bank collapse.&lt;ref name="Offstage drama at the Mermaid"&gt;{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Neviin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/captain-moonlight-offstage-drama-at-the-mermaid-1466921.html |title= Captain Moonlight: Offstage drama at the Mermaid|publisher=The Independent|access-date= 11 April 2018 |location=London |date= 12 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutlloyds.com/fraud/myth85.html |title=Not a Myth of Hindsight: 1085 |website=Truth About Lloyds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19891101&amp;id=jEVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1612,32433 |title=Prison for millionaire who lied |work=Glasgow Herald |date=1 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[Marc Sinden]] was appointed [[artistic director]] in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Atwood |title=Sinden vows Mermaid will rival West End |work=The Stage |date=12 August 1993 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001180/19930812/034/0005|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the next year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/facethefacts 3 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Roy Marsden]] and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

==Nanotechnology in Schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the [[high school]] level. 
In the [[United States]], although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:

* The [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teacher Association]], which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher’s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* [http://www.nano-link.org Nano-Link], a notable program of the [[Dakota County Technical College]], which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* [http://www.omninano.org Omni Nano], which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog.
* [http://www.nano4me.org/ Nano4Me], which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]], which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107041954/http://www.in2nano.sabrycorp.com/ in2nano] is a high school outreach program aiming to increase [[scientific literacy]] and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]] has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at [http://www.nisenet.org www.nisenet.org] and a site for the public at [http://www.whatisnano.org www.whatisnano.org]. The NISE Network also organizes [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network#NanoDays|Nano Days]], a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

==Life==
According to her daughter Olavo had a troubled early life with maltreatment of his children. All content was wrapped in a letter that was later shared on Facebook social network. According to the letter, Olavo had even pointed a gun to the head of one of his children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nakamura |first1=Erika K |title=Em carta aberta devastadora, filha de Olavo de Carvalho acusa o pai de "colocar arma na cabeça dos seus filhos" |url=https://www.diariodocentrodomundo.com.br/essencial/em-carta-aberta-devastadora-filha-de-olavo-de-carvalho-acusa-o-pai-de-colocar-arma-na-cabeca-dos-seus-filhos/ |website=Diário do Centro do Mundo |language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olavo also accused [[Pepsi]] of using cells from [[Abortion|aborted fetuses]] to [[Sweetened beverage|sweeten]] soft drinks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Serboncini |first1=Fernando |title=Coisas em que o Olavo de Carvalho acredita |url=https://medium.com/@fserb/coisas-que-o-olavo-de-carvalho-acredita-654e1617b6eb |website=Fernando Serboncini |date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

====Science====

Olavo strongly criticizes several figures who occupy a prominent place in the history of the sciences, such as [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Giordano Bruno]], who according to him "did not make any discoveries... He did not even study modern sciences, physics, astronomy, biology or mathematics, he was not condemned for defending scientific theories, but for practicing witchcraft, which at the time was a crime". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt;, The criticism extends to Galileo, of whom he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A background of charlatanism appears to have already been introduced into physics by Galileo, when he proclaimed that he had overturned the notions of ancient science, according to which an object not propelled by an external force stands still - an illusion of the senses, he said. In fact, he pontificated, an object in such conditions remains stationary or in uniform and rectilinear motion. But, after having thus overthrown the old physics, he discreetly clarified that rectilinear and uniform movement does not really exist, but is a fiction conceived by the mind to facilitate measurements. Now if the object not moved from without stands still or has a fictitious movement, it means, strictly speaking, that it stands still in every case, just as ancient physics said, and that Galileo, by means of a new system of measurements, could only explain why it stands still. That is to say, Galileo did not dispute ancient physics, he merely invented a better way of proving that it was correct, and that the testimony of the senses, being true enough, does not have in itself proof of its veracity, which was well known since the time of Aristotle. It was this episode that inaugurated the craze of modern scientists to take simple changes of methods as if they were "proofs" of a new constitution of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is also critical of [[Georg Cantor]]'s work on [[Transfinite number|transfinite numbers]], accusing him of confusing "numbers with their mere signs," seeing his work as a "play on words" and a "false logic", &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] was invented by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] merely to obfuscate the fact that [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] was wrong and that the earth does not in fact revolve about the sun.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

He does not believe in [[global warming]], basing his arguments on the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy|Climategate]] episode in which hackers, on the eve of the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Conference]], disseminated thousands of e-mails from [[University of East Anglia]] climatologists in order to undermine the credibility of conference. In addition, Olavo claims Climategate to be the work of a conspiracy led by the [[Rockefeller family]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations|Council of Foreign Relations]] and the [[Bilderberg Meeting|Bilderberg Club]], indicating them also as leaders of the "[[Abortion|global abortion]] [...] campaigns of the new global religion, and of the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration's proposal for universal control of the movement of capital. "{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

For Olavo, [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] does not pose a risk to the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, basing his arguments on journalist [[Michael Fumento]]'s book The Myth of Heterosexual Aids, and he does not agree that AIDS has been an imminent danger to all humanity, claiming that this idea has been disseminated by the pharmaceutical industry and other groups to raise government funding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====Politics====
Olavo maintains that his ideas do not fall into an ideological category, and points out that the evaluation of a position as politically left or right wing is subjective and varies by place and historical context. Broadly speaking however, he does see himself as aligned with the American right.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In November 2018, after the Brazilian presidential election, he declared that (if invited) he would accept to be the Brazilian ambassador to the United States. He stated that, if nominated by President-elect [[Jair Bolsonaro]], this would be the only position he would accept. According to him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What Brazil needs most is money, and as an ambassador to the United States, I would be able to make money. I have some practice from this international trade business from the time I lived in Romania. I am not totally ignorant in international trade. [...] The ambassador to a foreign other country has full authority over his countrymen there. He can kick out whoever he likes, he can have anyone arrested. He's a king."&lt;ref name="ambass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2018/11/06/interna_politica,717731/olavo-de-carvalho-diz-que-gostaria-de-ser-embaixador-do-brasil-nos-eua.shtml|title=Olavo de Carvalho diz que gostaria de ser embaixador do Brasil nos EUA|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|date=2018-11-06|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11414">The '''Polymath Project''' is a collaboration among [[mathematician]]s to solve important and difficult [[Mathematics|mathematical]] problems by coordinating many mathematicians to communicate with each other on finding the best route to the solution. The project began in January 2009 on [[Timothy Gowers]]' blog when he posted a problem and asked his readers to post partial ideas and partial progress toward a solution.&lt;ref name="reinventing" /&gt; This experiment resulted in a new answer to a difficult problem, and since then the Polymath Project has grown to describe a particular process of using an online collaboration to solve any math problem.

==Origin==
In January 2009, Gowers chose to start a [[social experiment]] on his [[blog]] by choosing an important unsolved mathematical problem and issuing an invitation for other people to help solve it collaboratively in the comments section of his blog.&lt;ref name="reinventing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=[[Reinventing discovery : the new era of networked science]]|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14890-8|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the math problem itself, Gowers asked a question which was included in the title of his blog post, "is massively collaborative mathematics possible?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gowers|first=Tim|title=Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/|work=Gowers' weblog|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowers | first1 = T. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/461879a | title = Massively collaborative mathematics | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7266 | pages = 879–881 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19829354 | pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..879G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This post led to his creation of the Polymath Project.

==Projects for high school and college==
Since its inception, it has now sponsored a "[https://artofproblemsolving.com/polymath Crowdmath]" project in collaboration with [[MIT PRIMES]] program and the [[Art of Problem Solving]]. This project is built upon the same idea of the Polymath project that massive collaboration in mathematics is possible and possibly quite fruitful. However, this is specifically aimed at only high school and college students with a goal of creating "a specific opportunity for the upcoming generation of math and science researchers." The problems are original research and unsolved problems in mathematics. All high school and college students from around the world with advanced background of mathematics are encouraged to participate. Older participants are welcomed to participate as mentors and encouraged not to post solutions to the problems. The first Crowdmath project began on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Crowdmath" project for high school students opens on March 1|url=http://polymathprojects.org/2016/01/02/crowdmath-project-for-high-school-students-opens-on-march-1/|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CROWDMATH|url=http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/polymath/mitprimes2016/f/c195578h1177036_welcome_to_crowdmath|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems solved==

===Polymath1===
The initial proposed problem for this project, now called Polymath1 by the Polymath community, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the [[Hales–Jewett theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gowers |first=Tim |title=A combinatorial approach to density Hales-Jewett |date=1 February 2009 |work=Gower's Weblog |url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/a-combinatorial-approach-to-density-hales-jewett/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the project took form, two main threads of discourse emerged. The first thread, which was carried out in the comments of Gowers's blog, would continue with the original goal of finding a combinatorial proof.  The second thread, which was carried out in the comments of [[Terence Tao]]'s blog, focused on calculating bounds on density of [[Hales-Jewett number]]s and [[Moser number]]s for low dimensions.

After seven weeks, Gowers announced on his blog that the problem was "probably solved",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=584|title=The Polymath project: scope of participation|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though work would continue on both Gowers's thread and Tao's thread well into May 2009, some three months after the initial announcement.  In total over 40 people contributed to the Polymath1 project. Both threads of the Polymath1 project have been successful, producing at least two new papers to be published under the [[pseudonym]] '''D.H.J. Polymath''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1009.3956|author1=Polymath|title=Deterministic methods to find primes|class=math.NT|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1002.0374|author1=Polymath|title=Density Hales-Jewett and Moser numbers|class=math.CO|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0910.3926|author1=Polymath|title=A new proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem|class=math.CO|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the initials refer to the problem itself ('''d'''ensity '''H'''ales-'''J'''ewett).

===Polymath5===
This project was set up in order to try to solve the [[Erdős discrepancy problem]]. It was active for much of 2010 and had a brief revival in 2012, but did not end up solving the problem. However, in September 2015, [[Terence Tao]], one of the participants of Polymath5, solved the problem in a pair of papers. One paper proved an averaged form of the Chowla and Elliott conjectures, making use of recent advances in analytic number theory concerning correlations of values of multiplicative functions. The other paper showed how this new result, combined with some arguments discovered by Polymath5, were enough to give a complete solution to the problem. Thus, Polymath5 ended up making a significant contribution to the solution.

===Polymath8===
The Polymath8 project&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes Polymath8 project].&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed to improve the bounds for small gaps between primes. It has two components:

* Polymath8a, "Bounded gaps between primes", was a project to improve the bound H=H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the least gap between consecutive primes that was attained infinitely often, by developing the techniques of [[Yitang Zhang]]. This project concluded with a bound of H = 4,680.
* Polymath8b, "Bounded intervals with many primes", was a project to improve the value of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; further, as well as H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (the least gap between primes with m-1 primes between them that is attained infinitely often), by combining the Polymath8a results with the techniques of [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]]. This project concluded with a bound of H=246, as well as additional bounds on H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

Both components of the Polymath8 project have been successful, producing two new papers, one of which was published under the pseudonym '''D.H.J. Polymath'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|doi=10.2140/ant.2014.8.2067|title=New equidistribution estimates of Zhang type|year=2014|volume=8|journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory|pages=2067–2199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|title=Variants of the Selberg sieve, and bounded intervals containing many primes|doi=10.1186/s40687-014-0012-7|year=2014|volume=1|journal=Research in the Mathematical Sciences|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practice research''' is a form of academic [[research]] which incorporates an element of practice in the [[methodology]] or research output.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Rather than seeing the relationship between practice and theory as a dichotomy, as has sometimes traditionally been the case (see [[academia]]: theory and practice heading), there is a growing body of practice research academics across a number of disciplines who use practice as part of their research. For example, the [[practice-based research network]] (PBRN) within clinical [[medical research]].

==Practice-led research in the arts and design==
Within [[arts]] and [[humanities]] departments there are ongoing debates about how to define this emerging research phenomenon, and there are a variety of models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based, practice-led, mixed-mode research practice and practice through research), see for example [[screen media practice research]]. The potential, nature and scope for this research has been debated from the 1990s. Sir Christopher Frayling in 1993 adapted Herbert Read's model of education through art to describe different ways of thinking about research, noting that research could be FOR practice, where research aims are subservient to practice aims, THROUGH practice, where the practice serves a research purpose, or INTO practice, such as observing the working processes of others.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, C. (1993) Research in art and design. Royal College of Art: Research
Paper&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Archer's statement in 1995 shows the growing recognition of arts practice as research at this time, "There are circumstances where the best or only way to shed light on a proposition, a principle, a material, a process or a function is to attempt to construct something, or to enact something, calculated to explore, embody or test it.".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, B. (1995) The Nature of Research Co-Design Jan 95 6-13&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the acceptance of practice research in these disciplines to be reviewed alongside traditional research disciplines in the sphere of [[Higher Education]] a debate supported by the work of Michael Biggs, John Freeman, Kristina Niedderer, Katy Macleod, Darren Newbury and others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The UK's [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] had a steering committee devoted to practice-led research and its report was completed in September 2007.,&lt;ref&gt;AHRC Research Review: Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (2007) 
Rust, Prof Chris, Mottram, Prof Judith, Till, Prof Jeremy, with support from Kirsty Smart, Peter Walters Mark Elshaw&lt;/ref&gt; titled AHRC Research Review in Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (Rust, Mottram, Till). This informed continuing discussions by the Council for Higher Education in Art &amp; Design (CHEAD) and the AHRC resulting in an evolved notion of practice as research in art, design and architecture, media, and creative writing. This in turn brought an increasing recognition in the UK of the ways in which creative departments contribute to research culture, a potential which informs elements of the Research Excellence Framework 2014.

'''Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact''' theories relate to visits or interactions with the [[Americas]] and/or [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by  people from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], or [[Oceania]] before [[Columbus's first voyage]] to the [[Caribbean]] in 1492.&lt;ref name="RileyKelley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carroll L.

Two historical cases of pre-Columbian contact are accepted amongst the scientific and scholarly mainstream. Successful explorations led to [[History of Greenland#Norse settlement|Norse settlement of Greenland]] and the [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] settlement in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]&lt;ref name="CordellLightfoot2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda S.

The scientific and scholarly responses to other post-[[prehistory]], pre-Columbian contact claims have varied. Some such contact claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed sources. Other contact claims, typically based on circumstantial and ambiguous interpretations of archaeological finds, cultural comparisons, comments in historical documents, and narrative accounts, have been dismissed as [[fringe science]] or [[pseudoarcheology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Beck Kehoe]] (2003)[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_17_1_kehoe.pdf The Fringe of American Archaeology: Transoceanic and Transcontinental Contacts in Prehistoric America].

[[Vikings |Norse]] journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence. A Norse colony in [[Greenland]] was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (''[[Thing (assembly)|þing]]'') taking place at [[Brattahlíð]] and a bishop at [[Gardar, Greenland|Garðar]].&lt;ref name="WurmMühlhäusler1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Few sources describing contact between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and Norse people exist. Contact between the [[Thule people]] (ancestors of the modern [[Inuit]]) and Norse between the 12th or 13th centuries is known. The Norse Greenlanders called these incoming settlers "[[skræling]]ar". Conflict between the Greenlanders and the "skrælings" is recorded in the ''[[Icelandic Annals]]''. The term skrælings is also used in the Vínland sagas, which relate to events during the 10th century, when describing trade and conflict with native peoples.&lt;ref name="Seaver2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsten A.

== Claims of Polynesian contact ==

=== Claims involving sweet potato ===
The [[sweet potato]], which is native to the Americas, was widespread in [[Polynesia]] when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the [[Cook Islands]] to 1000 CE, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 CE and spread across [[Polynesia]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994. Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langdon | first1 = Robert | year = 2001 | title = The Bamboo Raft as a Key to the Introduction of the Sweet Potato in Prehistoric Polynesia | url = | journal = The Journal of Pacific History | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 51–76| doi=10.1080/00223340123312}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was brought by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, or that South Americans brought it to the Pacific. It is possible that the plant could successfully float across the ocean if discarded from the cargo of a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000805|title=Modeling the prehistoric arrival of the sweet potato in Polynesia | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.04.004 | volume=35|issue=2 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|pages=355–367|year=2008 |last1=Montenegro |first1=Álvaro |last2=Avis |first2=Chris |last3=Weaver |first3=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetic]] analysis supports the hypothesis of at least two separate introductions of sweet potatoes from South America into Polynesia, including one before and one after European contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roullier, Caroline|title=Historical collections reveal patterns of diffusion of sweet potato in Oceania obscured by modern plant movements and recombination|work=PNAS|volume=110|issue=6|date=January 22, 2013|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/6/2205 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211049110|pmid=23341603|pages=2205–2210|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.2205R|pmc=3568323}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[#Linguistics]].)

=== Claims involving Peruvian mummies ===
A team of academics headed by the [[University of York]]'s Mummy Research Group and BioArch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/magazine/aprilmag08.pdf |title=28801_April08.indd |publisher=York.ac.uk |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while examining a Peruvian mummy at the [[Bolton Museum]], found that it had been embalmed using a tree [[resin]].  Before this it was thought that Peruvian mummies were naturally preserved. The resin, found to be that of an ''[[Araucaria]]'' [[Pinophyta|conifer]] related to the [[Araucaria araucana|'monkey puzzle tree']], was from a variety found only in [[Oceania]] and probably [[New Guinea]]. "Radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the University of Oxford's radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary, and date to around CE 1200."&lt;ref&gt;From the University of York Magazine, page 9, April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving California canoes ===
[[File:Chumash Tomol 'Elye'wun paddlers, CINMS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''‘Elye’wun'', a reconstructed Chumash [[tomol]]]]
Researchers including Kathryn Klar and Terry Jones have proposed a theory of contact between Hawaiians and the [[Chumash people]] of [[Southern California]] between 400 and 800 CE. The sewn-plank canoes crafted by the Chumash and neighboring [[Tongva people|Tongva]] are unique among the indigenous peoples of North America, but similar in design to larger canoes used by Polynesians for deep-sea voyages. ''[[Tomol|Tomolo'o]]'', the [[Chumash language|Chumash]] word for such a craft, may derive from ''kumula'au'', the Hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into canoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/20/MNG9GDBBLG1.DTL Did ancient Polynesians visit California?

If it occurred, this contact left no genetic legacy in California or Hawaii.

=== Claims involving chickens ===
The existence of chicken bones dating from 1321 to 1407 in Chile and thought to be genetically linked to South Pacific Island chicken landraces suggested further evidence of South Pacific contact with South America. The genetic link between the South American [[Mapuche]] (to whom the chickens were thought to originally belong)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0801/topten/chicken.html|title=Top 10 Discoveries of 2007 – Polynesian Chickens in Chile – Archaeology Magazine Archive|work=archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; chicken bones and South Pacific Island species has been rejected by a more recent genetic study which concluded that "The analysis of ancient and modern specimens reveals a unique Polynesian genetic signature" and that "a previously reported connection between pre-European South America and Polynesian chickens most likely resulted from contamination with modern DNA, and that this issue is likely to confound ancient DNA studies involving haplogroup E chicken sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Vicki A|first2=Ophélie |last2=Lebrasseur |first3=Jeremy J. |last3=Austin |first4=Terry L. |last4=Hunt |first5=David A. |last5=Burney |first6=Tim |last6=Denham |first7=Nicolas J. |last7=Rawlence |first8=Jamie R. |last8=Wood |first9=Jaime |last9=Gongor |first10=Linus Girdland |last10=Flink |first11=Anna |last11=Linderholm |first12=Keith |last12=Dobney |first13=Greger |last13=Larson |first14=Alan |last14=Cooper|title=Using ancient DNA to study the origins and dispersal of ancestral Polynesian chickens across the Pacific|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=April 1, 2014|volume=111|issue=13|pages=4826–4831|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320412111|pmid=24639505|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/13/4826.full |pmc=3977275|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.4826T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguistics ===
[[File:Thames Kumara n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sweet potatoes for sale, Thames, New Zealand. The name "kumara" has entered [[New Zealand English]] from [[Māori language|Māori]], and is in wide use.]]

Dutch linguists and specialists in [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] [[Willem Adelaar]] and Pieter Muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America. One is the name of the [[#Claims involving sweet potato|sweet potato]], which was domesticated in the New World. [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''kumala''&lt;ref name=POLLEX-kumala&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for KUMALA.1 [LO] Sweet Potato (Ipomoea)|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kumala1/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Rapa Nui language|Easter Island]] ''kumara'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''ʻuala'',&lt;!--this is correct. an [m] was not dropped.--&gt; [[Māori language|Māori]] ''kumāra''; apparent [[cognate]]s outside [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian]] may be [[Loanword|borrowed]] from Eastern Polynesian languages, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''k’umar ~ k’umara''. A possible second is the word for 'stone axe', Easter Island ''toki'', New Zealand Maori ''toki'' 'adze', [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] ''toki'', and further afield, [[Yurumanguí language|Yurumanguí]] ''totoki'' 'axe'. According to Adelaar and Muysken, the similarity in the word for sweet potato "constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific", though according to Adelaar and Muysken the word for axe is not as convincing. The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but no migrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic relations of South American Indian languages".

[[File:Isla Mocha 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mocha Island]] off the coast of [[Arauco Peninsula]], Chile]]
In December 2007, several human skulls  were found  in a museum in [[Concepción, Chile]].  These skulls  originated from [[Mocha Island]], an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, formerly inhabited by the Mapuche. [[craniometry|Craniometric]] analysis of the skulls, according to [[Lisa Matisoo-Smith]] of the [[University of Otago]] and [[José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga]] of the [[Universidad de Valparaíso]], suggests that the skulls have "[[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] features" – such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, and rocker jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lawler |first1= Andrew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full |title=Beyond ''Kon-Tiki'': Did Polynesians Sail to South America?|journal=Science|date= June 11, 2010 |pages= 1344–1347 | pmid=20538927 | doi=10.1126/science.328.5984.1344 | volume=328 | issue=5984 |bibcode= 2010Sci...328.1344L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2009, geneticist [[Erik Thorsby]] and colleagues have published two studies in  ''[[Tissue Antigens]]'' that evidence an Amerindian genetic contribution to the Easter Island population, determining that it was probably introduced before European discovery of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00717.x |title= Molecular genetic studies of natives on Easter Island: evidence of an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool | year = 2007 | last1 = Lie | first1 = B.

In 2014, geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of The Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen published a study in ''[[Current Biology]]'' that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of [[Easter Island]] and South America, approximately 600 years ago (i.e. 1400 CE ± 100 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerholm|first1=Russell|title=Easter Island Was Not Populated Solely by the Polynesians, According to New Genetic Study|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/12415/20141024/easter-island-was-not-populated-solely-by-the-polynesians-according-to-new-genetic-study.htm|website=University Herald|accessdate=2014-12-24|date=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the now extinct [[Aimoré people|Botocudo people]], who lived in the interior of Brazil, were found in research published in 2013 to have been members of [[mtDNA haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)#Tree|B4a1a1]], which is normally found only among Polynesians and other subgroups of [[Austronesian people|Austronesians]]. This was based on an analysis of fourteen skulls. Two belonged to B4a1a1 (while twelve belonged to subclades of mtDNA  [[haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1]] common among Native Americans). The research team examined various scenarios, none of which they could say for certain were correct. They dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between Polynesia and Brazil as "too unlikely to be seriously entertained." While B4a1a1 is also found among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] (which experienced significant Austronesian settlement in prehistory), the authors described as "fanciful" suggestions that B4a1a1 among the Botocudo resulted from  the African slave trade (which included Madagascar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanessa Faria Gonçalves |author2=Jesper Stenderup |author3=Cláudia Rodrigues-Carvalho |author4=Hilton P.

=== Claims of Chinese contact ===

Norbeck, eds., Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 489—510.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Other researchers have argued that the [[Olmec]] civilization came into existence with the help of [[China|Chinese]] refugees, particularly at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;This theory is mentioned in the history book [[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]] (1963) by [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Betty Meggers]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Meggers.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that [[celt (tool)|celts]] from [[La Venta]] bear Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, ''Origin of the Olmec civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm Dr. Mike Xu's Transpacific website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802024552/http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm |date=August 2, 2001 }}, comparing Olmec and Chinese Shang period artifacts.&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Other claims have been made for early Chinese contact with North America.

In 1882 artifacts identified at the time as Chinese coins were discovered in British Columbia. A contemporary account states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=James|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=January 1884|pages=98–99|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=2450831|doi=10.1086/273578|title=Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by [[Yellow Emperor|Emperor Huungti]], 2637 BCE, and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1885, a vase containing similar discs was also discovered, wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Lily|title=Chasing their dreams : Chinese settlement in the Northwest region of British Columbia = Zhui qun meng xiang|year=2000|publisher=Caitlin Press|location=Prince George, B.C.|isbn=978-0-920576-83-0|chapter=The Gold Fever|chapterurl=http://caitlin-press.com/our-books/chasing-their-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant Keddie, Curator of Archeology at the Royal BC Museum, examined a photograph of a coin from Cassiar taken in the 1940s (whereabouts now unknown) and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground show it to be a 19th-century copy of a [[Ming Dynasty]] temple token.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Washington Indian socio-economics: papers in honor of Angelo Anastasio|year=1984|publisher=Western Washington University|page=172|author=Megan Merry McCormick|editor=Herbert C Taylor and Garland F Grabert|chapter=Chinese Coins and Pre-Columbian Asian Contacts with the Pacific Northwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Chinese Buddhist missionaries led by [[Hui Shen]] before 500 CE claimed to have visited a location called [[Fusang]].

In 1973 and 1975 doughnut-shaped stones were discovered off the coast of California that resembled stone anchors used by Chinese fishermen. These (sometimes called the ''Palos Verdes stones'') were initially thought to be up to 1500 years old and proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as [[Monterey Formation|Monterey shale]], and they are thought to have been used by Chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder|Feder, Kenneth L.]] (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum''. Westport, CN: Greenwood. page 209. {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, [[Purdue University]] published the results of research on six metal and composite metal artifacts excavated from a late prehistoric archaeological context at [[Cape Espenberg]] on the northern coast of the [[Seward Peninsula]] in [[Alaska]]. Also part of the research team was [[Robert J. Speakman]], of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the [[University of Georgia]], and [[Victor Mair]], of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The report is the first evidence that metal from Asia reached prehistoric North America before the contact with Europeans, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead. The presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric Inuit context in northwest Alaska was  demonstrated  for the first time and indicates the movement of Eurasian metal across the Bering Strait into North America before sustained contact with Europeans.
{{bquote|This is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds, and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of Eurasian metal that had been traded [...] We believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in Eurasia and traded to Siberia and then traded across the Bering Strait to ancestral {{sic|Inuits}} people, also known as Thule culture, in Alaska. Locally available metal in parts of the Arctic, such as native metal, copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient Inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status. Two of the Cape Espenberg items that were found – a bead and a buckle — are heavily leaded bronze artifacts. Both are from a house at the site dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, around 1100-1300 AD, which is before sustained European contact in the late 18th century. [...] The belt buckle also is considered an industrial product and is an unprecedented find for this time. It resembles a buckle used as part of a horse harness that would have been used in north-central China during the first six centuries before the Common Era.|author=H.

=== Claims of Japanese contact ===
[[Image:Otokichi.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otokichi]], a Japanese castaway in America in 1834, depicted here in 1849.]]
Smithsonian archaeologist [[Betty Meggers]] wrote that pottery associated with the [[Valdivia culture]] of coastal Ecuador dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the [[Jōmon period]] in [[Japan]], arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, Jomon Fishermen, and the Nature of the North Pacific: Some Nautical Problems with Meggers, Evans, and Estrada's (1965) Transoceanic Contact Thesis Gordon F. McEwan, D. Bruce Dickson American Antiquity, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul. 1978), pp. 362–371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistory of the Americas'' By Stuart J. Fiedel pp 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.

Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the [[Zuni people]] of [[New Mexico]] exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Zuni"&gt;Davis, Nancy Yaw (200). ''The Zuni Enigma''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32230-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-393-32230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zuni language]] is a [[language isolate|linguistic isolate]], and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, [[endemic disease]], and religion. Davis speculates that [[Buddhist]] priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the [[American Southwest]], and influenced Zuni society.&lt;ref name="Zuni" /&gt;

In the 1890s, lawyer and politician [[James Wickersham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, James (1892). "Origin of the Indians--The Polynesian Route." ''American Antiquarian'', 16:323-335, partly reprinted in [[William R. Corliss]], ed. (1978) ''Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts'', Glen Arm, Maryland: Sourcebook Project, {{ISBN|0-915554-03-8}} pp. 705-709&lt;/ref&gt; argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 17th century to the mid-19th century several dozen Japanese ships were carried from Asia to North America along the powerful [[Kuroshio Current]]s. Such Japanese ships landed from the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the north to [[Mexico]] in the south, carrying a total of 293 persons in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels. In 1834 a dismasted, rudderless Japanese ship crashed near [[Cape Flattery]]. Three survivors of the ship were enslaved by [[Makah people|Makahs]] for a period before being rescued by members of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. They were never able to return to their homeland due to Japan's isolationist policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9065|title=Japanese Castaways of 1834: The Three Kichis - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/japanese-retrace-path-history-making-castaways-180-years-later|title=Japanese Retrace Path Of History-Making Castaways, 180 Years Later|last=Banse|first=Tom|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Japanese ship crashed in about 1850 near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Wickersham writes, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America.

In 1879, [[Alexander Cunningham]] described the carvings on the Stupa of [[Bharhut]] from c. 200 BCE and described some fruit like detail as a custard-apple (''[[Annona squamosa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Stupa of Bharhut| author=Cunningham, Alexander| year=1879| publisher=W.H.Allen| place=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/stpabharhutabud00offigoog#page/n58/mode/2up/| page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wasn't aware that botanists believed this plant to be indigenous only in the Americas, but others quickly pointed out the difficulty, as it was generally believed that the custard-apple had not been brought to India before Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route in 1498.

The Olmec culture existed from roughly 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. The idea that the Olmecs are related to Africans was suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar, Jose (1869) "Antigüedades mexicanas, notable escultura antigua", in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 1, pp. 292–297, Mexico, as well as Melgar, Jose (1871) "Estudio sobre la antigüedad y el origen de la Cabeza Colosal de tipo etiópico que existe en Hueyapan del cantón de los Tuxtlas" in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 3, pp. 104–109; Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ivan Van Sertima]] has argued that these statues depict settlers or explorers from Africa, but his views have been the target of severe scholarly criticism.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/vansertima.pdf CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Robbing Native Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs]," in ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 38, no. 3 (June 1997), 419-441&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Wiener]]'s "Africa and the Discovery of America" suggests similarities between [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and native Mesoamerican religious symbols such as the winged serpent and the sun disk, or Quetzalcoatl, and words that have Mande roots and share similar meanings across both cultures such as "kore", "gadwal", and "qubila" (in Arabic) or "kofila" (in Mandinka). &lt;ref&gt;Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, Philadelphia, p259, Inness and Sons, 1922, Vol 3 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1921), pp. 83-94 &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solutrean hypothesis]] argues that Europeans migrated to the New World during the [[Paleolithic]] era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the [[Solutrean culture]] in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the [[Clovis culture]] of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Claims involving ancient Roman contact ===

Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of [[Classical Antiquity]]—primarily with the [[Roman Empire]], but sometimes also with other cultures of the age—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble [[Amphora#Ancient Rome|Roman amphorae]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&amp;kv=87136&amp;t=objects&lt;/ref&gt; for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman wreck, although it has been suggested that they could be 15th or 16th century Spanish olive oil jars.

Romeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the American shores, is a possible explanation of archaeological finds (like the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) from ancient Rome in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels from Romans to [[Tenerife]] and [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on [[Lanzarote|Lanzarote island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hristov|first1=Romeo H.|last2=Genovés T.|first2=Santiago|year=1999|title=Mesoamerica evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=10|pages=207–213|doi=10.1017/S0956536199102013|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, suggested that a depiction of a [[pineapple]] was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at [[Pompeii]]. According to [[Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski]], this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine [[conifer cone|cone]] from the [[Stone Pine|Umbrella pine tree]], which is native to the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jashemski |first=Wilhelmina |title=The natural history of Pompeii |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-80054-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xfjyTqqR7IC&amp;pg=PA81 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head}}

A small [[terracotta]] head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 (in the [[Toluca Valley]], 72 kilometres southwest of [[Mexico City]]) in a burial offering under three intact floors of a [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|pre-colonial]] building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist [[Robert von Heine-Geldern]], both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century. If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510)&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. ''The American Discovery of Europe'' University of Illinois Press;  April 16, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-252-03152-6}} p.108&lt;/ref&gt; the find provides evidence for at least a one-time contact between the Old and New Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Hristov and Genovés (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arizona State University|ASU]]'s Michael E. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/"&lt;/ref&gt; John Paddock, a leading Mesoamerican scholar, used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried Post-classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., "[http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/tval/RomanFigurine.html The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca]".

Henry was the grandfather of [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]], the builder of [[Rosslyn Chapel]] (near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland).

Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called [[Thule]] in 1477. Whether he actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited [[Bristol]] in 1476.&lt;ref&gt;"It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). ''The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1'', University of Michigan press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-13-142670-2}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol was also the port from which [[John Cabot]] sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498 the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot's discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was "discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found 'Brasil' as your lordship knows".&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995) p.222&lt;/ref&gt; There may be records of expeditions from [[Bristol]] to find the "[[Brazil (mythical island)|isle of Brazil]]" in 1480 and 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, K.A.(1995) ''The Frozen Echo'' Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3161-6}} p.221&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid 15th century.

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] records several such legends in his ''General y natural historia de las Indias'' of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The ship's pilot, a man called [[Alonso Sánchez]],  and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus, Christopher; Cohen, J. M. (translator) (May 5, 1992). ''The Four Voyages'', pp. 27–37.

In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476.

[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|Saint Brendan and the whale. From a 15th-century manuscript.]]
The legend of Saint [[Brendan]], an Irish monk, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic Ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century.  Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan legend with an early discovery of America. In 1977 The voyage was successfully recreated by [[Tim Severin]] using an ancient Irish [[Currach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/16/did-st-brendan-reach-north-america-500-years-before-the-vikings/|title=Did St. Brendan Reach North America 500 Years Before the Vikings? – National Geographic Society (blogs)|first=Andrew|last=Howley|website=voices.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British myth, [[Madoc]] was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used as justification for British claims to the Americas, based on the notion of a Briton arriving before other European nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gwyn A (1979): ''Madoc: The Making of a Myth''.

== Claims of trans-oceanic travel originating from the New World ==

=== Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco ===
[[File:RAMmummy.jpg|right|thumb|The [[mummy]] of [[Ramesses II]]]]

Traces of [[coca]] and [[nicotine]] found in some Egyptian mummies have led to speculation that [[Ancient Egyptians]] may have had contact with the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German [[toxicologist]], Svetlana Balabanova, after examining the mummy of a priestess called [[Henut Taui]]. Follow-up tests of the hair shaft, performed to rule out contamination, gave the same results.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm"&lt;/ref&gt;

A television show reported that examination of numerous [[Sudan|Sudanese]] mummies undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui.&lt;ref name="Curseof"&gt;"Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt; Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in [[Munich]] disputes this.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Skeptical of Balabanova's findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the [[Manchester Museum]], had similar tests performed on samples taken from the Manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for nicotine.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the Old World are discussed by the British biologist Duncan Edlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=A look at the Evidence for Cocaine in Mummies |publisher=Thehallofmaat.com |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=The Stoned Age? |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Panagiotakopulu | first2 = E | title = Rameses II and the tobacco beetle | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 75 | issue = 549–56| page = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two attempts to replicate Balabanova's finds of cocaine failed, suggesting "that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;Counsell, D.

A re-examination in the 1970s of the mummy of [[Ramesses II]] revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator, [[Maurice Bucaille]], noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and that "it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment."&lt;ref&gt;Bucaille, M. ''Mummies of the Pharaohs: Modern Medical Investigations'' NY: St. Martin’s Press pp 186-188&lt;/ref&gt; Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabanova's research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies "ignored their post-excavation histories" and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.&lt;ref name="Buckland" /&gt;

=== Icelander DNA finding ===
In 2010 Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA of a new type that is similar to the type found only in Native American and East Asian populations. Using the [[deCODE genetics]] database, Sigríður Sunna determined that the DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and likely several centuries earlier.  However Sigríður Sunna also states that "...while a Native American origin seems most likely for [this new haplogroup], an Asian or European origin cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21419|pmid=21069749|title=A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=144|issue=1|pages=92–9|year=2011|last1=Ebenesersdóttir|first1=Sigríður Sunna|last2=Sigurðsson|first2=Ásgeir|last3=Sánchez-Quinto|first3=Federico|last4=Lalueza-Fox|first4=Carles|last5=Stefánsson|first5=Kári|last6=Helgason|first6=Agnar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norse legends and sagas ===
[[Image:Thorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|thumb|150px|Statue of Thorfinn Karlsefni.]]
In 1009, legends report that Norse explorer [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] abducted two children from [[Markland]], an area on the North American mainland where Norse explorers visited but did not settle. The two children were then taken to Greenland, where they were baptized and taught to speak Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm Eirik the Red's Saga by John Sephton] paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1420, Danish geographer [[Claudius Clavus Swart]] wrote that he personally had seen "[[pygmies]]" from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]] along with another, longer boat also taken from "pygmies". Clavus Swart's description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the [[kayak]] and the [[umiak]].&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA /&gt; Similarly, the Swedish clergyman [[Olaus Magnus]] wrote in 1505 that he saw in [[Oslo Cathedral]] two leather boats taken decades earlier. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the [[Haakon (disambiguation)|Haakons]], which would place the event in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;

In [[Ferdinand Columbus]]'s biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]] two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been [[Inuit]] who had drifted off course.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian contact between [[Alaska]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] via the [[subarctic]] [[Aleutian Islands]] would have been conceivable, but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the American side and its western continuation, the [[Commander Islands]], remained uninhabited until after [[Vitus Bering|Russian explorers]] encountered the [[Aleut people]] in 1741.

In 1650, a British preacher in Norfolk, Thomas Thorowgood, published ''Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm Oliver's Bookshelf, The Premier Web-Site for Early Mormon History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184039/http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1652 [[Hamon L'Estrange|Sir Hamon L'Estrange]], an English author writing on history and theology, published ''Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race'' in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a [[Puritan]] missionary who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] published by  founder and leader [[Joseph Smith Jr]] in 1830 at the age of twenty-four, states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples who sailed from the Old World. Mormon groups such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] attempt to study and expand on these ideas. Scientific consensus rejects these claims.

The [[National Geographic Society]], in a 1998 letter to the [[Institute for Religious Research]], stated "Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mit.irr.org/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon "National Geographic Society Statement on the Book of Mormon"].  August 12, 1998.  Letter from Julie Crain addressed to Luke Wilson of the Institute for Religious Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LDS scholars hold the view that archaeological study of Book of Mormon claims are not meant to vindicate the literary narrative.  For example, [[Terryl Givens]], professor of English at the University of Richmond, points out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the Book of Mormon in relation to modern archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref name="Givens2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Givens|first=Terryl|title=The Latter-day Saint Experience i n America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEEkTWyIpZkC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32750-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Professor M. Wells Jakeman popularized a belief that the [[Izapa Stela 5]] represents the Book of Mormon prophets Lehi and Nephi's [[tree of life vision]], and was a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-Columbian settlement in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;*{{aut|Brewer, Stewart W.}}, (1999); [http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&amp;id=180 "The History of an Idea: The Scene on Stela 5 from Izapa, Mexico, as a Representation of Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life"], (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-Columbian contact have been disputed.&lt;ref name="Paulson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paulson|first=Matthew A.|title=Breaking the Mormon Code|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pbi_OfkPhzwC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2000-09-01|publisher=WingSpan Press|isbn=978-1-59594-067-4|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, scholarship on the Book of Mormon has concentrated on cultural parallels rather than "smoking gun" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lund|first=John|title=MesoAmerica And The Book of Mormon|date=2007-11-22|publisher=Granite Publishing &amp; Distribution|isbn=978-1891114403|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joseph|title=Exploring the Lands of the Book of Mormon|date=1989-06-15|publisher=S.A.

__NOTOC__
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are several definitions of '''protoscience'''.

Its simplest meaning (most closely reflecting its roots of ''[[wikt:proto-#Prefix|proto-]]'' + ''[[science]]'') involves the earliest eras of the [[history of science]], when the [[scientific method]] was still nascent. Thus, in the late 17th century and early 18th century, [[Isaac Newton]] contributed to the dawning sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], even though he was also an [[alchemy|alchemist]] who sought [[chrysopoeia]] in various ways including some that were unscientific. 

Another meaning extends this idea into the present, with protoscience being an emerging field of study which is still not completely scientific, but later becomes a proper science.&lt;ref name=Bunge&gt;{{cite article | last=Bunge | first=Mario | title=What is pseudoscience?| year=1984 | publisher=The Skeptical Inquirer |volume=9 | pages=36-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of it would the [[general theory of relativity]], which started being a protoscience (a theoretical work which had not been tested), but later was experimentally verified and became fully scientitific. Protoscience in this sense is distinguished from pseudoscience by a genuine willingness to be changed through new evidence, as opposed to having a theory that can always find a way to rationalize a predetermined belief.

[[Philosopher of chemistry]] Jaap Brakel defines protoscience as "the study of ''normative'' criteria for the use of experimental technology in science."&lt;ref&gt;Brakel, Jaap, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=XU1OwXNHN50C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=protoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xsn6Tty0BtO78gOz8oAZ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=protoscience&amp;f=false protoscience and protochemistry]", Philosophy of chemistry: between the manifest and the scientific image, Leuven Univ Pr, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Kuhn]] said that protosciences "generate testable conclusions but ... nevertheless resemble [[philosophy]] and [[the arts]] rather than the established sciences in their developmental patterns. I think, for example, of fields like [[chemistry]] and [[electricity]] before the mid-18th century, of the study of [[heredity]] and [[phylogeny]] before the mid-nineteenth, or of many of the [[social sciences]] today." While noting that they meet the demarcation criteria of [[falsifiability]] from [[Karl Popper|Popper]], he questions whether the discussion in protoscience fields "result[s] in clear-cut progress". Kuhn concluded that protoscience, "like the arts and philosophy, lack some element which, in the mature sciences, permits the more obvious forms of progress. It is not, however, anything that a methodological prescription can provide. ... I claim no therapy to assist the transformation of a proto-science to a science, nor do I suppose anything of this sort is to be had".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Thomas |editors=Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave | chapter = Reflections on my critics |title=Criticism and the growth of knowledge: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford college, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521096235 |edition=Reprint |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''prescientific'' means at root "relating to an era before science existed". For example, [[traditional medicine]] existed for thousands of years before medical science did, and thus many aspects of it can be described as prescientific. In a related but somewhat different [[word sense|sense]], protoscientific topics (such as the alchemy of Newton's day) can be called prescientific, in which case the ''proto-'' and ''pre-'' labels can function more or less [[synonym]]ously (the latter focusing more sharply on the idea that nothing but science is science).

Compare [[fringe science]], which is considered highly speculative or even strongly refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dutch, Steven I |title=Notes on the nature of fringe science |journal=[[J Geol Ed]] |issn=0022-1368 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |date=January 1982 |id=ERIC EJ260409 |oclc=427103550}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some protosciences go on to become an accepted part of [[Scientific consensus|mainstream science]].&lt;ref name=CFS&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419010537/http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html |date=April 19, 2012 |title=''Reflections on the reception of unconventional claims in science'' }}, newsletter ''Center for Frontier Sciences'', [[Temple University]] (1990).

The '''Regius Professor of Natural History''' is a [[Regius Professor]]ship at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland. It was originally called the Regius Professor of Civil and Natural History at [[Marischal College]] until in 1860 [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]]s merged to form the University of Aberdeen, and the title changed to Natural History.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">A '''research site''' is a place where people conduct research. Common research sites include universities, hospitals, research institutes, and [[field research]] locations.

==Clinical research==
In clinical research a research site conducts all or part of a [[clinical trial]]. For clinical trials which recruit [[research participants]] in multiple locations, often the research will have a [[headquarters]] then multiple regional research sites to conduct the research in that region. In a network of research sites where all are recruiting study participants, sites with low recruitment benefit from coaching from sites with high recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=MR |last2=Kenworthy-Heinige |first2=T |last3=Beck |first3=DJ |last4=Asghar |first4=A |last5=Broussard |first5=EB |last6=Bratcher |first6=K |last7=Tommessilli |first7=LM |last8=Antonelli |first8=M |last9=Planeta |first9=BM |title=Research site mentoring: A novel approach to improving study recruitment. |journal=Contemporary clinical trials communications |date=March 2018 |volume=9 |pages=172-177 |doi=10.1016/j.conctc.2018.01.011 |pmid=29696240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of good clinical research sites include setting good timelines, early participant recruitment, and having a management plan for efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baer |first1=AR |last2=Bridges |first2=KD |last3=O'Dwyer |first3=M |last4=Ostroff |first4=J |last5=Yasko |first5=J |title=Clinical research site infrastructure and efficiency. |journal=Journal of oncology practice |date=September 2010 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=249-52 |doi=10.1200/JOP.000109 |pmid=21197190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in nursing have reported challenges accessing the facilities designated for conventional medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Høyland |first1=S |last2=Hollund |first2=JG |last3=Olsen |first3=OE |title=Gaining access to a research site and participants in medical and nursing research: a synthesis of accounts. |journal=Medical education |date=February 2015 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=224-32 |doi=10.1111/medu.12622 |pmid=25626753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of a research site should have a means of detecting fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knott |first1=Carol |last2=Henderson |first2=Joanne |last3=Bowman |first3=Louise |last4=Landray |first4=Martin |title=Investigating possible fraudulent activity at a research site |journal=Trials |date=16 November 2015 |volume=16 |issue=S2 |doi=10.1186/1745-6215-16-S2-P193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnographic research==
Researchers who do not have a cultural tie to a research population may have difficulty doing ethnographic research with that community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3b- Selecting a Research Site |url=http://www.engagingcommunities.org/proposing-the-ethnographic-research-project/3b-selecting-a-research-site/ |website=www.engagingcommunities.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science studies'''  is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area that seeks to situate scientific [[expertise]] in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its [[epistemology|epistemic]] and [[semiotics|semiotic]] role.

Similarly to [[cultural studies]], science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from [[scientometrics]] to [[ethnomethodology]] or [[cognitive science]]. Science studies have a certain importance for [[evaluation]] and science policy. Overlapping with the field of [[science, technology and society]], practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward [[Omphaloskepsis|navel-gazing]]: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; From early concerns with scientific [[discourse]], practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; Practical examples include [[bioethics]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), [[pollution]], [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Martello M (2004) Global change science and the Arctic citizen.Sci Public Policy 31(2):107–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff S (ed) (2004) States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order. Routledge, Abingdon&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomedical sciences]], [[physical sciences]], [[natural hazard]] predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;
The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and [[Epistemic cultures|cultures]] and [[laboratory life]] (compare [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* Science and technology (e.g. [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]])
* Science, technology and society (e.g. [[Peter Weingart]], [[Ulrike Felt]], [[Helga Nowotny]] and [[Reiner Grundmann]])
* Language and  [[rhetoric of science]] (e.g. [[Charles Bazerman]], [[Alan G. Gross]], Greg Myers)
* [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and science|aesthetics of science]] and visual culture in science (u.a. [[:de:Peter Geimer]]), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare [[mathematical beauty]]) and the relation between emotion, [[cognition]] and rationality in the development of science.&lt;ref&gt;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science   Volume 16,  Issue 1, 2002, Recent work on aesthetics of science DOI:10.1080/02698590120118783 James W. McAllister pages 7-11, 21 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[semiotics|Semiotic]] studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research.&lt;ref&gt;Organisierte Kreativität: Die vielen Gesichter der Innovation, Rene J.Jorna, in Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders ([[Sharon Traweek]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Traweek | first = Sharon | author-link = Sharon Traweek | title = Beamtimes and lifetimes: the world of high energy physicists | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674044449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[research ethics]], [[science policy]], and the role of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli: ''The science studies reader''. Routledge, New York 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-91867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price]]: ''Little Science, Big Science. Von der Studierstube zur Großforschung.'' Suhrkamp, 1982, {{ISBN|978-3518076484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the field ==
[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanislaw Ossowski]] started to introduce the concept in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kölbel: [http://www.dart-europe.eu/full.php?id=466024 ''Wissensmanagement in der Wissenschaft''], Berlin: Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftsforschung e.V. c/o Inst. f. Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 2002, elektronische Bereitstellung 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the [[history of science]], but also its [[history and philosophy of science|philosophical underpinnings]]. Kuhn's work established that the [[history of science]] was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of [[paradigm]]s to the [[philosophy of science]]. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. [[Sociology of scientific knowledge]] developed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where [[David Bloor]] and his colleagues developed what has been termed the '[[strong programme]]'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way.&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, "The strengths of the strong programme." Scientific rationality: The sociological turn (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

It proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US [[science wars]].&lt;ref name=thn/&gt; The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the "hard facts" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself.&lt;ref name=thn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = When things strike back: a possible contribution of ‘science studies’ to the social sciences | journal = [[British Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–123 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | date = March 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;  Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being [[Transcendental idealism|transcendent]], allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as [[Immanence#Continental philosophy|immanent]] as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale [[global issue]]s that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of "thing"&lt;ref&gt;In premodern times (and various languages) the term both meant an object and [[Thing (assembly)|an assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lash | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Lash |year=1999 | title = Objects that judge: Latour's parliament of things, in another modernity, a different rationality | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford  | isbn = 9780631164999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science studies scholars such as [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Steve Woolgar]] started already in the 1980s to involve "technology", and called their field '[[science, technology and society]]'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies&lt;/span&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Sergio+Sismondo%22 &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; Sergio Sismondo&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/span&gt;, 17.08.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "turn to technology" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as [[mapping controversies]] has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515123357/http://www.mappingcontroversies.co.uk/ |date=2009-05-15 }} mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]''), namely studies of ''expertise'' and ''experience'' answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies of Science April 2002 vol. 32 no. 2 235-296 The Third Wave of Science Studies Studies of Expertise and Experience H.M.

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
[[File:Pair of Herdwicks grazing.jpg|thumb|[[Herdwick]]s grazing in Cumbria]]

A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is [[Brian Wynne]]'s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah&gt;Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33–39
&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in [[Cumbria]], who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of [[radioactive contamination]], allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the [[Sellafield]] nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt; The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.&lt;ref&gt;Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology [[Scott Lash]] [[Bronislaw Szerszynski]], [[Brian Wynne]] SAGE, 05.04.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science studies / STS on volcanology ===
[[Image:Soufrière Hills volcanic aftermath (Aerial views, Montserrat, 2007) 02.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the 2007 [[Soufrière Hills]] eruption in Montserrat]]

Donovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for ''social studies of [[volcanology]]'' and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.&lt;ref name=vulc&gt;Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. doi:&lt;10.1007/s00445-011-0547-z insu-00691620&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the [[List of volcanoes in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Soufrière Hills|Montserrat]], [[Volcanology of Italy|Italy]] and [[Volcanology of Iceland|Iceland]] during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; 
A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the [[black swan theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Donovan et al. (2012) cite Taleb NN (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Allen Lane, London 
&lt;/ref&gt; directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the [[W. H. Bramble Airport|island's airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3666502.stm |title=BBC country profile: Montserrat |accessdate=2008-03-08 | date=22 September 2009 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4237882.stm |date=12 September 2005 |title=Montserrat evacuation remembered |publisher=BBC |accessdate= 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; It involved as well local knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

[[Volcanology]] as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.&lt;ref&gt;Horlick-Jones T, Sime J (2004) Living on the border: knowledge, risk and transdisciplinarity. Futures 36(4):441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experts and Democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare [[Risk society]]) to address its risks.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Beck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity |author=[[Ulrich Beck]] |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi |date=1992 |isbn=978-0803983465}} (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow [[Ulrich Beck]]'s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise ([[Sheila Jasanoff]] and [[Brian Wynne]], for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).&lt;ref name="CollinsEvans"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Expertise |first1= Harry |last1=Collins |first2=Robert |last2=Evans |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2007 |isbn=978-0226113623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins|first1=Harry |title=Interactional expertise as a third kind of knowledge |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=125–143 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000040824.89221.1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a '''scientific collection''' is referred to
*any systematic collection of objects for the study of [[nature]] or of the [[human history]]
*as well as the institutions, organizations or sub-organizations that build such collections preserve, develop systematically and make accessible and useful. These institutions often examine the collections also itself.

Important objects of research collections 
*in the field of [[Geology]] are in particular [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] samples and [[drilling core]]s,
*in the field of [[biology]] in particular [[plants]], [[fungi]], [[animals]], [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[viruses]] and their remains,
*in the field of [[history]] for example, wood samples with [[annual ring]]s, [[pottery]] and [[coin]]s not only for the study of these objects themselves, but also e.g. to determine the age of finds during excavations or [[ice core]]s and cores of [[sediment]]s in lakes for the study of [[climate history]] .

Important goals of these collections are the items collected for research to make tangible and accessible, hold reference objects for comparison purposes as well as the systematization and naming with scientific names of the collected objects ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]) .

== Indexing ==
The indexing of the collections was historically made by directories, catalogs, [[index card]]s, today supplemented by or replaced by [[database]]s with information such as e.g. scientific description, including picture, name, location, find circumstances, fund age, scientific analysis, phylogenetic relationships, [[DNA]] and [[isotope analysis]] results, analysis of pollutants, references, condition of the property, owner changes and name changes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dnfs.de/seite/die-sammlungen Die Sammlungen | Deutsche Naturwissenschaftliche Forschungssammlung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organisations support the indexing and handling of their collections by specialist libraries.

== Institutions ==
Research collections hold especially [[museum]]s, notably [[natural history museum]]s, [[botanical garden]]s, universities and other research institutions. There are also independent research collections, such as the Zoological State Collection Munich with over 20 million stuffed animals for research purposes. Public authorities such as national geological agencies or police units hold partly research collections too.

The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]] - with one of the biggest collections worldwide - is home to life and [[earth science]] specimens comprising some 70 million items within five main collections: [[botany]], [[entomology]], [[mineralogy]], [[palaeontology]] and [[zoology]].

Largest German Natural History Museum is the [[Museum für Naturkunde]], [[Berlin]],  with over 30 million objects, including 9 million [[beetle]]s and 275,000 jars with preserved in alcohol animals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

*The [[Musée de Minéralogie]] a museum of [[mineralogy]] operated by the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] (Mines ParisTech) containing some 100,000 samples including 80,000 [[mineral]]s, 15,000 rocks, 4,000 [[ore]]s, 400 [[meteorite]]s, 700 [[Gemstone|gem]]s, and 300 artificial minerals.
* The most important geological collections in Europe include the [[Museum of the Earth of Polish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Warsaw]] With more than 170,000 minerals, [[meteorite]]s, [[fossil]] and a [[Amber]] collection.

== Biological collections / Life Sciences collections ==

Typical collection objects biology are [[fossil]]s of organisms, in particular plants and animals, plants, and animals killed, and be protected from decay, for example, by drying or preparation, but also live plants, animals, bacteria and viruses.

Plant collections are referred to as [[herbaria]]. Live plants are collected in the [[Botanical garden]]s, ([[tree]]s ) in [[arboretum]]s, [[aquarium]]s, and partly in [[seedbank]]s, as well as e.g. algae from the Culture Collection of Algae Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/epsag/website/cgi/show_page.cgi?kuerzel=about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901120126/http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/epsag/website/cgi/show_page.cgi?kuerzel=about |archivedate=2012-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Live animals are collected in [[zoo]]s and aquariums.
The great Old Botanical Garden of the University of Göttingen e.g. represents about a collection of 17,000 species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/108651.html Georg-August-Universität Göttingen - Alter Botanischer Garten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly well known in Germany are the major research collections of the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]] of Senckenberg Society for Nature Research in [[Frankfurt am Main]] with over 22 million natural objects (Herbaria 1 Million). Senckenberg offers to open up his collection to the SESAM database.

The [[Macaulay Library]] is the world's largest archive of animal sounds. It includes more than 175,000 audio recordings covering 75 percent of the world's bird species. There are an ever increasing numbers of insect, fish, frog, and mammal recordings. The video archive includes over 50,000 clips, representing over 3,500 species.

An example for a special collection are the objects of the [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen]] (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures).

Remarkable and big Biological collections (more than 1,000,000 specimens) in Europe are
*in France: [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], [[Paris]] contains 9,500,000 specimens; [[Université Montpellier]] contains 4,000,000 specimens; [[Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1]] contains 4,000,000 specimens
*in Russia: [[Komarov Botanical Institute]] in [[St. Petersburg]] contains 7,160,000 specimens,

== History / Human Heritage collections ==
[[Dendrochronology]] is located on the border between biology and history. An annual ring table or tree-ring calendar is a time series of [[tree ring]] s of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] art tree. Because of the specific growth of each tree species and regional differences of climate, such a table must always refer to a single species from the same region. Important tree chronologies are:
* [[Hohenheimer Jahrringkalender]] (Hohenheim tree-ring calendar), complete 12,483 years back to 10,480 BC in the [[Younger Dryas]]
* [[Aegean Dendrochronology Project]] to 1800 BC, [[Bronze Age]]
* [[Belfast Chronology]] 5474 BC
* [[English standard curve]] to 5,012 BC
* [[Bristlecone Pine Chronology]] extends back 8500 years exists for the bristlecone pine in the Southwest US ([[White Mountains of California]])
* [[Sequoiadendron giganteum Chronology]]

Remerkable History collections:
*The [[National Numismatic Collection]] is the national coin [[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]] of the United States.

'''Scientific lacuna''' describes an area of science that has not been studied but has the potential to be studied scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Translation Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-SnQWJLO4EC|website=Google books|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2013|isbn=9781136242144|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, this may be the case because it falls between different areas of sciences, such that it doesn't fall into a single specific [[discipline]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lewis and Clark: Pioneering Naturalists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWbS4RHIXp8C|website=Google books|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2003|isbn=9780803264342}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also may be the case that the right situation for study has not yet occurred, or the conditions for study have been too [[ephemeral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies on the Structure of Time: From Physics to Psycho(patho)logy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMsDqsvcxckC|website=Google books|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2000|isbn=9780306464393|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific lacunae often have the potential to be studied in the future when more areas of sciences are explicitly defined or the right conditions do occur, yet this can be made difficult if the area of science is commonly not considered a proper area for [[Scientific method|scientific study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|title=American Medical Association|volume=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqUhAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=1900|issue= |publisher=American Medical Association.|issn=0002-9955|page=202|doi=10.1001/jama.1900.24610040009001b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2760">'''Secondary research''' involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research. Secondary research is contrasted with primary research in that primary research involves the generation of data, whereas secondary research uses primary research sources as a source of data for analysis.&lt;ref name=ithaca&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary and Secondary Sources|url=https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary|website=library.ithaca.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable marker of primary research is the inclusion of a "methods" section, where the authors describe how the data was generated.

Common examples of secondary research include [[textbooks]], [[encyclopedia]]s, [[news]] articles, [[review articles]], and [[meta analysis|meta analyses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ormsby|first1=Tim|title=Search Smart: Types of Research: Secondary Research|url=http://flinders.libguides.com/researchtypes/secondary|website=flinders.libguides.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Camille|title=LibGuides: Scholarly Literature Types: Primary vs. Secondary Articles|url=http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=293669&amp;p=2004549|website=guides.library.cornell.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When conducting secondary research, authors may draw data from published academic papers, government documents, statistical databases, and historical records.&lt;ref name=ithaca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosch|first1=Eileen|title=LibGuides: Library Basics: Primary and Secondary Sources|url=http://libguides.bgsu.edu/c.php?g=227153&amp;p=1505675|website=libguides.bgsu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
The term is widely used in [[health research]], [[legal research]] and [[market research]]. The principal methodology in health secondary research is the [[systematic review]], commonly using meta-analytic statistical techniques, but other methods of synthesis, like realist reviews and meta-narrative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 Diffusion of Innovations in Health Service Organisations: a systematic literature review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202203417/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviews, have been developed in recent years. Such secondary research uses the primary research of others typically in the form of research publications and reports.

In a market research context, secondary research is taken to include the reuse, by a second party, of any data collected by a first party, such as telephone interviews or surveys.

'''São Carlos''' (Saint Charles, in English, {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ ˈkaʁlus}}; named after [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]]) is a city of 246,088&lt;ref name="IBGE" /&gt; inhabitants ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2017) in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{coord|22|01|04|S|47|53|27|W|}}, at about 230&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[São Paulo]].

==History==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiás]]. Leaving from [[Piracicaba]], passing through [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the "Pinhal" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the "Pinhal" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the "Pinhal" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to [[Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal]], an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to [[village]] in 1865, when a "Câmara", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a [[city]] in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] to the [[Port of Santos|Santos harbor]] and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being [[Italian Brazilians|Italians]] - specifically, [[Northern Italy|Northern Italians]]. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools.  This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the [[University of São Paulo]], was created. In the 1970s, the [[Federal University of São Carlos]] was launched.

==Geography==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately {{convert|231|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]]. The city is the center of a [[Microregion of São Carlos|microregion]] with 308,777 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census of the IBGE - Synopsis - Table 761|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/cd/cd2010sp.asp?o=3&amp;i=P|publisher=IBGE.gov.br|accessdate=22 July 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed "''Cidade do Clima''" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called "''Festa do Clima''", or "Weather Festival".

The city has a total area of 1.141&amp;nbsp;km², which includes two districts to the north (''Santa Eudóxia'' and ''Água Vermelha''), one district to the west (''Bela Vista São-carlense''), and one district to the east (''Vila Nery'').

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]], the city has an altitude tropical climate with dry winter, with minimum average temperatures of 15,3&amp;nbsp;°C and maximum of 27,0&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Economy==
The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by [[Embrapa]], owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed "The National Capital of Technology" by Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2011.

The city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as [[Faber Castell]], [[Electrolux]], [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]], [[Tecumseh Products Company|Tecumseh]] and the Brazilian plant of [[Volkswagen]] [[engine]]s, and national corporations such as [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM MRO - Technology Center]], [[Toalhas São Carlos]], [[Tapetes São Carlos]], [[Papel São Carlos]], [[Prominas Brasil]] and [[Latina (industry)|Latina]].

The economic basis of São Carlos is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]]. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city's GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo's average. The [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Profile at SEADE|url=http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|publisher=SEADE.gov.br|accessdate=12 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823080724/http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

São Carlos is home to two [[University of São Paulo|Universidade de São Paulo]] campuses and the  [[Federal University of São Carlos|Universidade Federal de São Carlos]] (UFSCar), two of the most important higher learning centers in Brazil. Moreover, another minor and private university, [[Centro Universitário Central Paulista]] (UNICEP), is also based in São Carlos, and community colleges like [[SENAI]], [[Industrial Social Services|SESI]], [[Serviço Social do Comércio|SESC]], [[Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Comercial|SENAC]] and the ''Escola Técnica Estadual Paulino Botelho''. This has turned São Carlos into a university-oriented town, with an abundance of student-focused commercial establishments. It is also known for its student parties.

São Carlos' cultural life is marked by a young audience that enjoys musical concerts of Brazilian contemporary alternative artists that usually include the city in their tours. Also, São Carlos has 3 theaters and 7 commercial movie-theaters rooms.

There are two important events celebrated every year in the city, the ''Climate Party'', which happens in April and has a traditional ''Orchid Exposition'' which features a craftwork fair and several food barracks. An [[Oktobertech]] fest is held yearly along with the [[São Carlos High Tech Fair]] (Fealtec).

'''Convergence''' is a phenomenon in telecommunication and media industry to integrate services, content offerings, and means of communication under one core technology or ecosystem. It includes cultural, society, business, service, technology, regulatory, and content aspects that need to be considered.

It’s practical application manifests in various concrete examples, as e.g. Internet, digital convergence, media convergence, home applications, and telecommunication. This article describes a wide are of aspects of convergence, with illustrations of convergent merging technologies (NBIC, nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive technologies) and convergence of media technology.

==Definitions==
"'''''Convergence''' is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process''" (Roco 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roco | first1 = MC | year = 2002 | title = 'Coherence and divergence of megatrends in science and engineering | url =https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020157027792 | journal = J Nanopart Res | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 9–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge and Roco 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bainbridge | first1 = W.S. | last2 = Roco | first2 = M.C. | year = 2016 | title = 'Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence | url = | journal = J. Nanoparticle Res. | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 211 | doi=10.1007/s11051-016-3520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[File:Leatherman-Charge-XTi.jpg|thumb|A converged mechanical tool, the multitool. Within one device, it provides many tools.]]
Siddhartha Menon defines convergence, in his ''Policy initiative Dilemmas on Media Covergence: A Cross National Perspective'', as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as "a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform".&lt;ref&gt;Siddhartha, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. [[Jan van Dijk]] suggests that "digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros".&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J. (1999). The network society. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Siddhartha. "Policy Initiative Dilemmas On Media Convergence: A Cross National Perspective." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–35. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 20 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is defined by Blackman, 1998, as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Convergence between telecommunications and other media: how should regulation adapt? | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 163–170 | doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, 1998; Gates, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conlins | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = Back to the future: Digital Television and Convergence in the United Kingdom | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 4–5| pages = 383–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gate | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Convergence and competition: Technological change, industry concentration and competition policy in the telecommunications sector | url = | journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 83–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Digital Convergence and its consequences | url = | journal = Javnost/The Public | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1080/13183222.1999.11008716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media technological convergence''' is the tendency that as [[technological change|technology changes]], different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called "network convergence") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]]. Many experts{{who|date=May 2013}} view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of [[information and communication technology]] devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. 
Convergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]]. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market.&lt;ref name = "Shin"&gt;Shin, Dong Hee, Won – Yong Kim, and Dong-Hoon Lee. "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–19. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, W. and Levin, S. (2005). From Clones To Packets: The Development Of Competition In Local Residential Telecommunications. TPRC 2005 The 33rd Research Conference on Communication, Information and Internet Policy, September 23–25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of media technological convergence ==

Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd.|pages=163–170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. "The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent."&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies.
[[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} "The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress." Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ramón Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called "Mediamorphosis" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".&lt;ref&gt;(Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York University Press, New York.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NBIC''', an acronym for [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]], was, in 2014,  the most popular term for converging technologies. It was introduced into public discourse through the publication of ''[[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]'', a report sponsored in part by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Roco, Mihail C.| editor2 = Bainbridge, William Sims| editor2-link = William Sims Bainbridge| title = [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]| publisher = Springer| date = 2003| isbn = 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as GNR ([[Genetics|'''G'''enetics]], '''N'''anotechnology and [[Robotics|'''R'''obotics]]) ([[Bill Joy]], 2000, [[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us|Why the future doesn't need us]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us | first = Bill | last= Joy | authorlink= Bill Joy | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html |publisher= Wired |date= 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Journalist [[Joel Garreau]] in ''[[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human'' uses "GRIN", for '''G'''enetic, '''R'''obotic, '''I'''nformation, and '''N'''ano processes,&lt;ref name="Garreau 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Garreau, Joel| author-link = Joel Garreau| title = [[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human| publisher =Doubleday| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-385-50965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[science journalist]] Douglas Mulhall in ''Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World'' uses "GRAIN", for '''G'''enetics, '''R'''obotics, [[Artificial intelligence|'''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence]], and '''N'''anotechnology.&lt;ref name="Mulhall 2002"&gt;{{cite book| author = Mulhall, Douglas| title = Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World| publisher =Prometheus Books| date = 2002 | isbn = 1-57392-992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another acronym coined by the [[:Category:Appropriate technology organizations|appropriate technology organization]] [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] is "BANG" for "[[Bit|'''B'''it]]s, [[Atom|'''A'''tom]]s, [[Neuron|'''N'''euron]]s, [[Gene|'''G'''ene]]s".&lt;ref name="ETC Group 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = ETC Group| author-link = ETC Group (AGETC)| title = The Strategy for Converging Technologies: The Little BANG Theory| date = 2003| url = http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| accessdate = 2007-02-09| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925235057/http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| archivedate = 2007-09-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of technology implications ==

Convergent solutions include both [[Landline|fixed-line]] and mobile technologies. Recent examples of new, convergent services include:

* Using the Internet for voice and [[video telephony]]
* [[Video on demand]]
* [[Fixed-mobile convergence]]
* [[Mobile-to-mobile convergence]]
* [[Location-based service]]s
* Integrated products and bundles

Convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions. Convergent technologies include:

* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]]
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]
* [[IPTV]]
* [[Voice over IP]]
* [[Voice call continuity]]
* [[DVB-H|Digital video broadcasting – handheld]]

==Convergence in appliances==
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or "black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n21/mode/2|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 071|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, media business practice has been to identify the next "black box" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as "black boxes" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the "black box" theory, and instead creates clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other "black box" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: "...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context." Despite the creation of "black boxes", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.&lt;ref&gt;Cheskin Research. "Designing Digital Experiences for Youth", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the "smart phone," a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they  incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. This type of convergence is popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the "improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; He believes the same technology has the potential to be "used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

==Convergence on the internet==
The role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as "Connected TV" or "Hybrid TV", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital convergence==
Digital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called "spokes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=1599041561|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] "[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194/A_Computing_Studio_Method_for_Teaching_Design_Thinking|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|publisher=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content, mixing personal (user-generated) content with professional (copyright protected) content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/the-new-media-ownership-law-doesnt-address-the-real-crisis-journalism-is-facing|title=The new media ownership law doesn't address the real crisis journalism is facing|publisher=The Guardian|author=Margaret Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example are personal music videos that combine user-generated photos with chart music. The German startup [[Trivid GmbH]] has developed [[Clipgenerator]] that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Bebo]].

==Convergence in the marketplace==
Convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies ("telcos"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.

==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==
Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted"&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt; They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the "social-side effects," in that "the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating."&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"&gt;Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.
Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, p.101-112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5¡V12.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Casey. "Games Are Not Convergence: The Lost Promise Of Digital Production And Convergence." Convergence: The Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies 17.3 (2011): 271–286.

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news “island” in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pavlic J. V. New Media Journalism // 21st Century Communication. A Reference Handbook. Volume 1 &amp; 2. /Ed. By William F. Eadie. Los Angeles, 2009. 970 p. P. 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture An Introduction To Mass Communication. 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013. 9–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity."&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;Holt, Jennifer, and Alisa Perren, eds. Media Industries History, Theory and Method. West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence culture ===

[[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process "where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"&gt;HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video.

The association of Bert and Bin Laden links back to the Ignacio's Photoshop project for fun.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide''. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Convergence culture is a part of [[participatory culture]]. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. 
Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"/&gt;

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:

{{quote|...a "catalyst" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Cell phone convergence ===
The social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Another example, [[Rok Sako To Rok Lo]] (2004) was screened in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and other part of India through EDGE-enabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Social movements ===
The integration of [[social movement]]s in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as "the first informational guerrilla movement".&lt;ref&gt;Castells, 2004:82&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1988:630&lt;/ref&gt; A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, "Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;Papic, M., Noonan, S. (2011) "Social Media As a Tool for Protest." Stratfor, 3 Feb. 2011. Web. 20 Nov. 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512075702/http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study, "Journalism in the age of media convergence: a survey of undergraduates’ technology-related news habits", concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence, such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story, as part of their Web-based news consumption, a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, L,.

== Examples in Regulation ==

===Example: VoIP===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;Written in 2011, 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57&lt;/ref&gt; Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.&lt;ref&gt;PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda." Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. 
"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests"(Blackman).&lt;ref&gt;

===Emerging trends in communications===
[[Network neutrality]] has emerged as an issue. Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, "a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development." Second, "neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, 2004d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. "Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: "From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.&lt;ref name = "Shin"/&gt; The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"&gt;Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications
Public Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer – the provider of service. 3. Application layer –  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer – the layer which users see.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"/&gt; In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online &lt;PDF&gt;. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Messaging==
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should soon{{when|date=May 2011}} be able to let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or [[long number]]. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

==Example: Mobile==
"Mobile service provisions" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as "The [[Fantastic Four]]" or "Grand Slam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

==Example: Home network==
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pleasure of Finding Things Out''''' is a collection of short works from American [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]], including interviews, speeches, lectures, and printed articles. Among these is his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]", his report on the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], and his speech on scientific integrity in which he coined the term "[[cargo cult science]]". The original foreword was written by [[Freeman Dyson]].

In US [[academia]], a '''visiting scholar''', '''visiting researcher''', '''visiting fellow''', '''visiting lecturer''' or '''visiting professor''' is a scholar from an institution who visits a host university and is projected to teach, lecture, or perform research on a topic the visitor is valued for.&lt;ref&gt;CMU. [http://www.cmu.edu/mcs/handbook/nonsalary.html "MCS Non-Salaried Scholarly Appointments: Visiting scholar appointments"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824001210/http://www.cmu.edu/mcs/handbook/nonsalary.html |date=2007-08-24 }}. [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the position is not salaried because the scholar typically is salaried by their home institution (or partially salaried, as in some cases of [[sabbatical leave]] from US universities), while some visiting positions are salaried. 

Typically, a position as visiting scholar is for a couple of months or even a year,&lt;ref&gt;HLS. [http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/graduate/admissions/vrvs.php "Visiting Scholar and Researcher (VS/VR) Program"]. [[Harvard Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UT. [http://www.utexas.edu/research/resources/visiting-scholar-researcher-program "Visiting Scholar"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304063017/http://www.utexas.edu/research/resources/visiting-scholar-researcher-program |date=2015-03-04 }}. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt; though it can be extended. It is not unusual that host institutions provide accommodation for the visiting scholar. Typically, a visiting scholar is invited by the host institution. Being invited as a visiting scholar is often regarded as a significant accolade and recognition of the scholar's prominence in the field. Attracting prominent visiting scholars often allows the permanent faculty and graduate students to cooperate with prominent academics from other institutions, especially foreign ones.

In the UK, a visiting scholar or visiting academic usually has to pay a so-called '''bench fee''' to the university, which will give them access to a shared office space and other university facilities and resources (such as the library). Bench fee amounts vary across the UK universities. 

==Overview==
The purpose of a visiting scholars programs is generally to bring to the university or educational institution in question an exceptional senior scholar who can contribute to and enrich the community's intellectual and research endeavors and international projection. Hence, in addition to conducting their own research, visitors are often expected to actively participate in a number of productive institutional activities, such as:

* Deliver a formal lecture to the host institution
* Engage in formal or informal discussions with graduate or postgraduate research students 
* Undertake collaborative research with faculty or staff 
* Contribute to the university's teaching by presenting guest lectures or faculty seminars
* Present a paper as part of the university's seminar program
